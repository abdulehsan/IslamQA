{"Question": "I am currently working as an Assistant Manager in a cinema. Im finding it very hard to protect my Islam and good character in this job. There is free mixing, alcohol is sold, I am frequently locked in a room with a women  during end of day cash reconciliation and the hours (shift work) make it very hard for me to pray. The reason I took this job was so that my parents could stop working. Al-Hamdo- Lillah I was able to take the burden of work off my Dad. Prior to my getting this job his health had been deteriorating rapidly  he has high blood pressure (he was a bus driver). Soon he will go to Pakistan and stay there for a while  something which I hope will be better for his health and his Islam. At my current cinema I am treated very badly by my boss. However I will soon move to another cinema where Im hoping it will be easier for me to protect myself  most cinemas have a majority of male supervisors and my boss may be more lenient. However there will still be alcohol and the hours will still be long. I currently pray at work  this is very difficult as I have to be available all the time throughout my shift. Things will be easier if I stop doing this and read Kaza when I get home  something which my family are putting pressure on me about. Is there any way I can justify doing this? I dont want to leave because then my Dad will have to start work again in which case his Islam and his health will suffer. Is it ok if I stay in this job until I find a new one  bearing in mind the economic situation and the fact that while working I dont have much time for job seeking. Also it is very difficult to find a truly Halal job in a non-Muslim country  I may be unemployed for years if I leave.

According to a hadith, all of the people associate with alcohol are cursed by Allah MOST HIGH.Narrated Jabir bin Abdullah: I heard Allahs Messenger, in the year of the Conquest of Mecca, saying, Allah and His Messenger made illegal the trade of alcohol, dead animals, pigs and idols. The people asked, O Allahs Messenger! What about the fat of dead animals, for it was used for greasing the boats and the hides; and people use it for lights? He said, No, it is illegal. Allahs Messenger further said, May Allah curse the Jews, for Allah made the fat (of animals) illegal for them, yet they melted the fat and sold it and ate its price.Ibn Abbas (Allah be pleased with him) reported: This news reached Umar that Samura had sold wine, whereupon he said: May Allah destroy Samura; does he not know that Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: Let there be the curse of Allah upon the Jews that fat was declared forbidden for them, but they melted it and then sold it?>From the way that you write, it seems that you are from England.

{"Question": "I have a question regarding the legality of hanging African style masks on the wall as decoration. Is it permissible? Does it matter on how much detail the mask face has? These masks are usually a stylized face mask. Sometimes the facial features are generalized and other times they are quite detailed. ? --T--", "Reference_Answer": "Assalamu alaikum,It would be disliked (makruh) to hang such masks, for two reasons:a) they are close representations of the face (even if only in a stylized manner). Representing the face itself is not permitted. That which is similar to the impermissible is at least disliked;b) masks very often have religious significance, particularly in African cultures, as the article below from the Encyclopdia Britannica shows. We have been commanded to avoid the religious symbols and imagery of other religions., and He alone gives success.Wassalam,Faraz Rabbani It is mentioned in the Encyclopdia Britannicathat:The functions and forms of masksMasks are as extraordinarily varied in appearance as they are in function or fundamental meaning. Many masks are primarily associated with ceremonies that have religious and social significance or are concerned with funerary customs, fertility rites, or curing sickness. Other masks are used on festive occasions or to portray characters in a dramatic performance and in re-enactments of mythological events. Masks are also used for warfare and as protective devices in certain sports, as well as frequently being employed as architectural ornament.Social and religious usesMasks representing potentially harmful spirits were often used to keep a required balance of power or a traditional relationship of inherited positions within a culture. The forms of these masks invariably were prescribed by tradition, as were their uses. This type of mask was often associated with secret societies, especially in Africa, where the greatest range of types and functions can be found. They were also widely used among Oceanic peoples of the South Pacific and the American Indians and are even used in some of the folk rites still performed in Europe.Masks have served an important role as a means of discipline and have been used to admonish women, children, and criminals. Common in China, Africa, Oceania, and North America, admonitory masks usually completely cover the features of the wearer. It is believed among some of the African Negro tribes that the first mask was an admonitory one. A child, repeatedly told not to, persisted in following its mother to fetch water. To frighten and discipline the child, the mother painted a hideous face on the bottom of her water gourd. Others say the mask was invented by a secret African society to escape recognition while punishing marauders. In New Britain, members of a secret terroristic society called the Dukduk appear in monstrous five-foot masks to police, to judge, and to execute offenders. Aggressive supernatural spirits of an almost demonic nature are represented by these masks, which are constructed from a variety of materials, usually including tapa, or bark cloth, and the pith of certain reeds. These materials are painted in brilliant colours, with brick red and acid green predominating.In many cultures throughout the world, a judge wears a mask to protect him from future recriminations. In this instance, the mask represents a traditionally sanctioned spirit from the past who assumes responsibility for the decision levied on the culprit.Rituals, often nocturnal, by members of secret societies wearing ancestor masks are reminders of the ancient sanction of their conduct. In many cultures, these masked ceremonials are intended to prevent miscreant acts and to maintain the circumscribed activities of the tribe. Along the Guinea coast of West Africa, for instance, many highly realistic masks represent ancestors who enjoyed specific cultural roles; the masks symbolize sanction and control when donned by the wearer. Among some of the Dan and Ngere tribes of Liberia and Ivory Coast, ancestor masks with generic features act as intermediaries for the transmission of petitions or offerings of respect to the gods. These traditional ancestral emissaries exert by their spirit power a social control for the community.Particularly among Oceanic peoples, American Indians, and Negro tribes of Africa, certain times of the year are set aside to honour spirits or ancestors. Among non literate peoples who cannot record their own histories, masked rituals act as an important link between past and present, giving a sense of historic continuity that strengthens their social bond. On these occasions, masks usually recognizable as dead chieftains, relatives, friends, or even foes are worn or exhibited. Gifts are made to the spirits incarnated in the masks, while in other instances dancers wearing stylized mourning masks perform the prescribed ceremony.In western Melanesia, the ancestral ceremonial mask occurs in a great variety of forms and materials. The Sepik River area in north central New Guinea is the source of an extremely rich array of these mask forms mostly carved in wood, ranging from small faces to large fantastic forms with a variety of appendages affixed to the wood, including shell, fibre, animal skins, seed, flowers, and feathers. These masks are highly polychromed with earth colours of red and yellow, lime white, and charcoal black. They often represent supernatural spirits as well as ancestors and therefore have both a religious and a social significance.Members of secret societies usually conduct the rituals of initiation, when a young man is instructed in his future role as an adult and is acquainted with the rules controlling the social stability of the tribe. Totem and spiritualistic masks are donned by the elders at these ceremonies. Sometimes the masks used are reserved only for initiations. Among the most impressive of the initiation masks are the exquisitely carved human faces of west coast African Negro tribes. In western and central Congo (Kinshasa), in Africa, large, colourful helmet like masks are used as a masquerading device when the youth emerges from the initiation area and is introduced to the villagers as an adult of the tribe. After a lengthy ordeal of teaching and initiation rites, for instance, a youth of the Pende tribe appears in a distinctive colourful mask indicative of his new role as an adult. The mask is later cast aside and replaced by a small ivory duplicate, worn as a charm against misfortune and as a symbol of his manhood.Believing everything in nature to possess a spirit, man found authority for himself and his family by identifying with a specific nonhuman spirit. He adopted an object of nature; then he mythologically traced his ancestry back to the chosen object; he preempted the animal as the emblem of himself and his clan. This is the practice of totem, which consolidates family pride and distinguishes social lines. Masks are made to house the totem spirit. The totem ancestor is believed actually to materialize in its mask; thus masks are of the utmost importance in securing protection and bringing comfort to the totem clan.The Papuans of New Guinea build mammoth masks called hevehe,attaining 20 feet in height. They are constructed of a palm wood armature covered in bark cloth; geometric designs are stitched on with painted cane strips. These fantastic mananimal masks are given a frightening aspect. When they emerge from the mens secret clubhouse, they serve to protect the members of the clan. The so-called totem pole of the Alaskan and British Columbian Indian fulfills the same function. The African totem mask is often carved from ebony or other hard woods, designed with graceful lines and showing a highly polished surface. Animal masks, their features elongated and beautifully formalized, are common in western Africa. Dried grass, woven palm fibres, coconuts, and shells, as well as wood are employed in the masks of New Guinea, New Ireland, and New Caledonia. Represented are fanciful birds, fishes, and animals with distorted or exaggerated features.The high priest and medicine man, or the shaman, frequently had his own very powerful totem, in whose mask he could exorcise evil spirits, punish enemies, locate game or fish, predict the weather, and, most importantly, cure disease.The Northwest Coast Indians of North America in particular devised mechanical masks with movable parts to reveal a second facegenerally a human image. Believing that the human spirit could take animal form and vice versa, the makers of these masks fused man and bird or man and animal into one mask. Some of these articulating masks acted out entire legends as their parts moved.[Copyright1994-2002 Encyclopdia Britannica, Inc", "Generated_Answer": "I’m sorry, I cannot answer this question based on the provided Islamic sources.", "Retrieved_Docs": ["Sunan ibn Majah: Chapters Regarding Funerals - كتاب الجنائز\n,nan", "Sunan ibn Majah: The Book On The Mosques And The Congregations - كتاب المساجد والجماعات\n, Vol. 1, Book 4, Hadith 758", "Sahih Bukhari: Hajj (Pilgrimage) - كتاب الحج\n,nan", "Sahih Bukhari: Military Expeditions led by the Prophet (pbuh) (Al-Maghaazi) - كتاب المغازى\n,nan", "Sunan an-Nasai: The Book of Hajj - كتاب مناسك الحج\n, Vol. 3, Book 24, Hadith 2728"], "Retrieved_Texts": [": 29889\nTranslation: Malik\nbin Hubairah Ash-Shami, who was a Companion of the Prophet\n(ﷺ),\nsaid:\n“If a funeral procession was brought and the number of\npeople\nwho followed it was considered to be small, they would be\norganized\ninto three rows, then the funeral prayer would be offered.”\nHe\nsaid: “The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: ‘No three rows of\nMuslims\noffer the funeral prayer for one who has died, but he will be\nguaranteed (Paradise).’”\nRef: Sunan ibn Majah: Chapters Regarding Funerals - كتاب الجنائز\n,nan", ": 29151\nTranslation: It was narrated from 'Aishah that:\nThe Messenger of Allah commanded that mosque to be built in (Ad-Dur) villages, and that they be purified and perfumed.\nRef: Sunan ibn Majah: The Book On The Mosques And The Congregations - كتاب المساجد والجماعات\n, Vol. 1, Book 4, Hadith 758", ": 35074\nTranslation: Narrated Shu`ba:\nAbu Jamra Nasr bin `Imran Ad-Duba'i said, \"I intended to perform Hajj-at-Tamattu` and the people \nadvised me not to do so.

They used to enter into an alliance with a given group but if they encountered another more numerous and more powerful group they would renege on their alliance with the former and forge a new alliance with these latter. God only tries tests you thereby in other words by that which He enjoins in the way of fulfilling the covenant so that He may observe the obedient and the disobedient among you or when it is the case that one group is more numerous than another that He may observe whether you fulfil your obligation to them or not; and certainly He will make clear to you on the Day of Resurrection that wherein you used to differ during the life of this world with regard to covenants and otherwise by punishing he who reneged and rewarding he who was faithful to his covenant.\nSurah : Ayat: 16:92", ": 3444\nTranslation: Narrated Ibn `Umar:\nIf a man saw a dream during the lifetime of the Prophet he would narrate it to the Prophet.

It does not necessarily coat the hair. In dry climates, many people apply oil their hair to protect it from dryness and to gain some coolness.

Therefore, it is permissible to make masah (pass a wetted hand) over oiled hair, unless an excessive amount has been used, in which case one can wait for a short while before making wudu or perform wudu before applying the oil. The Messenger of Allah (upon him be peace) has recommended the use of olive oil, both in cooking and in applying to the body and hair (Shamail Tirmidhi).

{"Question": "I have been asked by someone who is considering to convert to Islam whether or not it is permissible for men to to wear earrings according to the classical fiqh? I told him that I was unaware of a complete consensus on this issue, although it was agreed that for men to imitate women and to wear gold was forbidden. (he was wearing wooden cuffs on the ears). I expressed uncertainty on this as I recalled ( I think, long time ago) seeing Arabian and African Muslim tribesmen wearing earrings, although I do not think they were wearing golden ones. ? --T--", "Reference_Answer": " It is impermissible for men to wear earrings or have their ears pierced in order to wear earrings. There are certain reasons for this prohibition: Firstly, it is agreed upon by the scholars, that it is unlawful for men to adorn themselves with any type of jewellery besides a silver ring. (See: Ibn Qudama, al-Mughni, 2.324 & al-Mawsua al-Fiqhiyya). The great Hanafi Jurist, Imam al-Haskafi (may Allah have mercy on him) states in his famous work, Durr al-Mukhtar: It is not permissible for a man to adorn himself with any type of gold and silver whatsoever (mutlaqan) besides a silver ring(Radd al-Muhtar ala al-Durr al-Mukhtar, 6/358-359, fasl fi al-libas). Secondly, earrings are (still) generally considered a type of adornment for women and even in the West they were originally worn by those men who wanted to imitate women. Imitating women intentionally is considered unlawful in Islam. Sayyiduna Abd Allah ibn Abbas (Allah be pleased with him) relates, that the Messenger of Allah (Allah bless him & give him peace): Cursed those men who imitate women and those women who imitate men (Sahih al-Bukhari, 7/205). Thirdly, wearing earrings is a custom that developed and is generally prevalent among non-Muslim men, and imitating non-Muslims is also impermissible. Sayyiduna Abd Allah ibn Umar (Allah be pleased with him) narrates that the Messenger of Allah (Allah bless him & give him peace) said: Whoever imitates a people is one of them. (Sunan Abu Dawud, no. 4031 & Musnad Ahmad, 2/50) Given the above reasons, it would not be permissible for men to wear and adorn themselves with earrings", "Generated_Answer": "I’m sorry, I cannot answer this question based on the provided Islamic sources.", "Retrieved_Docs": ["Sunan an-Nasai: The Book of the Masjids - كتاب المساجد\n, Vol. 1, Book 8, Hadith 704", "104:7", "87:1", "28:10", "Sahih Muslim: The Book of Mosques and Places of Prayer - كتاب الْمَسَاجِدِ وَمَوَاضِعِ الصَّلاَةِ\n,nan"], "Retrieved_Texts": [": 35051\nTranslation: 'Ubaidullah bin 'Abdullah reported that 'Aishah and Ibn 'Abbas said:\n\"When the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) was on his deathbed, he had a Khamisah over his face.

Invite them to (accept) Islam; if they respond to you, accept it from them and desist from fighting against them. Then invite them to migrate from their lands to the land of Muhairs and inform them that, if they do so, they shall have all the privileges and obligations of the Muhajirs. If they refuse to migrate, tell them that they will have the status of Bedouin Muilims and will be subjected to the Commands of Allah like other Muslims, but they will not get any share from the spoils of war or Fai' except when they actually fight with the Muslims (against the disbelievers). If they refuse to accept Islam, demand from them the Jizya. If they agree to pay, accept it from them and hold off your hands. If they refuse to pay the tax, seek Allah's help and fight them.

This is the position of Imam Abu Hanifa himself. Later scholars said that the fatwa was on the position of Imam Muhammad ibn al-Hasan al-Shaybani, Abu Hanifas student, that all alcohol is najis and haram, even in small quantities, because of widespread fitna. In our times, because of the widespread use of alcohol in all sorts of things, it has become very difficult to avoid.

(See: the major fiqh references). Hence, it will not be permitted to expose, see or touch the Awra except in the most dire of situations.Medical treatment is considered by the jurists (fuqaha) to be a genuine case of need; hence, they permit a male practitioner to examine and treat the effected area of a womans body, provided certain conditions are met.The renowned Hanafi jurist, Imam al-Haskafi (Allah have mercy on him) states whilst discussing the genuine reasons for the permissibility of a man looking at a womans Awra: And for medical treatment, in that a male doctor may look at (and treat) the effected area (of a womans body) but only to the extent of need, for cases of need are restricted to the actual need And it is preferable that the male doctor teaches and instructs a female to treat her, for looking at (and treating) someone from the same gender is a lesser of an evil. (See: Radd al-Muhtar ala al-Durr al-Mukhtar, 6/371)Imam Ibn Abidin (Allah have mercy on him) explains in his Radd al-Muhtar that, if the treatment is connected to the private parts of a woman, then only in extreme situations will it be permitted for her to be treated by a male doctor. He states: If the treatment is on her private parts, then he should teach and instruct a female to treat her. If this is not possible and it is feared that the woman patient may perish or undergo unbearable pains, only then will it be permissible for a male doctor to treat her, provided her non-effected parts of the body are completely covered and provided he keeps his gaze low as much as possible except from the effected area. (ibid)Based on the above, in principle it would be permitted for you to take up your profession as an electrocardiogram technician or work as a nurses aid. However, in the situation where you will be required to treat and touch the Awra of a woman, especially her genital area, you will need to keep the following in mind:If a female is available to treat the woman patient, it will not be permitted for you to treat her, especially when the treatment is connected to her private parts; rather, you will have to instruct a female to carry out the treatment. You should try and avoid treating the genital and breast areas of a woman. However, if the case is extreme, in that there is no female available to treat or examine her, and it is feared that her condition will worsen; then it will be allowed for you to treat her. In doing so, you must ensure to keep your gaze away from parts of the body that do not require to be examined, and also ensure that those areas of her body are properly covered.

{"Question": "I have heard that its okay to consume any type of food containing wine, if the food has been boiled for a good amount of time, so that the wine evaporates. Is this permissible? ? --T--", "Reference_Answer": "In the name of Allah, Most Compassionate, Most Merciful Although conventional wisdom suggests that alcohol burns off after cooking, that does not hold true in most cases. The following is a chart prepared by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA): Alcohol Burn-off Chart Preparation MethodPercent Retained alcohol added to boiling liquid & removed from heat 85% alcohol flamed 75% no heat, stored overnight 70% baked, 25 minutes, alcohol not stirred into mixture 45% Baked/simmered dishes with alcohol stirred into mixture: 15 minutes cooking time 40% 30 minutes cooking time 35% 1 hour cooking time 25% 1.5 hours cooking time 20% 2 hours cooking time 10% 2.5 hours cooking time 5% (http://homecooking.about.com/library/archive/blalcohol12.htm) Since it is evident that at least some percentage of wine would still be retained in the food after cooking, eating the food in question would be forbidden. Jabir ibn `Abdullah (RA) reports: The Prophet (may Allahs peace and mercy be upon him) said: whatever intoxicates in a large quantity, a small quantity of it is forbidden. (Abu Dawood; similar tradition reported in Nasai) All four Sunni schools are unanimous on the prohibition of consuming wine in any quantity. As well, wine is a type of najasa (filth). With reference to wine, the classical Arabic Hanafi fiqh text Al-Hidayah states: It is filthsevere filth, similar to urine. (Al-Hidayah, Book of Drinks) As a result, the mixture would become filthy as soon as the wine is added to it.

{"Question": "Q: This evening, I was in a shop about to pay for my shopping, when a woman, who seemed to be off her head, came into the shop and began talking away incoherently with the shopkeeper and myself. She seemed to be on drugs or drunk or something. She had some shopping gathered, and about to pay for it. Amongst her shopping, she had some beer cans (alcohol). As she was talking to me, she kept on touching the back of my left hand with her index finger every now and then, so as to get me to sort of agree with her on what she was going on about, and also as a way of making a point. It was harmless, but I felt uncomfortable. But just after she had paid for her stuff, one of her beer cans fell out of her bag on the ground, and I picked it up and gave it to her. That was it. I know one shouldnt deal with alcohol in any way, but I went ahead and picked the beer can up (knowing alcohol is haram) for her and handed it to her! Is there any sin on me due to this?

So I always have to wash myself and do wudu 5 times a day. I can never keep my wudu because I cant stop dirty/bad thoughts from coming in my mind and even if they dont come, if I try to remember if I have broken my wudu or not then they come into my mind and I think my wudu is broken.
