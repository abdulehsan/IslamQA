", "Generated_Answer": "<think>\nOkay, so I have this situation where a family member ordered pizza from a takeaway that I don't trust. There's a rumor that their chicken might be dodgy, which could mean it's not halal. Anyway, one of the pizza slices touched my home-cooked food, and I ended up eating the roti that was touched. Now I'm worried if this makes my food haram because of that contact.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out if the pizza is definitely haram. The takeaway's chicken is questionable, but the pizza in question—does it have chicken? If it's a vegetarian pizza, maybe it's okay. But if it does have chicken, and the chicken isn't halal, then the pizza would be haram. So I should check what kind of pizza it was.\n\nAssuming the pizza has haram ingredients, like non-halal chicken, then the next step is understanding if contact with my food makes it haram. From what I remember, in Islamic law, if a haram substance comes into contact with food, it can make the food haram, but there are conditions. It depends on whether the substances actually mix and if there's a transfer of any impermissible substance.\n\nSo, if the pizza slice just touched my roti but didn't leave any residue or transfer any part of the pizza to the roti, maybe it's still okay. But if there was some sauce or cheese or something that got onto the roti, then that might be a problem. Also, the quantity matters. If it's a small amount, maybe it's negligible, but I'm not sure about the exact rules here.\n\nI should also consider the intention and the source. If the takeaway's food is haram, then even a small amount could affect the entire dish. But if it's just contact without any transfer, maybe it's not a big issue. I'm a bit confused about whether the mere touch without any transfer is enough to make it haram.\n\nI think I should look up some Islamic rulings on this. Maybe there's a principle about how substances can make other things haram upon contact. I recall something about liquids versus solids. If a haram liquid touches food, it can make it haram, but solids might be different. If the pizza is solid and just touches the roti without any moisture transfer, maybe it's not as severe.\n\nAlso, the concept of istihaalah comes into play, which is about transformation. If the haram substance"}
{"Question": "When you do ghusl and you have to make sure all your hair or skin is wet, does this mean that you have to maintain its wetness till the end of the ghusl? ? --T--", "Answer": "Assalamu alaykum Yes, one must indeed wash all of the hairs on ones body to the roots. One should be sure to avoid misgivings (waswasa) regarding this. Please look up baseless misgivings and doubts in the SunniPath archives (at www.SunniPath.com) in this regard. One is not obliged to perform the ritual bath (ghusl) in one sitting. The ghusl is valid as long as the entirety of ones body is washed, regardless of whether the whole body is wet by the end or whether some parts are dry and others wet. It is however a confirmed sunna to perform it from beginning to end without an unnecessarily prolonged delay", "Document": "It was narrated that Aishah said:\"When the Messenger of Allah () performed Ghusl from Janabah, he would wash his hands, then perform Wudu as for prayer, then he would perform Ghusl, then run his fingers through his hair to be sure that the water pour water over his head three times, then wash the rest of his body.\"<D>Narrated Abu Huraira:The Prophet (or Abul Qasim) said, \"While a man was walking, clad in a two-piece garment and proud of himself with his hair well-combed, suddenly Allah made him sink into the earth and he will go on sinking into it till the Day of Resurrection.<D>Narrated Hisham bin `Urwa:(on the authority of his father) `Aisha said, \"Whenever Allahs Apostle took the bath of Janaba, he cleaned his hands and performed ablution like that for prayer and then took a bath and rubbed his hair, till he felt that the whole skin of the head had become wet, then he would pour water thrice and wash the rest of the body.\" `Aisha further said, \"I and Allahs Apostle used to take a bath from a single water container, from which we took water simultaneously.\"<D>(Or (bethink thee) the like of him who, passing by a township) He says: do you not know about Uzayr Ibn Shurahya who passed by the township of Dayr Hiraql (which had fallen into utter ruin, exclaimed: How shall Allah give this township life after its death) How can Allah bring the people of this township back to life after their death? (So Allah made him die) right on the spot (a hundred years, then brought him back to life) at the end of the day. (He) Allah (said: How long hast thou tarried) O Uzayr?

Just look at thy food) figs and grapes (and drink) juice(which have not rotted! Look at thine ass!) look at the bones of your ass how white they look! (And, thatWe may make thee a token) a sign (to mankind) regarding the matter of bringing the dead to life, that they will be resurrected in the same state they died in, because Uzayr died young and was brought back to life as a young person. It is said that Allah made him a lesson for people, for he died when he was 40 years old and was brought back to life when his son was 120 years old, (look at the bones) the bones of your ass, (how We adjust them and then cover them with flesh!) after this. He then said: We will make grow on it nerves and veins, flesh, skin and hair and put the spirit in it.

The user is asking whether, when performing ghusl, one needs to ensure that all the hair or skin remains wet until the end of the ghusl. I'm not very familiar with Islamic rituals, so I need to break this down.\n\nFirst, I should recall what ghusl is. From what I remember, ghusl is a major ablution required in Islam for various reasons, like after intercourse, menstruation, or postpartum. It's a more thorough cleansing compared to wudu (which is the minor ablution). The purpose is to cleanse the entire body, both physically and spiritually.\n\nNow, the question is about maintaining wetness throughout the ghusl. I think the key here is understanding the process of ghusl. I believe ghusl involves washing the entire body, starting with the head and then moving to the rest of the body. The steps usually include rinsing the mouth, nose, washing the face, arms, then the entire body, ensuring that water reaches every part, including the hair.\n\nBut does that mean every part has to stay wet until the end? That seems a bit tricky because, practically, water tends to dry as you proceed, especially in parts that are exposed to air. So, maybe the requirement isn't about keeping everything wet the whole time, but rather ensuring that each part is washed thoroughly.\n\nI should consider the Islamic jurisprudence on this. Different scholars might have slightly different interpretations, but the general consensus, I think, is that as long as each part is washed with water once, it's sufficient. The wetness doesn't need to be maintained throughout the entire process. The important thing is that water reaches every part of the body, including under the hair, not necessarily that it stays wet until the very end.\n\nAlso, thinking about the practicality, if someone has long hair, it's hard to keep all strands wet until the end of ghusl. So, the emphasis is more on ensuring that water is applied to all parts rather than maintaining wetness. Once a part is washed, it's acceptable if it dries while washing other parts.\n\nI should also think about the intention (niyyah) behind the ghusl. The intention is to purify oneself, and as long as that intention is there and the actions follow the proper steps, the ghusl should be valid even if some parts dry afterward.\n\nMoreover, considering that"}
{"Question": "I am currently working as an Assistant Manager in a cinema. Im finding it very hard to protect my Islam and good character in this job. There is free mixing, alcohol is sold, I am frequently locked in a room with a women  during end of day cash reconciliation and the hours (shift work) make it very hard for me to pray. The reason I took this job was so that my parents could stop working. Al-Hamdo- Lillah I was able to take the burden of work off my Dad. Prior to my getting this job his health had been deteriorating rapidly  he has high blood pressure (he was a bus driver). Soon he will go to Pakistan and stay there for a while  something which I hope will be better for his health and his Islam. At my current cinema I am treated very badly by my boss. However I will soon move to another cinema where Im hoping it will be easier for me to protect myself  most cinemas have a majority of male supervisors and my boss may be more lenient. However there will still be alcohol and the hours will still be long. I currently pray at work  this is very difficult as I have to be available all the time throughout my shift. Things will be easier if I stop doing this and read Kaza when I get home  something which my family are putting pressure on me about. Is there any way I can justify doing this? I dont want to leave because then my Dad will have to start work again in which case his Islam and his health will suffer. Is it ok if I stay in this job until I find a new one  bearing in mind the economic situation and the fact that while working I dont have much time for job seeking. Also it is very difficult to find a truly Halal job in a non-Muslim country  I may be unemployed for years if I leave. Im feeling very trapped ? --T--", "Answer": "Assalamu alaykum, Dear brother, You have to understand that Allah MOST HIGH is the provider and sustainer. Engaging in haram activities to earn rizq deprives that rizq of barakah. You must try to find a new job immediately. Serving alcohol, or being associated with it in any way is haraam. According to a hadith, all of the people associate with alcohol are cursed by Allah MOST HIGH.Narrated Jabir bin Abdullah: I heard Allahs Messenger, in the year of the Conquest of Mecca, saying, Allah and His Messenger made illegal the trade of alcohol, dead animals, pigs and idols. The people asked, O Allahs Messenger! What about the fat of dead animals, for it was used for greasing the boats and the hides; and people use it for lights? He said, No, it is illegal. Allahs Messenger further said, May Allah curse the Jews, for Allah made the fat (of animals) illegal for them, yet they melted the fat and sold it and ate its price.Ibn Abbas (Allah be pleased with him) reported: This news reached Umar that Samura had sold wine, whereupon he said: May Allah destroy Samura; does he not know that Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: Let there be the curse of Allah upon the Jews that fat was declared forbidden for them, but they melted it and then sold it?>From the way that you write, it seems that you are from England. I do know that in England there is a very good social security system that helps unemployed people. If this is not the case, continue to work there until you find more work, then leave the job.

During a Ghazwa of his, he drew lots amongst us and the lot fell upon me, and I proceeded with him after Allah had decreed the use of the veil by women. I was carried in a Howdah (on the camel) and dismounted while still in it. When Allahs Apostle was through with his Ghazwa and returned home, and we approached the city of Medina, Allahs Apostle ordered us to proceed at night. When the order of setting off was given, I walked till I was past the army to answer the call of nature. After finishing I returned (to the camp) to depart (with the others) and suddenly realized that my necklace over my chest was missing. So, I returned to look for it and was delayed because of that. The people who used to carry me on the camel, came to my Howdah and put it on the back of the camel, thinking that I was in it, as, at that time, women were light in weight, and thin and lean, and did not use to eat much. So, those people did not feel the difference in the heaviness of the Howdah while lifting it, and they put it over the camel. At that time I was a young lady. They set the camel moving and proceeded on. I found my necklace after the army had gone, and came to their camp to find nobody. So, I went to the place where I used to stay, thinking that they would discover my absence and come back in my search. While in that state, I felt sleepy and slept. Safwan bin Muattal As-Sulami Adh-Dhakwani was behind the army and reached my abode in the morning. When he saw a sleeping person, he came to me, and he used to see me before veiling. So, I got up when I heard him saying, \"Inna lil-lah-wa inn a ilaihi rajiun (We are for Allah, and we will return to Him).\" He made his camel knell down. He got down from his camel, and put his leg on the front legs of the camel and then I rode and sat over it. Safwan set out walking, leading the camel by the rope till we reached the army who had halted to take rest at midday. Then whoever was meant for destruction, fell into destruction, (some people accused me falsely) and the leader of the false accusers was `Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul. After that we returned to Medina, and I became ill for one month while the people were spreading the forged statements of the false accusers. I was feeling during my ailment as if I were not receiving the usual kindness from the Prophet which I used to receive from him when I got sick. But he would come, greet and say, How is that (girl)? I did not know anything of what was going on till I recovered from my ailment and went out with Um Mistah to the Manasi where we used to answer the call of nature, and we used not to go to answer the call of nature except from night to night and that was before we had lavatories near to our houses. And this habit of ours was similar to the habit of the old Arabs in the open country (or away from houses). So. I and Um Mistah bint Ruhm went out walking. Um Mistah stumbled because of her long dress and on that she said, Let Mistah be ruined. I said, You are saying a bad word. Why are you abusing a man who took part in (the battle of) Badr? She said, O Hanata (you there) didnt you hear what they said? Then she told me the rumors of the false accusers. My sickness was aggravated, and when I returned home, Allahs Apostle came to me, and after greeting he said, How is that (girl)? I requested him to allow me to go to my parents. I wanted then to be sure of the news through them I Allahs Apostle allowed me, and I went to my parents and asked my mother, What are the people talking about? She said, O my daughter! Dont worry much about this matter. By Allah, never is there a charming woman loved by her husband who has other wives, but the women would forge false news about her. I said, Glorified be Allah! Are the people really taking of this matter? That night I kept on weeping and could not sleep till morning. In the morning Allahs Apostle called `Ali bin Abu Talib and Usama bin Zaid when he saw the Divine Inspiration delayed, to consul them about divorcing his wife (i.e. `Aisha). Usama bin Zaid said what he knew of the good reputation of his wives and added, O Allahs Apostle! Keep you wife, for, by Allah, we know nothing about her but good. `Ali bin Abu Talib said, O Allahs Apostle! Allah has no imposed restrictions on you, and there are many women other than she, yet you may ask the woman-servant who will tell you the truth. On that Allahs Apostle called Buraira and said, O Burair. Did you ever see anything which roused your suspicions about her? Buraira said, No, by Allah Who has sent you with the Truth, I have never seen in her anything faulty except that she is a girl of immature age, who sometimes sleeps and leaves the dough for the goats to eat. On that day Allahs Apostle ascended the pulpit and requested that somebody support him in punishing `Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul. Allahs Apostle said, Who will support me to punish that person (`Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul) who has hurt me by slandering the reputation of my family? By Allah, I know nothing about my family but good, and they have accused a person about whom I know nothing except good, and he never entered my house except in my company. Sa`d bin Mu`adh got up and said, O Allahs Apostle! by Allah, I will relieve you from him. If that man is from the tribe of the Aus, then we will chop his head off, and if he is from our brothers, the Khazraj, then order us, and we will fulfill your order. On that Sa`d bin Ubada, the chief of the Khazraj and before this incident, he had been a pious man, got up, motivated by his zeal for his tribe and said, By Allah, you have told a lie; you cannot kill him, and you will never be able to kill him. On that Usaid bin Al-Hadir got up and said (to Sa`d bin Ubada), By Allah! you are a liar. By Allah, we will kill him; and you are a hypocrite, defending the hypocrites. On this the two tribes of Aus and Khazraj got excited and were about to fight each other, while Allahs Apostle was standing on the pulpit. He got down and quieted them till they became silent and he kept quiet. On that day I kept on weeping so much so that neither did my tears stop, nor could I sleep. In the morning my parents were with me and I had wept for two nights and a day, till I thought my liver would burst from weeping. While they were sitting with me and I was weeping, an Ansari woman asked my permission to enter, and I allowed her to come in. She sat down and started weeping with me. While we were in this state, Allahs Apostle came and sat down and he had never sat with me since the day they forged the accusation. No revelation regarding my case came to him for a month. He recited Tashah-hud (i.e. None has the right to be worshipped but Allah and Muhammad is His Apostle) and then said, O `Aisha! I have been informed such-and-such about you; if you are innocent, then Allah will soon reveal your innocence, and if you have committed a sin, then repent to Allah and ask Him to forgive you, for when a person confesses his sin and asks Allah for forgiveness, Allah accepts his repentance. When Allahs Apostle finished his speech my tears ceased completely and there remained not even a single drop of it. I requested my father to reply to Allahs Apostle on my behalf. My father said, By Allah, I do not know what to say to Allahs Apostle. I said to my mother, Talk to Allahs Apostle on my behalf. She said, By Allah, I do not know what to say to Allahs Apostle. I was a young girl and did not have much knowledge of the Quran. I said. I know, by Allah, that you have listened to what people are saying and that has been planted in your minds and you have taken it as a truth. Now, if I told you that I am innocent and Allah knows that I am innocent, you would not believe me and if I confessed to you falsely that I am guilty, and Allah knows that I am innocent you would believe me. By Allah, I dont compare my situation with you except to the situation of Josephs father (i.e. Jacob) who said, So (for me) patience is most fitting against that which you assert and it is Allah (Alone) whose help can be sought. Then I turned to the other side of my bed hoping that Allah would prove my innocence. By Allah I never thought that Allah would reveal Divine Inspiration in my case, as I considered myself too inferior to be talked of in the Holy Quran. I had hoped that Allahs Apostle might have a dream in which Allah would prove my innocence. By Allah, Allahs Apostle had not got up and nobody had left the house before the Divine Inspiration came to Allahs Apostle. So, there overtook him the same state which used to overtake him, (when he used to have, on being inspired divinely). He was sweating so much so that the drops of the sweat were dropping like pearls though it was a (cold) wintry day. When that state of Allahs Apostle was over, he was smiling and the first word he said, `Aisha! Thank Allah, for Allah has declared your innocence. My mother told me to go to Allahs Apostle . I replied, By Allah I will not go to him and will not thank but Allah. So Allah revealed: \"Verily! They who spread the slander are a gang among you . . .\" (24.11) When Allah gave the declaration of my Innocence, Abu Bakr, who used to provide for Mistah bin Uthatha for he was his relative, said, By Allah, I will never provide Mistah with anything because of what he said about Aisha. But Allah later revealed: -- \"And let not those who are good and wealthy among you swear not to help their kinsmen, those in need and those who left their homes in Allahs Cause. Let them forgive and overlook. Do you not wish that Allah should forgive you? Verily! Allah is Oft-forgiving, Most Merciful.\" (24.22) After that Abu Bakr said, Yes ! By Allah! I like that Allah should forgive me, and resumed helping Mistah whom he used to help before. Allahs Apostle also asked Zainab bint Jahsh (i.e. the Prophets wife about me saying, What do you know and what did you see? She replied, O Allahs Apostle! I refrain to claim hearing or seeing what I have not heard or seen. By Allah, I know nothing except goodness about Aisha.\" Aisha further added \"Zainab was competing with me (in her beauty and the Prophets love), yet Allah protected her (from being malicious), for she had piety.\"<D>Narrated Sa`id bin Jubair:I said to Ibn `Abbas, \"Nauf Al-Bukah claims that Moses, the companion of Al-Khadir was not Moses (the prophet) of the children of Israel, but some other Moses.\" Ibn `Abbas said, \"Allahs enemy (i.e. Nauf) has told a lie. Ubai bin Ka`b told us that the Prophet said, Once Moses stood up and addressed Bani Israel. He was asked who was the most learned man amongst the people. He said, I. Allah admonished him as he did not attribute absolute knowledge to Him (Allah). So, Allah said to him, Yes, at the junction of the two seas there is a Slave of Mine who is more learned than you. Moses said, O my Lord! How can I meet him? Allah said, Take a fish and put it in a large basket and you will find him at the place where you will lose the fish. Moses took a fish and put it in a basket and proceeded along with his (servant) boy, Yusha` bin Noon, till they reached the rock where they laid their heads (i.e. lay down). Moses slept, and the fish, moving out of the basket, fell into the sea. It took its way into the sea (straight) as in a tunnel. Allah stopped the flow of water over the fish and it became like an arch (the Prophet pointed out this arch with his hands). They travelled the rest of the night, and the next day Moses said to his boy (servant), Give us our food, for indeed, we have suffered much fatigue in this journey of ours. Moses did not feel tired till he crossed that place which Allah had ordered him to seek after. His boy (servant) said to him, Do you know that when we were sitting near that rock, I forgot the fish, and none but Satan caused me to forget to tell (you) about it, and it took its course into the sea in an amazing way?. So there was a path for the fish and that astonished them. Moses said, That was what we were seeking after. So, both of them retraced their footsteps till they reached the rock. There they saw a man Lying covered with a garment. Moses greeted him and he replied saying, How do people greet each other in your land? Moses said, I am Moses. The man asked, Moses of Bani Israel? Moses said, Yes, I have come to you so that you may teach me from those things which Allah has taught you. He said, O Moses! I have some of the Knowledge of Allah which Allah has taught me, and which you do not know, while you have some of the Knowledge of Allah which Allah has taught you and which I do not know. Moses asked, May I follow you? He said, But you will not be able to remain patient with me for how can you be patient about things which you will not be able to understand? (Moses said, You will find me, if Allah so will, truly patient, and I will not disobey you in aught.) So, both of them set out walking along the sea-shore, a boat passed by them and they asked the crew of the boat to take them on board. The crew recognized Al-Khadir and so they took them on board without fare. When they were on board the boat, a sparrow came and stood on the edge of the boat and dipped its beak once or twice into the sea. Al-Khadir said to Moses, O Moses! My knowledge and your knowledge have not decreased Allahs Knowledge except as much as this sparrow has decreased the water of the sea with its beak. Then suddenly Al-Khadir took an adze and plucked a plank, and Moses did not notice it till he had plucked a plank with the adze. Moses said to him, What have you done? They took us on board charging us nothing; yet you I have intentionally made a hole in their boat so as to drown its passengers. Verily, you have done a dreadful thing. Al-Khadir replied, Did I not tell you that you would not be able to remain patient with me? Moses replied, Do not blame me for what I have forgotten, and do not be hard upon me for my fault. So the first excuse of Moses was that he had forgotten. When they had left the sea, they passed by a boy playing with other boys. Al-Khadir took hold of the boys head and plucked it with his hand like this. (Sufyan, the sub narrator pointed with his fingertips as if he was plucking some fruit.) Moses said to him, \"Have you killed an innocent person who has not killed any person? You have really done a horrible thing.\" Al-Khadir said, \"Did I not tell you that you could not remain patient with me? Moses said \"If I ask you about anything after this, dont accompany me. You have received an excuse from me. Then both of them went on till they came to some people of a village, and they asked its inhabitant for wood but they refused to entertain them as guests. Then they saw therein a wall which was just going to collapse (and Al Khadir repaired it just by touching it with his hands). (Sufyan, the sub-narrator, pointed with his hands, illustrating how Al-Khadir passed his hands over the wall upwards.) Moses said, \"These are the people whom we have called on, but they neither gave us food, nor entertained us as guests, yet you have repaired their wall. If you had wished, you could have taken wages for it.\" Al-Khadir said, \"This is the parting between you and me, and I shall tell you the explanation of those things on which you could not remain patient.\" The Prophet added, \"We wished that Moses could have remained patient by virtue of which Allah might have told us more about their story. (Sufyan the sub-narrator said that the Prophet said, \"May Allah bestow His Mercy on Moses! If he had remained patient, we would have been told further about their case.\")<D>Sa, id b. jubair reported that it was said to Ibn Abbas that Nauf al-Bikali was of the opinion that Moses who went in search of knowledge was not the Moses of Bani Israil. He said:Said, did you hear it from him? I said: Yes. Thereupon he said that Nauf had not stated the fact. Ubayy b. Kab narrated to us that he had heard Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: Moses had been delivering sermons to his people. And he made this remark: No person upon the earth has better knowledge than I or nothing better than mine. Thereupon Allah revealed to him: I know one who is better than you (in knowledge) or there is a person on the earth having more knowledge than you. Thereupon he said: My Lord, direct me to him. It was said to him: Keep a salted fish as a provision for journey. The place where that fish would be lost (there you will find that man). So he set forth and a young slave along with him until they came to a place Sakhra. but he did not find any clue. So he proceeded on and left that young man there. The fish began to stir in water and the water assumed the form of an ark over the fish. The young man said: I should meet Allahs Apostle (peace be upon him) and inform him, but he was made to forget and when they had gone beyond that place, he (Moses) said to the young man: Bring breakfast. We have been exhausted because of the journey, and he (Moses) was not exhausted until he had crossed that (particular) place (where he had) to meet Khadir, and the youth was reminded and said: Did you not see that as we reached Sakhra I forgot the fish and it is satan alone who has made me forgetful of it? It is strange that he has been able to find way in the ocean too. He said: This is what we sought for us. They returned retracing their steps, and he (his companion) pointed to him the location (where) the fish (had been lost). Moses began to search him there. He suddenly saw Khadir wrapped in a cloth and lying on his back. He said to him: As-Salamu-Alaikum. He removed the cloth from his face and said: Wa Alaikum-us-Salam! Who are you? He said: I am Moses. He said: Who Moses? He said: Moses Of Bani Israil. He said: What brought you here? He said: I have come so that you may teach me what you have been taught of righteousness. He said: You shall have to bear with me, and how can you have patience about a thing of which you have no comprehensive knowledge? You will not have patience when you see me doing a thing I have been ordered to do. He said: If Allah pleases, you will find me patient, nor shall I disobey you in aught. Khadir said: If you follow me, dont ask me about anything until I explain it to you. So they went on until they embarked upon a boat. He (Khadir) made a hole in that. Thereupon he (Moses) said: You have done this so that you may drown the persons sitting in the boat. You have done something grievous. Thereupon he said: Did I not tell you that you will not be able to bear with me? Thereupon he (Moses) said: Blame me not for what I forgot and be not hard upon me for what I did. (Khadir gave him another chance.) So they went on until they reached a place where boys were playing. He went to one of them and caught holdof one (apparently) at random and killed him. Moses (peace be upon him) felt agitated and said: You have killed an innocent person not guilty of slaying another. You have done something aboininable. Thereupon Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: May Allah have mercy upon us and Moses. Had he shown patience he would have seen wonderful things, but fear of blame, with respect to his companion, seized him and he said: If I ask anything after this, keep not company with me. You will then have a valid excuse in my case, and had he (Moses) shown patience he would have seen many wonderful things. He (the narrator) said: Whenever he (the Holy Prophet) made mention of any Prophet, he always said: May there be mercy of Allah upon us and upon my brother so and so. They, however, proceeded on until they came to the inhabitants of a village who were very miserly. They went to the meeting places and asked for hospitality but they refused to show any hospitality to them. They both found in that village a wall which was about to fall. He (Khadir) set it right. Thereupon he (Moses) said: If you so liked. you could get wages for it. Thereupon he said: This is the partince, of ways between me and you, and, taking hold of his cloth, he said: Now I will explain to you the real significance (of all these acts) for which you could not show patience. As for the boat, it belonged to the poor people working on the river and I intended to damage it for there was ahead of them (a king) who seized boats by force. (When he came) to catch hold of it he found it a damaged boat, so he spared it (and later on) it was set right with wood. So far as the boy is concerned, he has been, by very nature, an unbeliever, whereas his parents loved him very much. Had he grown up he would have involved them in wrongdoing and unbelief, so we wished that their Lord should give them in its place one better in purity and close to mercy.

They're facing a lot of challenges in maintaining their Islamic values and good character in this job. Let me break down their situation step by step to understand better.\n\nFirst, they mentioned free mixing, which I know refers to mixing between men and women in a way that's not permissible in Islam. They also sell alcohol, which is another issue because Islam prohibits the consumption and sale of alcohol. Additionally, they're often locked in a room with a woman during end-of-day cash reconciliation, which could lead to situations that are haram or at least not advisable.\n\nTheir work hours are shift-based, making it hard to pray on time. They took the job to support their parents, specifically their dad, who was a bus driver with high blood pressure. Their father's health was deteriorating, so taking this job helped alleviate his burden. Now, the dad is moving to Pakistan, which might be better for his health and religion. However, at the current job, the person is treated badly by their boss, but they're moving to another cinema soon where they hope things will be better, with more male supervisors and a more lenient boss. Still, the issues of alcohol and long hours remain.\n\nThey're currently trying to pray at work, which is tough because they need to be available all the time. Their family is suggesting they stop praying at work and instead read Kaza (make up the prayers) at home. They're feeling pressured about this and are asking if it's justifiable. They don't want to quit because their dad might have to start working again, which could harm his health and religion. They feel trapped because finding a halal job in a non-Muslim country is difficult, and they might end up unemployed for years.\n\nSo, the main issues here are:\n\n1. Maintaining Islamic practices in a challenging work environment.\n2. Balancing the responsibility of providing for their family with their religious obligations.\n3. The pressure from family regarding prayer times.\n4. The difficulty in finding alternative employment that aligns with Islamic values.\n\nI need to address each of these points with Islamic teachings and practical advice.\n\nStarting with the first point, working in an environment where there's free mixing and alcohol is problematic. Islam teaches that Muslims should avoid situations that could lead to temptation or sin. However, the person's intention was good—to support their family. The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) emphasized the importance of intending good"}

I'm not entirely sure about the Islamic rules regarding this, so I need to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that in Islam, there are certain guidelines about how the deceased should be treated. For Muslims, the body is washed, wrapped in a shroud, and then buried. Coffins aren't traditionally used in Muslim funerals, but I think they might be used in some cultures or circumstances. So, maybe selling coffins isn't prohibited, but it depends on how they're used.\n\nI also recall that in Islam, the concept of \"halal\" and \"haram\" applies to actions and products. So, selling something that's inherently harmful or promotes something haram would be a problem. But coffins themselves are just boxes for burial, so they don't seem inherently haram.\n\nNow, considering selling to Muslims: if a Muslim is selling coffins to other Muslims, the primary concern would be whether this practice aligns with Islamic burial practices. If the coffin is used in a way that's acceptable, like placing it in the ground without any adornment that's against Islamic teachings, then it might be permissible. However, if the coffin use goes against Islamic traditions, maybe it's not allowed.\n\nAs for selling to non-Muslims, I think it's more straightforward because non-Muslims have their own burial practices, and selling coffins to them wouldn't interfere with Islamic rituals. It's a business transaction where the product is being used according to the buyer's customs, which don't necessarily have to align with Islamic practices.\n\nI should also think about the intention behind selling the coffins. If the seller's intention is to provide a necessary service and earn a living in a lawful way, that's positive. But if the coffins are being sold in a way that promotes something haram, like extravagant or wasteful spending, that could be an issue.\n\nAdditionally, I remember something about not engaging in transactions that involve haram items, like pork or alcohol. Since coffins aren't haram, this doesn't apply here. So, the sale itself isn't problematic in that sense.\n\nI also wonder if there are any specific Islamic juristic opinions on this. Maybe scholars have discussed whether selling coffins is permissible. From what I can recall, as long as the product is used correctly and doesn't go against Islamic principles, it should be allowed."}
{"Question": "Q: I have waswasahs, and alhamdulillaah I am doing better now in my salah after listening to the advice, but I still have problems with wudoo and I have an issue now about dead skin which I will elaborate about in shaa Allaah. OK so I used a pummelstone on my feet and I had dead skin on my feet then I wore my slippers and performed Wudoo washing my feet under the tap properly and then put my slippers back on and took them off to do salah. After salah I see flakes of dead skin on my feet so I look in my slipper and still see the dead skin from before inside of them so, I have 2 questions: 1. The amount of dead skin was considerable and I am doubtful and irritated by not knowing where it came from for sure. 2.

They've been working on their salah (prayers) and are now focusing on their wudoo (ablution). They mentioned using a pumice stone on their feet, which removes dead skin, and then wearing slippers. After doing wudoo, they noticed dead skin flakes on their feet and in their slippers, which is causing them some distress and doubt.\n\nThey have two main questions: first, about the origin of the dead skin they're seeing, and second, whether the water they used in wudoo was enough to penetrate through the dead skin to cleanse their feet properly.\n\nI need to break this down. First, understanding their situation. They used a pumice stone, which is common for removing dead skin. Then they wore slippers, did wudoo by washing their feet under the tap, and then prayed. After prayer, they saw dead skin again, both on their feet and in their slippers.\n\nFor the first question, they're concerned about where this dead skin is coming from. They're worried that maybe their wudoo wasn't valid because the dead skin might have come from somewhere else or wasn't properly washed away. They're feeling doubtful and irritated by this uncertainty.\n\nFor the second question, they're questioning whether the amount of water they used, along with rubbing, was sufficient to ensure that the water reached the live skin under the dead layers. They might be worried that their wudoo was incomplete or invalid because the water didn't penetrate properly.\n\nI should address each concern step by step. Starting with the first question about the dead skin's origin. It's possible that the dead skin came from their own feet, especially since they used a pumice stone before. Even after washing, some dead skin might remain, especially if it's a large area or deeply embedded. It's also possible that the slippers could have some dead skin from before, which wasn't entirely removed when they washed their feet.\n\nRegarding the second question, the key point is whether the water used in wudoo was sufficient. In Islamic jurisprudence, as long as one washes the feet thoroughly, even with dead skin present, the wudoo is valid. The requirement is to wash the outer layer; the dead skin doesn't necessarily prevent the water from reaching the live skin unless it's a thick,"}

During a Ghazwa of his, he drew lots amongst us and the lot fell upon me, and I proceeded with him after Allah had decreed the use of the veil by women. I was carried in a Howdah (on the camel) and dismounted while still in it. When Allahs Apostle was through with his Ghazwa and returned home, and we approached the city of Medina, Allahs Apostle ordered us to proceed at night. When the order of setting off was given, I walked till I was past the army to answer the call of nature. After finishing I returned (to the camp) to depart (with the others) and suddenly realized that my necklace over my chest was missing. So, I returned to look for it and was delayed because of that. The people who used to carry me on the camel, came to my Howdah and put it on the back of the camel, thinking that I was in it, as, at that time, women were light in weight, and thin and lean, and did not use to eat much. So, those people did not feel the difference in the heaviness of the Howdah while lifting it, and they put it over the camel. At that time I was a young lady. They set the camel moving and proceeded on. I found my necklace after the army had gone, and came to their camp to find nobody. So, I went to the place where I used to stay, thinking that they would discover my absence and come back in my search. While in that state, I felt sleepy and slept. Safwan bin Muattal As-Sulami Adh-Dhakwani was behind the army and reached my abode in the morning. When he saw a sleeping person, he came to me, and he used to see me before veiling. So, I got up when I heard him saying, \"Inna lil-lah-wa inn a ilaihi rajiun (We are for Allah, and we will return to Him).\" He made his camel knell down. He got down from his camel, and put his leg on the front legs of the camel and then I rode and sat over it. Safwan set out walking, leading the camel by the rope till we reached the army who had halted to take rest at midday. Then whoever was meant for destruction, fell into destruction, (some people accused me falsely) and the leader of the false accusers was `Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul. After that we returned to Medina, and I became ill for one month while the people were spreading the forged statements of the false accusers. I was feeling during my ailment as if I were not receiving the usual kindness from the Prophet which I used to receive from him when I got sick. But he would come, greet and say, How is that (girl)? I did not know anything of what was going on till I recovered from my ailment and went out with Um Mistah to the Manasi where we used to answer the call of nature, and we used not to go to answer the call of nature except from night to night and that was before we had lavatories near to our houses. And this habit of ours was similar to the habit of the old Arabs in the open country (or away from houses). So. I and Um Mistah bint Ruhm went out walking. Um Mistah stumbled because of her long dress and on that she said, Let Mistah be ruined. I said, You are saying a bad word. Why are you abusing a man who took part in (the battle of) Badr? She said, O Hanata (you there) didnt you hear what they said? Then she told me the rumors of the false accusers. My sickness was aggravated, and when I returned home, Allahs Apostle came to me, and after greeting he said, How is that (girl)? I requested him to allow me to go to my parents. I wanted then to be sure of the news through them I Allahs Apostle allowed me, and I went to my parents and asked my mother, What are the people talking about? She said, O my daughter! Dont worry much about this matter. By Allah, never is there a charming woman loved by her husband who has other wives, but the women would forge false news about her. I said, Glorified be Allah! Are the people really taking of this matter? That night I kept on weeping and could not sleep till morning. In the morning Allahs Apostle called `Ali bin Abu Talib and Usama bin Zaid when he saw the Divine Inspiration delayed, to consul them about divorcing his wife (i.e. `Aisha). Usama bin Zaid said what he knew of the good reputation of his wives and added, O Allahs Apostle! Keep you wife, for, by Allah, we know nothing about her but good. `Ali bin Abu Talib said, O Allahs Apostle! Allah has no imposed restrictions on you, and there are many women other than she, yet you may ask the woman-servant who will tell you the truth. On that Allahs Apostle called Buraira and said, O Burair. Did you ever see anything which roused your suspicions about her? Buraira said, No, by Allah Who has sent you with the Truth, I have never seen in her anything faulty except that she is a girl of immature age, who sometimes sleeps and leaves the dough for the goats to eat. On that day Allahs Apostle ascended the pulpit and requested that somebody support him in punishing `Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul. Allahs Apostle said, Who will support me to punish that person (`Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul) who has hurt me by slandering the reputation of my family? By Allah, I know nothing about my family but good, and they have accused a person about whom I know nothing except good, and he never entered my house except in my company. Sa`d bin Mu`adh got up and said, O Allahs Apostle! by Allah, I will relieve you from him. If that man is from the tribe of the Aus, then we will chop his head off, and if he is from our brothers, the Khazraj, then order us, and we will fulfill your order. On that Sa`d bin Ubada, the chief of the Khazraj and before this incident, he had been a pious man, got up, motivated by his zeal for his tribe and said, By Allah, you have told a lie; you cannot kill him, and you will never be able to kill him. On that Usaid bin Al-Hadir got up and said (to Sa`d bin Ubada), By Allah! you are a liar. By Allah, we will kill him; and you are a hypocrite, defending the hypocrites. On this the two tribes of Aus and Khazraj got excited and were about to fight each other, while Allahs Apostle was standing on the pulpit. He got down and quieted them till they became silent and he kept quiet. On that day I kept on weeping so much so that neither did my tears stop, nor could I sleep. In the morning my parents were with me and I had wept for two nights and a day, till I thought my liver would burst from weeping. While they were sitting with me and I was weeping, an Ansari woman asked my permission to enter, and I allowed her to come in. She sat down and started weeping with me. While we were in this state, Allahs Apostle came and sat down and he had never sat with me since the day they forged the accusation. No revelation regarding my case came to him for a month. He recited Tashah-hud (i.e. None has the right to be worshipped but Allah and Muhammad is His Apostle) and then said, O `Aisha! I have been informed such-and-such about you; if you are innocent, then Allah will soon reveal your innocence, and if you have committed a sin, then repent to Allah and ask Him to forgive you, for when a person confesses his sin and asks Allah for forgiveness, Allah accepts his repentance. When Allahs Apostle finished his speech my tears ceased completely and there remained not even a single drop of it. I requested my father to reply to Allahs Apostle on my behalf. My father said, By Allah, I do not know what to say to Allahs Apostle. I said to my mother, Talk to Allahs Apostle on my behalf. She said, By Allah, I do not know what to say to Allahs Apostle. I was a young girl and did not have much knowledge of the Quran. I said. I know, by Allah, that you have listened to what people are saying and that has been planted in your minds and you have taken it as a truth. Now, if I told you that I am innocent and Allah knows that I am innocent, you would not believe me and if I confessed to you falsely that I am guilty, and Allah knows that I am innocent you would believe me. By Allah, I dont compare my situation with you except to the situation of Josephs father (i.e. Jacob) who said, So (for me) patience is most fitting against that which you assert and it is Allah (Alone) whose help can be sought. Then I turned to the other side of my bed hoping that Allah would prove my innocence. By Allah I never thought that Allah would reveal Divine Inspiration in my case, as I considered myself too inferior to be talked of in the Holy Quran. I had hoped that Allahs Apostle might have a dream in which Allah would prove my innocence. By Allah, Allahs Apostle had not got up and nobody had left the house before the Divine Inspiration came to Allahs Apostle. So, there overtook him the same state which used to overtake him, (when he used to have, on being inspired divinely). He was sweating so much so that the drops of the sweat were dropping like pearls though it was a (cold) wintry day. When that state of Allahs Apostle was over, he was smiling and the first word he said, `Aisha! Thank Allah, for Allah has declared your innocence. My mother told me to go to Allahs Apostle . I replied, By Allah I will not go to him and will not thank but Allah. So Allah revealed: \"Verily! They who spread the slander are a gang among you . . .\" (24.11) When Allah gave the declaration of my Innocence, Abu Bakr, who used to provide for Mistah bin Uthatha for he was his relative, said, By Allah, I will never provide Mistah with anything because of what he said about Aisha. But Allah later revealed: -- \"And let not those who are good and wealthy among you swear not to help their kinsmen, those in need and those who left their homes in Allahs Cause. Let them forgive and overlook. Do you not wish that Allah should forgive you? Verily! Allah is Oft-forgiving, Most Merciful.\" (24.22) After that Abu Bakr said, Yes ! By Allah! I like that Allah should forgive me, and resumed helping Mistah whom he used to help before. Allahs Apostle also asked Zainab bint Jahsh (i.e. the Prophets wife about me saying, What do you know and what did you see? She replied, O Allahs Apostle! I refrain to claim hearing or seeing what I have not heard or seen. By Allah, I know nothing except goodness about Aisha.\" Aisha further added \"Zainab was competing with me (in her beauty and the Prophets love), yet Allah protected her (from being malicious), for she had piety.\"<D>Narrated Anas:The Prophet said, \"Whoever slaughtered the sacrifice before the `Id prayer, should repeat it (slaughter another one).\" A man said \"This is the day on which meat is desired.\" Then he mentioned the need of his neighbors (for meat) and the Prophet seemed to accept his excuse. The man said, \"I have a Jadhaa which is to me better than two sheep.\" The Prophet allowed him (to slaughter it as a sacrifice). But I do not know whether this permission was general for all Muslims or not. The Prophet then went towards two rams and slaughtered them, and the people went towards their sheep and slaughtered them.<D>(And thou) O Muhammad! (wilt find them) the Jews (greediest of mankind for any life) to remain in this world (and (greedier) than the idolaters) even greedier than the Arab idolaters.

Then the following was revealed about Abdullah Ibn Ubayy and his host because they used to force their female slaves to commit adultery in order to earn money from them and have more slaves as result of the children they bore as a consequence, and so Allah forbade them from doing this and made such an act forbidden: (Force not your slave girls to whoredom that ye may seek enjoyment of the life of the world) from what they earn from working as prostitutes and also from the children they give birth to, (if they would preserve their chastity) if they want to remain chaste. (And if one force them) and if one force these slave girl to commit adultery, (then (unto them), after their compulsion) and repentance, (Lo!

I bought four pairs but only realized the material after wearing them. I'm not sure if this is permissible, so I want to figure it out.\n\nFirst, I remember that in Islam, there are rules about what materials Muslims can wear. I think silk is generally not allowed for men. Let me check that. I believe the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) prohibited men from wearing silk because it's considered a luxury and not appropriate for men. So that's probably why the user is concerned.\n\nBut wait, the pants here only have 10% silk. Does that make a difference? I'm not sure. Maybe if it's a small percentage, it's still not allowed because any amount of silk is prohibited. Or maybe if it's mixed with other materials, it's okay. I'm not certain about this.\n\nAlso, there's the issue of dyes and other materials. If the fabric was dyed using prohibited substances, that could be a problem. But the user didn't mention anything about the dye, so maybe that's not the case here.\n\nAnother point is the concept of 'ishah, which means doubt. If there's uncertainty about whether something is permissible, it's better to avoid it. The user seems cautious and wants to avoid doubt, which is commendable.\n\nSo, putting this together: Silk is prohibited for men, even in small amounts. Therefore, the pants with 10% silk wouldn't be allowed. The other materials, wool and cashmere, are permissible. But since the pants contain silk, they're not suitable for the user.\n\nI should also consider if there's any exception or different opinion. Maybe some scholars have a different view, but from what I know, the general consensus is that silk is prohibited for men regardless of the amount. Therefore, it's best for the user to avoid wearing these pants.\n\nMaybe the user can find another use for the pants, like giving them to someone else or using the material for something else, instead of wearing them. That way, they don't go to waste but also adhere to Islamic guidelines.\n\nIn conclusion, the pants aren't permissible because of the silk content. It's better for the user to avoid wearing them to prevent any sin and to follow the teachings of Islam.\n</think>\n\nThe pants in question, made of 70% wool,"}

I work in an office where the only place available to perform wudu is the toilet area. I'm not sure if it's permissible to do wudu there. Also, I've been wiping over my shoes instead of taking them off to wash my feet because I'm worried about stepping on something impure, even though the area is clean. I need to figure out if both these practices are allowed in Islam.\n\nFirst, I should think about where wudu can be performed. I remember that wudu requires clean water and a clean place. The toilet area is where people use the restroom, so even if it's cleaned regularly, it's still a place where impurities are present. But maybe if it's the only option, it's acceptable. I should check if Islamic rulings allow performing wudu in the toilet under such circumstances.\n\nNext, regarding wiping over the shoes. Normally, when performing wudu, you have to wash your feet. But if you're wearing socks or shoes, you can wipe over them if certain conditions are met, like if the shoes are sturdy and not made of material that would allow water to seep through. However, I'm not sure if this is allowed in all situations or only under specific circumstances, like if removing them would cause inconvenience or if the floor isn't clean.\n\nI also need to consider the concept of 'najis' or impurity. Even if the toilet area is kept clean, it's still a place where impurities are present, so performing wudu there might not be ideal. But if there's no other option, maybe it's permissible. As for wiping over shoes, it's a matter of whether it's done correctly and under the right conditions.\n\nI should look up some Islamic rulings or fatwas on this. I recall that some scholars say that if the only place available is the toilet area, then it's permissible to perform wudu there as long as it's clean. For the wiping over shoes, known as 'mash,' it's allowed if the shoes meet certain criteria and if removing them would cause issues, like having to step on a dirty floor. So, in this case, since the person is worried about stepping on impurities, it might be acceptable to wipe over the shoes instead of removing them.\n\nI also need to make sure that the shoes are clean and made of the right material for mash.

", "Generated_Answer": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to help someone who has two concerns about purity in Islam, which is important for their prayers and daily life. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the person lives in a hostel and shares bathrooms with non-Muslims, who they refer to as \"kaafirs.\" They're worried about the purity of the bucket they use for ablution. They don't see any visible impurities but have read that they might need to throw out the water to purify the bucket. They're concerned whether they've been impure all this time and if they need to repeat their prayers.\n\nSecond, their roommate uses antiperspirant powder, and they see particles on the floor. They're worried if this powder is halal. When their leg touches these particles, which are less than a dirham in size, they're concerned about impurity transferring to their leg and the places they keep their feet.\n\nStarting with the first issue: the bucket in a shared bathroom. In Islamic jurisprudence, purity (taharah) is crucial. The bucket's purity depends on whether it's been contaminated with najasat (impurities). If there's no visible najasat, it's generally considered pure. The user's method of filling the bucket until water overflows might be sufficient if there's no visible impurity. However, if they've read that one must throw the water to purify it, perhaps that's referring to a situation where the bucket was previously contaminated.\n\nI think the key here is whether the bucket was already pure. If they didn't see any impurity, then using the water without throwing it out might still be acceptable. But if there's a doubt, it's better to err on the side of caution. Regarding repeating prayers, if they were unaware of the proper method, they might not need to repeat them, but consulting a scholar would be best.\n\nMoving to the second issue: the antiperspirant powder. If the powder is from halal sources, then it's not impure. Even if it's not, as long as it's not from a haram source, it might still be considered pure. The amount in question is less than a dirham, which is a small amount. In Islamic law, small amounts of impurity might be overlooked, especially if it's unintentional contact. So, the leg and the places touched might not become impure unless the substance itself is impure and the amount is significant.\n\nI should also consider"}

I have a few questions about the specific steps involved, especially regarding gargling, rinsing the nose, and the order of actions during the process. Let me break down each part and think through them one by one.\n\nFirst, the question about gargling. I remember that when you rinse your mouth during Ghusl, it's recommended to gargle so that the water reaches all parts of the mouth. But I'm a bit self-conscious because making the gargling noise might be heard by others outside the bathroom. I'm wondering if it's absolutely necessary to make that noise or if just rinsing without it would suffice. I think the intention is to ensure the mouth is properly cleansed, so maybe the noise isn't the key factor, but I'm not entirely sure.\n\nNext, regarding the nasal rinse. The user mentioned something about sniffing water up the nose and reaching the beginning of the hard bone or part of the nose. I'm not exactly clear on the proper technique here. Do I need to actually sniff the water so that it goes up into the nostrils, or is just putting water into the nose without sniffing enough? I've found it difficult to get the water to reach that point without forcefully sniffing, which is uncomfortable. I'm also concerned about whether not doing it properly would make the Ghusl invalid.\n\nLastly, the order of actions. The user is asking if it's permissible to start with a shower, then rinse the mouth and nose while showering. I'm under the impression that there's a specific order to Ghusl, like starting with certain intentions, washing the hands, then the private parts, rinsing the mouth and nose, etc. But I'm not sure if integrating this into a shower is acceptable or if it's better to do it separately to ensure all steps are correctly followed.\n\nLet me try to recall the steps of Ghusl. From what I remember, the major steps include:\n1. Making the intention (niyyah) to perform Ghusl.\n2. Washing the hands up to the wrists.\n3. Rinsing the mouth three times.\n4. Sniffing water into the nostrils three times.\n5. Washing the face three times.\n6. Washing the arms up to the elbows.\n7. Washing the head and neck.\n8.

{"Question": "Can men wear red? I heard it is not recommended.? --T--", "Answer": "There are many ahadith which permit the wearing of red by men. The ahadith on the wearing of red by men are more authentic in chains of transmitters, than the ahadith of prohibition, except clothes, which are dyed with saffron.Baraa reports that, The Prophet (Allah bless him and give him peace) was of medium build. I saw him once in a red garment and have never seen anything beautiful than him. (Bukhari)Abu Hujayfa reported similarly, saying, I saw the Prophet (Allah bless him and give him peace) in a red garment.Abu Dawud related from Hilal ibn Aamir from his father, I saw the Prophet (Allah bless him and give him peace) giving a sermon on a camel in Mina, and he had on him a red garment.Imam Zafar Ahmad Usmani quotes Durr al-Muhtar withHashiya ibn Abidin:There is no problem in all the colours for men, except those dyed with saffron.It is mentioned in Mujtaba, Quhastani, and Sharh Niqaya of Abu Makarim as follows: There is no problem in wearing red clothes. This indicates that the (karaha) offensiveness is slight (tanzihi) Allama Ibn Abidin says (wearing red clothes) has been narrated by Imam Abu Hanifa, as mentioned in Multaqat. And it shows that the karaha (offensiveness) is tanzihi, because the word la bas is used generally in leaving things, which is better.

(For them is the evil turn of fortune) and an evil consequence, (and Allah is wroth against them and hath cursed them) He banished them from all good, (and hath made ready for them) in the Hereafter (hell, a hapless journeys end) what an evil destination they will head for in the Hereafter.", "Generated_Answer": "<think>\nOkay, so I came across this question: \"Can men wear red? I heard it is not recommended.\" Hmm, that's interesting. I mean, I know red is a bold color, but I haven't heard that it's not recommended for men to wear. Maybe the person who asked this heard something specific, but I'm not sure. Let me think about this.\n\nFirst, I should consider cultural perspectives because different cultures have different associations with colors. In many Western cultures, red is often seen as a color of passion, energy, and power. I've seen men wearing red shirts, ties, and even suits, especially in formal or business settings. For example, a red tie is pretty common in politics and business as a symbol of confidence.\n\nBut wait, maybe in some cultures, red has different connotations. In some Asian cultures, red is a symbol of good luck and prosperity, so men might wear it during celebrations. However, I don't know of any culture where red is outright not recommended for men. Maybe in certain contexts, like funerals or specific religious events, but that's more about the occasion than the gender.\n\nThen there's the aspect of personal style and color coordination. Red is a strong color, so it might not complement every skin tone or outfit. For example, if someone has a cool skin tone, certain shades of red might clash, but that's more about personal style than a gender-based recommendation. Maybe the person heard that red doesn't look good on them, but that's subjective.\n\nAnother angle is the psychological impact of red. It's known to evoke strong emotions and can make the wearer stand out. Maybe some people think that men shouldn't wear red because it's too attention-seeking or not traditional. But fashion trends are always changing, and red has been a part of men's fashion for a long time, especially in accessories like ties, pocket squares, and shoes.\n\nI should also think about the context in which the advice was given. If someone told the person that men shouldn't wear red, it could be based on outdated fashion rules. Years ago, there were stricter guidelines about what colors men could wear, but nowadays, fashion is more inclusive and expressive. So, maybe it's just old advice that doesn't apply anymore.\n\nAdditionally, looking at celebrities and public figures, many men wear red on the red carpet and in public appearances. It's a way to make a statement. So if influential men are wearing red, it's probably acceptable and even encouraged in certain settings."}

But he should cut them to come lower than the ankles. And they should not wear anything that has been touched by (dyed with) saffron or Wars.\"<D>Narrated `Abdullah bin `Umar:A person stood up and asked, \"O Allahs: Apostle! What clothes may be worn in the state of Ihram?\" The Prophet replied, \"Do not wear a shirt or trousers, or any headgear (e.g. a turban), or a hooded cloak; but if somebody has no shoes he can wear leather stockings provided they are cut short off the ankles, and also, do not wear anything perfumed with Wars or saffron, and the Muhrima (a woman in the state of Ihram) should not cover her face, or wear gloves.\"<D>Aishah narrated that:\"When I would menstruate, Allahs Messenger ordered me to wear a waist wrap, then he would fondle me.\"<D>Allah then mentions the covenant He undertook with them, saying (And when We made a covenant with you) took your consent (and caused the Mount to tower above you) pulled out and fixed high above your heads the mountain for taking the covenant: (Hold fast that which We have given you) comply with what We have given of the scripture in earnestness and diligence, (and remember that which is therein) ofreward and chastisement, and recollect what is in it of the lawful and unlawful, (that ye may ward off (evil))in order that you may ward off Allahs wrath and torment and so that you may obey Him. <D>(It may be) and may be when used in connection with Allah denotes necessity (that our Lord will give us) in the Hereafter in exchange (better than this in place thereof) better than this garden.

It is not lawful for you forcibly) coercively (to inherit the women (of your deceased kinsmen)) the women of your fathers, (nor (that) ye should put constraint upon them) by preventing them from marrying again. This verse was revealed about Kabshah Bint Maan al-Ansariyyah and Muhsin Ibn Abi Qays al-Ansari; for before the advent of Islam, they used to inherit the women of their fathers (that ye may take away a part of that which ye have given them) take away part of that which your fathers gave them, (unless they be guilty of flagrant lewdness) unless they are guilty of fornication by the testimony of witnesses in which case they should be imprisoned. However, imprisoning fornicators was abrogated by the verse on stoning. In the pre-Islamic period, men used to inherit the wives of their fathers in the same way as they inherited their properties. The wife of a deceased father used to be inherited by the eldest son. If the woman was rich and beautiful, the eldest son would marry her without giving her any dowry. If, however, she was neither rich, young nor beautiful, he would not marry her but instead leave heruntouched until she ransomed herself with her own money. Allah forbade them from indulging in such apractice. Then He showed them how one must treat women, saying: (But consort with them) keep their company (in kindness) with beneficence and goodness, (for if ye hate them) i.e. hate their company (it may happen that ye hate a thing) their company (wherein Allah hath placed much good) Allah may provide you with righteous children from them.", "Generated_Answer": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether wearing a Kurta and Kufi is considered Sunnah and rewarding. I know that the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) wore certain types of clothing, but I'm not entirely sure if it's a requirement or just the style of his time. \n\nI remember hearing that the Prophet dressed in a simple and modest way, often wearing a thobe, which is like a long tunic, and a turban or some kind of head covering. So maybe the Kurta and Kufi are modern equivalents of that. But is it Sunnah to wear them specifically, or is it just the way people dressed back then?\n\nThen there's the question about wearing jeans and shirts. I've heard some people say that if you dress like non-Muslims, you're imitating them and that's not good. But I'm not sure if that's based on a Hadith or if it's just cultural opinion. Also, now a lot of Muslims wear jeans and shirts, so does that mean it's acceptable because it's common in our era?\n\nI think the key here is understanding the difference between cultural clothing and religious attire. The Sunnah is about following the Prophet's example, but it's also about the intention and the modesty of the clothing. So maybe as long as the clothes are modest and cover what they're supposed to cover, it doesn't matter if they're traditional or modern.\n\nI should check if there's any Hadith that specifically talks about clothing. I recall something about the Prophet advising against dressing like non-believers if it's done to show off or imitate them. But if the clothing is just the norm where you live and you're not trying to imitate, then it might be okay.\n\nAlso, I think the concept of hijab is more about modesty than specific garments. So whether you wear a Kurta or jeans, as long as you're covered appropriately, it should be fine. But I'm not entirely sure how the Sunnah applies here.\n\nMaybe it's also about cultural identity. Wearing traditional clothes might help in maintaining a Muslim identity, which could be spiritually rewarding. But I don't know if that's a direct Sunnah or just a personal choice.\n\nI should also consider the intention behind wearing certain clothes. If someone wears a Kurta and Kufi to follow the Sunnah and feel closer to the Prophet, that's a good intention. On the other hand, if someone wears jeans and shirts just"}

I know that Islam is a religion that emphasizes peace and submission to God, but like any person, Muslims can face emotional struggles. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should consider the Islamic perspective on emotions. I remember that in Islam, emotions are seen as natural, but managing them in a healthy way is important. So, what causes these negative emotions? Maybe it's due to life's challenges and trials. The Quran mentions that life is a test, so Muslims might feel sad or depressed when facing difficulties, whether it's personal issues, financial problems, health crises, or relationship troubles.\n\nAnother angle is the spiritual aspect. I've heard that having weak faith or being distant from Allah can lead to feelings of emptiness. If someone isn't practicing their religion as much as they should, they might feel disconnected, which can cause sadness. Also, Muslims believe in the concept of Qadar, which is divine decree. Sometimes, accepting tough situations as part of God's plan can be hard and might lead to emotional turmoil.\n\nI also recall that envy and negative social interactions can affect someone's mental state. The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) advised against envy and malice, so if someone is envious or facing mistreatment from others, that could contribute to their unhappiness. On the flip side, having good, supportive friends and family is important for emotional well-being.\n\nThen there's the afterlife perspective. Muslims believe in accountability in the hereafter, so fear of not meeting Allah's expectations or punishment could cause torment. However, Islam also teaches hope and mercy, so maybe a lack of balance between fear and hope can lead to sadness if someone focuses too much on their shortcomings without remembering Allah's forgiveness.\n\nAnother point is the influence of Shaytan, or Satan. In Islam, Shaytan is seen as a tempter who tries to mislead people. He can whisper negative thoughts and cause doubt, which might lead to depression or unhappiness if someone isn't vigilant in seeking refuge with Allah.\n\nAdditionally, there are worldly attachments. Muslims are taught not to be overly attached to material things because they can lead to greed and dissatisfaction. If someone is too focused on wealth or status and doesn't find contentment, it might result in unhappiness.\n\nI should also think about solutions from an Islamic standpoint. The Quran and Sunnah offer various remedies. For example, remembering Allah (Dh"}

[Reported by Bukhari and Muslim]Abu Talha relates (Allah be well pleased with him), that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said, The angels do not enter a house that has a dog or a picture.

I remember hearing something about dogs being impure, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me try to piece this together.\n\nFirst, I think it has something to do with the concept of \"najasah\" or impurity in Islamic law. I've heard that dogs are considered impure, which might mean that having them around could affect one's prayer or wudu. But I'm not certain about the details.\n\nI also recall that there are different schools of thought in Islam, like Hanafi, Shafi'i, Maliki, and Hanbali. Maybe they have different rulings on this. I think the Maliki school might be stricter, considering dogs as impure, while others might have a more lenient view.\n\nThen there's the aspect of purpose. I've heard that if someone keeps a dog for a specific need, like farming, herding, or protection, it might be more acceptable. But keeping them just as pets might not be recommended. I'm not sure if this is a general ruling or specific to certain situations.\n\nI remember something about the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) allowing a man to have a dog for herding. That makes me think that utility is a factor. So, maybe if the dog serves a functional purpose, it's permissible, but not just for companionship.\n\nThere's also the issue of saliva. I think if a dog licks a container, it needs to be washed seven times, with one of those being with dust. This might imply that dogs are considered unclean, hence the need for thorough cleansing.\n\nI wonder about the implications for prayer. If a dog is in the house, does it affect the prayer? I think the presence of a dog might invalidate the prayer, or at least make it makruh (disliked). So, if someone is praying and a dog is present, they might need to repeat their prayer or ensure the dog isn't nearby.\n\nBut then I've also heard that some scholars say that only the saliva is impure, not the entire dog. So, maybe the rest of the dog isn't considered impure, which could affect how Muslims interact with them.\n\nAnother point is about angels. I've heard that angels won't enter a house where there's a dog. That could be a reason why some scholars advise against keeping them as pets, to ensure that angels can enter and bring blessings.\n\nHowever, I'm also aware that in some cultures,"}

During a Ghazwa of his, he drew lots amongst us and the lot fell upon me, and I proceeded with him after Allah had decreed the use of the veil by women. I was carried in a Howdah (on the camel) and dismounted while still in it. When Allahs Apostle was through with his Ghazwa and returned home, and we approached the city of Medina, Allahs Apostle ordered us to proceed at night. When the order of setting off was given, I walked till I was past the army to answer the call of nature. After finishing I returned (to the camp) to depart (with the others) and suddenly realized that my necklace over my chest was missing. So, I returned to look for it and was delayed because of that. The people who used to carry me on the camel, came to my Howdah and put it on the back of the camel, thinking that I was in it, as, at that time, women were light in weight, and thin and lean, and did not use to eat much. So, those people did not feel the difference in the heaviness of the Howdah while lifting it, and they put it over the camel. At that time I was a young lady. They set the camel moving and proceeded on. I found my necklace after the army had gone, and came to their camp to find nobody. So, I went to the place where I used to stay, thinking that they would discover my absence and come back in my search. While in that state, I felt sleepy and slept. Safwan bin Muattal As-Sulami Adh-Dhakwani was behind the army and reached my abode in the morning. When he saw a sleeping person, he came to me, and he used to see me before veiling. So, I got up when I heard him saying, \"Inna lil-lah-wa inn a ilaihi rajiun (We are for Allah, and we will return to Him).\" He made his camel knell down. He got down from his camel, and put his leg on the front legs of the camel and then I rode and sat over it. Safwan set out walking, leading the camel by the rope till we reached the army who had halted to take rest at midday. Then whoever was meant for destruction, fell into destruction, (some people accused me falsely) and the leader of the false accusers was `Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul. After that we returned to Medina, and I became ill for one month while the people were spreading the forged statements of the false accusers. I was feeling during my ailment as if I were not receiving the usual kindness from the Prophet which I used to receive from him when I got sick. But he would come, greet and say, How is that (girl)? I did not know anything of what was going on till I recovered from my ailment and went out with Um Mistah to the Manasi where we used to answer the call of nature, and we used not to go to answer the call of nature except from night to night and that was before we had lavatories near to our houses. And this habit of ours was similar to the habit of the old Arabs in the open country (or away from houses). So. I and Um Mistah bint Ruhm went out walking. Um Mistah stumbled because of her long dress and on that she said, Let Mistah be ruined. I said, You are saying a bad word. Why are you abusing a man who took part in (the battle of) Badr? She said, O Hanata (you there) didnt you hear what they said? Then she told me the rumors of the false accusers. My sickness was aggravated, and when I returned home, Allahs Apostle came to me, and after greeting he said, How is that (girl)? I requested him to allow me to go to my parents. I wanted then to be sure of the news through them I Allahs Apostle allowed me, and I went to my parents and asked my mother, What are the people talking about? She said, O my daughter! Dont worry much about this matter. By Allah, never is there a charming woman loved by her husband who has other wives, but the women would forge false news about her. I said, Glorified be Allah! Are the people really taking of this matter? That night I kept on weeping and could not sleep till morning. In the morning Allahs Apostle called `Ali bin Abu Talib and Usama bin Zaid when he saw the Divine Inspiration delayed, to consul them about divorcing his wife (i.e. `Aisha). Usama bin Zaid said what he knew of the good reputation of his wives and added, O Allahs Apostle! Keep you wife, for, by Allah, we know nothing about her but good. `Ali bin Abu Talib said, O Allahs Apostle! Allah has no imposed restrictions on you, and there are many women other than she, yet you may ask the woman-servant who will tell you the truth. On that Allahs Apostle called Buraira and said, O Burair. Did you ever see anything which roused your suspicions about her? Buraira said, No, by Allah Who has sent you with the Truth, I have never seen in her anything faulty except that she is a girl of immature age, who sometimes sleeps and leaves the dough for the goats to eat. On that day Allahs Apostle ascended the pulpit and requested that somebody support him in punishing `Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul. Allahs Apostle said, Who will support me to punish that person (`Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul) who has hurt me by slandering the reputation of my family? By Allah, I know nothing about my family but good, and they have accused a person about whom I know nothing except good, and he never entered my house except in my company. Sa`d bin Mu`adh got up and said, O Allahs Apostle! by Allah, I will relieve you from him. If that man is from the tribe of the Aus, then we will chop his head off, and if he is from our brothers, the Khazraj, then order us, and we will fulfill your order. On that Sa`d bin Ubada, the chief of the Khazraj and before this incident, he had been a pious man, got up, motivated by his zeal for his tribe and said, By Allah, you have told a lie; you cannot kill him, and you will never be able to kill him. On that Usaid bin Al-Hadir got up and said (to Sa`d bin Ubada), By Allah! you are a liar. By Allah, we will kill him; and you are a hypocrite, defending the hypocrites. On this the two tribes of Aus and Khazraj got excited and were about to fight each other, while Allahs Apostle was standing on the pulpit. He got down and quieted them till they became silent and he kept quiet. On that day I kept on weeping so much so that neither did my tears stop, nor could I sleep. In the morning my parents were with me and I had wept for two nights and a day, till I thought my liver would burst from weeping. While they were sitting with me and I was weeping, an Ansari woman asked my permission to enter, and I allowed her to come in. She sat down and started weeping with me. While we were in this state, Allahs Apostle came and sat down and he had never sat with me since the day they forged the accusation. No revelation regarding my case came to him for a month. He recited Tashah-hud (i.e. None has the right to be worshipped but Allah and Muhammad is His Apostle) and then said, O `Aisha! I have been informed such-and-such about you; if you are innocent, then Allah will soon reveal your innocence, and if you have committed a sin, then repent to Allah and ask Him to forgive you, for when a person confesses his sin and asks Allah for forgiveness, Allah accepts his repentance. When Allahs Apostle finished his speech my tears ceased completely and there remained not even a single drop of it. I requested my father to reply to Allahs Apostle on my behalf. My father said, By Allah, I do not know what to say to Allahs Apostle. I said to my mother, Talk to Allahs Apostle on my behalf. She said, By Allah, I do not know what to say to Allahs Apostle. I was a young girl and did not have much knowledge of the Quran. I said. I know, by Allah, that you have listened to what people are saying and that has been planted in your minds and you have taken it as a truth. Now, if I told you that I am innocent and Allah knows that I am innocent, you would not believe me and if I confessed to you falsely that I am guilty, and Allah knows that I am innocent you would believe me. By Allah, I dont compare my situation with you except to the situation of Josephs father (i.e. Jacob) who said, So (for me) patience is most fitting against that which you assert and it is Allah (Alone) whose help can be sought. Then I turned to the other side of my bed hoping that Allah would prove my innocence. By Allah I never thought that Allah would reveal Divine Inspiration in my case, as I considered myself too inferior to be talked of in the Holy Quran. I had hoped that Allahs Apostle might have a dream in which Allah would prove my innocence. By Allah, Allahs Apostle had not got up and nobody had left the house before the Divine Inspiration came to Allahs Apostle. So, there overtook him the same state which used to overtake him, (when he used to have, on being inspired divinely). He was sweating so much so that the drops of the sweat were dropping like pearls though it was a (cold) wintry day. When that state of Allahs Apostle was over, he was smiling and the first word he said, `Aisha! Thank Allah, for Allah has declared your innocence. My mother told me to go to Allahs Apostle . I replied, By Allah I will not go to him and will not thank but Allah. So Allah revealed: \"Verily! They who spread the slander are a gang among you . . .\" (24.11) When Allah gave the declaration of my Innocence, Abu Bakr, who used to provide for Mistah bin Uthatha for he was his relative, said, By Allah, I will never provide Mistah with anything because of what he said about Aisha. But Allah later revealed: -- \"And let not those who are good and wealthy among you swear not to help their kinsmen, those in need and those who left their homes in Allahs Cause. Let them forgive and overlook. Do you not wish that Allah should forgive you? Verily! Allah is Oft-forgiving, Most Merciful.\" (24.22) After that Abu Bakr said, Yes ! By Allah! I like that Allah should forgive me, and resumed helping Mistah whom he used to help before. Allahs Apostle also asked Zainab bint Jahsh (i.e. the Prophets wife about me saying, What do you know and what did you see? She replied, O Allahs Apostle! I refrain to claim hearing or seeing what I have not heard or seen. By Allah, I know nothing except goodness about Aisha.\" Aisha further added \"Zainab was competing with me (in her beauty and the Prophets love), yet Allah protected her (from being malicious), for she had piety.\"<D>Narrated Ibn `Abbas:The first lady to use a girdle was the mother of Ishmael. She used a girdle so that she might hide her tracks from Sarah. Abraham brought her and her son Ishmael while she was suckling him, to a place near the Ka`ba under a tree on the spot of Zamzam, at the highest place in the mosque. During those days there was nobody in Mecca, nor was there any water So he made them sit over there and placed near them a leather bag containing some dates, and a small water-skin containing some water, and set out homeward. Ishmaels mother followed him saying, \"O Abraham! Where are you going, leaving us in this valley where there is no person whose company we may enjoy, nor is there anything (to enjoy)?\" She repeated that to him many times, but he did not look back at her Then she asked him, \"Has Allah ordered you to do so?\" He said, \"Yes.\" She said, \"Then He will not neglect us,\" and returned while Abraham proceeded onwards, and on reaching the Thaniya where they could not see him, he faced the Ka`ba, and raising both hands, invoked Allah saying the following prayers: O our Lord! I have made some of my offspring dwell in a valley without cultivation, by Your Sacred House (Ka`ba at Mecca) in order, O our Lord, that they may offer prayer perfectly. So fill some hearts among men with love towards them, and (O Allah) provide them with fruits, so that they may give thanks. (14.37) Ishmaels mother went on suckling Ishmael and drinking from the water (she had). When the water in the water-skin had all been used up, she became thirsty and her child also became thirsty. She started looking at him (i.e. Ishmael) tossing in agony; She left him, for she could not endure looking at him, and found that the mountain of Safa was the nearest mountain to her on that land. She stood on it and started looking at the valley keenly so that she might see somebody, but she could not see anybody. Then she descended from Safa and when she reached the valley, she tucked up her robe and ran in the valley like a person in distress and trouble, till she crossed the valley and reached the Marwa mountain where she stood and started looking, expecting to see somebody, but she could not see anybody. She repeated that (running between Safa and Marwa) seven times.\" The Prophet said, \"This is the source of the tradition of the walking of people between them (i.e. Safa and Marwa). When she reached the Marwa (for the last time) she heard a voice and she asked herself to be quiet and listened attentively. She heard the voice again and said, O, (whoever you may be)! You have made me hear your voice; have you got something to help me?\" And behold! She saw an angel at the place of Zamzam, digging the earth with his heel (or his wing), till water flowed from that place. She started to make something like a basin around it, using her hand in this way, and started filling her water-skin with water with her hands, and the water was flowing out after she had scooped some of it.\" The Prophet added, \"May Allah bestow Mercy on Ishmaels mother! Had she let the Zamzam (flow without trying to control it) (or had she not scooped from that water) (to fill her water-skin), Zamzam would have been a stream flowing on the surface of the earth.\" The Prophet further added, \"Then she drank (water) and suckled her child. The angel said to her, Dont be afraid of being neglected, for this is the House of Allah which will be built by this boy and his father, and Allah never neglects His people. The House (i.e. Ka`ba) at that time was on a high place resembling a hillock, and when torrents came, they flowed to its right and left. She lived in that way till some people from the tribe of Jurhum or a family from Jurhum passed by her and her child, as they (i.e. the Jurhum people) were coming through the way of Kada. They landed in the lower part of Mecca where they saw a bird that had the habit of flying around water and not leaving it. They said, This bird must be flying around water, though we know that there is no water in this valley. They sent one or two messengers who discovered the source of water, and returned to inform them of the water. So, they all came (towards the water).\" The Prophet added, \"Ishmaels mother was sitting near the water. They asked her, Do you allow us to stay with you?\" She replied, Yes, but you will have no right to possess the water. They agreed to that.\" The Prophet further said, \"Ishmaels mother was pleased with the whole situation as she used to love to enjoy the company of the people. So, they settled there, and later on they sent for their families who came and settled with them so that some families became permanent residents there. The child (i.e. Ishmael) grew up and learnt Arabic from them and (his virtues) caused them to love and admire him as he grew up, and when he reached the age of puberty they made him marry a woman from amongst them. After Ishmaels mother had died, Abraham came after Ishmaels marriage in order to see his family that he had left before, but he did not find Ishmael there. When he asked Ishmaels wife about him, she replied, He has gone in search of our livelihood. Then he asked her about their way of living and their condition, and she replied, We are living in misery; we are living in hardship and destitution, complaining to him. He said, When your husband returns, convey my salutation to him and tell him to change the threshold of the gate (of his house). When Ishmael came, he seemed to have felt something unusual, so he asked his wife, Has anyone visited you? She replied, Yes, an old man of so-and-so description came and asked me about you and I informed him, and he asked about our state of living, and I told him that we were living in a hardship and poverty. On that Ishmael said, Did he advise you anything? She replied, Yes, he told me to convey his salutation to you and to tell you to change the threshold of your gate. Ishmael said, It was my father, and he has ordered me to divorce you. Go back to your family. So, Ishmael divorced her and married another woman from amongst them (i.e. Jurhum). Then Abraham stayed away from them for a period as long as Allah wished and called on them again but did not find Ishmael. So he came to Ishmaels wife and asked her about Ishmael. She said, He has gone in search of our livelihood. Abraham asked her, How are you getting on? asking her about their sustenance and living. She replied, We are prosperous and well-off (i.e. we have everything in abundance). Then she thanked Allah Abraham said, What kind of food do you eat? She said. Meat. He said, What do you drink? She said, Water.\" He said, \"O Allah! Bless their meat and water.\" The Prophet added, \"At that time they did not have grain, and if they had grain, he would have also invoked Allah to bless it.\" The Prophet added, \"If somebody has only these two things as his sustenance, his health and disposition will be badly affected, unless he lives in Mecca.\" The Prophet added,\" Then Abraham said Ishmaels wife, \"When your husband comes, give my regards to him and tell him that he should keep firm the threshold of his gate. When Ishmael came back, he asked his wife, Did anyone call on you? She replied, Yes, a good-looking old man came to me, so she praised him and added. He asked about you, and I informed him, and he asked about our livelihood and I told him that we were in a good condition. Ishmael asked her, Did he give you any piece of advice? She said, Yes, he told me to give his regards to you and ordered that you should keep firm the threshold of your gate. On that Ishmael said, It was my father, and you are the threshold (of the gate). He has ordered me to keep you with me. Then Abraham stayed away from them for a period as long as Allah wished, and called on them afterwards. He saw Ishmael under a tree near Zamzam, sharpening his arrows. When he saw Abraham, he rose up to welcome him (and they greeted each other as a father does with his son or a son does with his father). Abraham said, O Ishmael! Allah has given me an order. Ishmael said, Do what your Lord has ordered you to do. Abraham asked, Will you help me? Ishmael said, I will help you. Abraham said, Allah has ordered me to build a house here, pointing to a hillock higher than the land surrounding it.\" The Prophet added, \"Then they raised the foundations of the House (i.e. the Ka`ba). Ishmael brought the stones and Abraham was building, and when the walls became high, Ishmael brought this stone and put it for Abraham who stood over it and carried on building, while Ishmael was handing him the stones, and both of them were saying, O our Lord! Accept (this service) from us, Verily, You are the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing. The Prophet added, \"Then both of them went on building and going round the Ka`ba saying: O our Lord ! Accept (this service) from us, Verily, You are the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing.\" (2.127)<D>Narrated Aisha:(The wife of the Prophet) Whenever Allahs Apostle intended to go on a journey, he used to draw lots among his wives and would take with him the one on whom the lot had fallen. Once he drew lots when he wanted to carry out a Ghazwa, and the lot came upon me. So I proceeded with Allahs Apostle after Allahs order of veiling (the women) had been revealed and thus I was carried in my howdah (on a camel) and dismounted while still in it. We carried on our journey, and when Allahs Apostle had finished his Ghazwa and returned and we approached Medina, Allahs Apostle ordered to proceed at night. When the army was ordered to resume the homeward journey, I got up and walked on till I left the army (camp) behind. When I had answered the call of nature, I went towards my howdah, but behold ! A necklace of mine made of Jaz Azfar (a kind of black bead) was broken and I looked for it and my search for it detained me. The group of people who used to carry me, came and carried my howdah on to the back of my camel on which I was riding, considering that I was therein. At that time women were light in weight and were not fleshy for they used to eat little (food), so those people did not feel the lightness of the howdah while raising it up, and I was still a young lady. They drove away the camel and proceeded. Then I found my necklace after the army had gone. I came to their camp but found nobody therein so I went to the place where I used to stay, thinking that they would miss me and come back in my search. While I was sitting at my place, I felt sleepy and slept. Safwan bin Al-Muattil As-Sulami Adh- Dhakw-ani was behind the army. He had started in the last part of the night and reached my stationing place in the morning and saw the figure of a sleeping person. He came to me and recognized me on seeing me for he used to see me before veiling. I got up because of his saying: \"Inna Li l-lahi wa inna ilaihi rajiun,\" which he uttered on recognizing me. I covered my face with my garment, and by Allah, he did not say to me a single word except, \"Inna Li l-lahi wa inna ilaihi rajiun,\" till he made his shecamel kneel down whereupon he trod on its forelegs and I mounted it. Then Safwan set out, leading the she-camel that was carrying me, till we met the army while they were resting during the hot midday. Then whoever was meant for destruction, fell in destruction, and the leader of the Ifk (forged statement) was `Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul. After this we arrived at Medina and I became ill for one month while the people were spreading the forged statements of the people of the Ifk, and I was not aware of anything thereof. But what aroused my doubt while I was sick, was that I was no longer receiving from Allahs Apostle the same kindness as I used to receive when I fell sick. Allahs Apostle would enter upon me, say a greeting and add, \"How is that (lady)?\" and then depart. That aroused my suspicion but I was not aware of the propagated evil till I recovered from my ailment. I went out with Um Mistah to answer the call of nature towards Al-Manasi, the place where we used to relieve ourselves, and used not to go out for this purpose except from night to night, and that was before we had lavatories close to our houses. And this habit of ours was similar to the habit of the old Arabs (in the deserts or in the tents) concerning the evacuation of the bowels, for we considered it troublesome and harmful to take lavatories in the houses. So I went out with Um Mistah who was the daughter of Abi Ruhm bin `Abd Manaf, and her mother was daughter of Sakhr bin Amir who was the aunt of Abi Bakr As-Siddiq, and her son was Mistah bin Uthatha. When we had finished our affair, Um Mistah and I came back towards my house. Um Mistah stumbled over her robe whereupon she said, \"Let Mistah be ruined ! \" I said to her, \"What a bad word you have said! Do you abuse a man who has taken part in the Battle of Badr? She said, \"O you there! Didnt you hear what he has said?\" I said, \"And what did he say?\" She then told me the statement of the people of the Ifk (forged statement) which added to my ailment. When I returned home, Allahs Apostle came to me, and after greeting, he said, \"How is that (lady)?\" I said, \"Will you allow me to go to my parents?\" At that time I intended to be sure of the news through them. Allahs Apostle allowed me and I went to my parents and asked my mother, \"O my mother! What are the people talking about?\" My mother said, \"O my daughter! Take it easy, for by Allah, there is no charming lady who is loved by her husband who has other wives as well, but that those wives would find fault with her.\" I said, \"Subhan Allah! Did the people really talk about that?\" That night I kept on weeping the whole night till the morning. My tears never stopped, nor did I sleep, and morning broke while I was still weeping, Allahs Apostle called `Ali bin Abi Talib and Usama bin Zaid when the Divine Inspiration delayed, in order to consult them as to the idea of divorcing his wife. Usama bin Zaid told Allahs Apostle of what he knew about the innocence of his wife and of his affection he kept for her. He said, \"O Allahs Apostle! She is your wife, and we do not know anything about her except good.\" But `Ali bin Abi Talib said, \"O Allahs Apostle! Allah does not impose restrictions on you; and there are plenty of women other than her. If you however, ask (her) slave girl, she will tell you the truth.\" `Aisha added: So Allahs Apostle called for Barira and said, \"O Barira! Did you ever see anything which might have aroused your suspicion? (as regards Aisha). Barira said, \"By Allah Who has sent you with the truth, I have never seen anything regarding Aisha which I would blame her for except that she is a girl of immature age who sometimes sleeps and leaves the dough of her family unprotected so that the domestic goats come and eat it.\" So Allahs Apostle got up (and addressed) the people an asked for somebody who would take revenge on `Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul then. Allahs Apostle, while on the pulpit, said, \"O Muslims! Who will help me against a man who has hurt me by slandering my family? By Allah, I know nothing except good about my family, and people have blamed a man of whom I know nothing except good, and he never used to visit my family except with me,\" Sa`d bin Mu`adh Al-Ansari got up and said, \"O Allahs Apostle! By Allah, I will relieve you from him. If he be from the tribe of (Bani) Al-Aus, then I will chop his head off; and if he be from our brethren, the Khazraj, then you give us your order and we will obey it.\" On that, Sa`d bin Ubada got up, and he was the chief of the Khazraj, and before this incident he had been a pious man but he was incited by his zeal for his tribe. He said to Sa`d (bin Mu`adh), \"By Allah the Eternal, you have told a lie! You shall not kill him and you will never be able to kill him!\" On that, Usaid bin Hudair, the cousin of Sa`d (bin Mu`adh) got up and said to Sa`d bin Ubada, \"You are a liar! By Allah the Eternal, we will surely kill him; and you are a hypocrite defending the hypocrites!\" So the two tribes of Al-Aus and Al-Khazraj got excited till they were on the point of fighting with each other while Allahs Apostle was standing on the pulpit. Allahs Apostle continued quietening them till they became silent whereupon he became silent too. On that day I kept on weeping so much that neither did my tears stop, nor could I sleep. In the morning my parents were with me, and I had wept for two nights and a day without sleeping and with incessant tears till they thought that my liver would burst with weeping. While they were with me and I was weeping, an Ansari woman asked permission to see me. I admitted her and she sat and started weeping with me. While I was in that state, Allahs Apostle came to us, greeted, and sat down,. He had never sat with me since the day what was said, was said. He had stayed a month without receiving any Divine Inspiration concerning my case. Allahs Apostle recited the Tashahhud after he had sat down, and then said, \"Thereafter, O `Aisha! I have been informed such and-such a thing about you; and if you are innocent, Allah will reveal your innocence, and if you have committed a sin, then ask for Allahs forgiveness and repent to Him, for when a slave confesses his sin and then repents to Allah, Allah accepts his repentance.\" When Allahs Apostle had finished his speech, my tears ceased completely so that I no longer felt even a drop thereof. Then I said to my father, \"Reply to Allahs Apostle on my behalf as to what he said.\" He said, \"By Allah, I do not know what to say to Allahs Apostle.\" Then I said to my mother, \"Reply to Allahs Apostle.\" She said, \"I do not know what to say to Allahs Apostle.\" Still a young girl as I was and though I had little knowledge of Quran, I said, \"By Allah, I know that you heard this story (of the Ifk) so much so that it has been planted in your minds and you have believed it. So now, if I tell you that I am innocent, and Allah knows that I am innocent, you will not believe me; and if I confess something, and Allah knows that I am innocent of it, you will believe me. By Allah, I cannot find of you an example except that of Josephs father: \"So (for me) patience is most fitting against that which you assert and it is Allah (Alone) Whose help can be sought. Then I turned away and lay on my bed, and at that time I knew that I was innocent and that Allah would reveal my innocence. But by Allah, I never thought that Allah would sent down about my affair, Divine Inspiration that would be recited (forever), as I considered myself too unworthy to be talked of by Allah with something that was to be recited: but I hoped that Allahs Apostle might have a vision in which Allah would prove my innocence. By Allah, Allahs Apostle had not left his seat and nobody had left the house when the Divine Inspiration came to Allahs Apostle . So there overtook him the same hard condition which used to overtake him (when he was Divinely Inspired) so that the drops of his sweat were running down, like pearls, though it was a (cold) winter day, and that was because of the heaviness of the Statement which was revealed to him. When that state of Allahs Apostle was over, and he was smiling when he was relieved, the first word he said was, \"Aisha, Allah has declared your innocence.\" My mother said to me, \"Get up and go to him.\" I said, \"By Allah, I will not go to him and I will not thank anybody but Allah.\" So Allah revealed: \"Verily! They who spread the Slander are a gang among you. Think it not....\" (24.11-20). When Allah revealed this to confirm my innocence, Abu Bakr As-Siddiq who used to provide for Mistah bin Uthatha because of the latters kinship to him and his poverty, said, \"By Allah, I will never provide for Mistah anything after what he has said about Aisha\". So Allah revealed: (continued...) (continuing... 1): -6.274:... ... \"Let not those among you who are good and are wealthy swear not to give (help) to their kinsmen, those in need, and those who have left their homes for Allahs Cause. Let them Pardon and forgive (i.e. do not punish them). Do you not love that should forgive you? Verily Allah is Oft-forgiving. Most Merciful.\" (24.22) Abu Bakr said, \"Yes, by Allah, I wish that Allah should forgive me.\" So he resumed giving Mistah the aid he used to give him before and said, \"By Allah, I will never withold it from him at all.\" Aisha further said: Allahs Apostle also asked Zainab bint Jahsh about my case. He said, \"O Zainab! What have you seen?\" She replied, \"O Allahs Apostle! I protect my hearing and my sight (by refraining from telling lies). I know nothing but good (about Aisha).\" Of all the wives of Allahs Apostle, it was Zainab who aspired to receive from him the same favor as I used to receive, yet, Allah saved her (from telling lies) because of her piety. But her sister, Hamna, kept on fighting on her behalf so she was destroyed as were those who invented and spread the slander.<D>(And whomsoever it is Allahs will to guide) to His religion, (He expandeth his bosom) His heart (unto the Surrender) unto accepting Islam, (and whomsoever it is His will to send astray) to leave in error and disbelief, (He maketh his bosom) He leaves his heart (close) like the ferrule of a spear (and narrow) in doubt; this could also mean: the light cannot find a way, or a passage to his heart (as if he were engaged insheer ascent) like a person who is told to rise in heaven: the heart of such a person is not guided to Islam.

It's making me doubt whether my wudoo is still valid. I don't like looking at my skin after wudoo because I always find something that makes me question if I need to redo it. I want to know how to deal with this waswasah. \n\nFirst, I need to understand what waswasah is. From what I know, it's like whispering or doubts that come into your mind, often related to worship or practices. It's like when you're trying to pray or do something religious, and suddenly you're not sure if you did it right. In this case, it's about doubting the validity of wudoo because of physical sensations or sights.\n\nSo, the main issue here is dealing with these doubts and not letting them affect my wudoo. I need to find a way to ignore these feelings without worrying that my wudoo might actually be invalid. But how?\n\nI remember reading that in Islamic teachings, once you've completed wudoo correctly, you're considered to have it until you're certain that it's been invalidated. Certainty is important here. So, if I'm just feeling something but I'm not certain it's invalidating, I shouldn't act on that doubt.\n\nMaybe I should focus on the fact that as long as I followed the proper steps of wudoo, I shouldn't question it afterward. Like, after washing each part the required number of times and making sure I didn't miss any spots, I should trust that my wudoo is valid. \n\nBut then, what if I actually see something? Like, if I see a spot on my skin, should I check if it's something that would break wudoo? Or should I just ignore it? I think the rule is that unless I'm certain that something broke my wudoo, like passing gas or touching the opposite sex, I don't need to worry about it.\n\nSo, maybe the solution is to avoid looking at my skin after wudoo. If I don't look, I won't see those little things that make me doubt. It's like, out of sight, out of mind. But I'm not sure if that's the right approach. Should I be proactive in checking, or is it better to just not look at all?\n\nI also"}

Hmm, this is a pretty broad question. I guess I need to break it down into parts. First, clothing serves different purposes, right? Like, there's functional clothing for everyday use, formal wear for special occasions, sportswear for physical activities, and maybe even protective clothing for certain jobs or environments. So, the form of the clothing probably depends a lot on what it's being used for.\n\nI remember reading somewhere that clothing has both practical and decorative purposes. So, maybe the form is influenced by both function and aesthetics. For example, a dress might be more about style and looking nice, while workwear is more about durability and practicality. But I'm not entirely sure how to define the \"form.\" Does it refer to the shape, the design, the style, or something else?\n\nI think form in clothing could relate to the structure, the cut, the way it's tailored. So, a woman's clothing form would vary based on the intended use. For instance, a business suit is structured differently than a casual t-shirt and jeans. The suit has a more formal structure with specific cuts and tailoring to present professionalism, while casual clothes are more relaxed and comfortable.\n\nCultural factors must also play a role. In some cultures, traditional clothing has specific forms that are considered appropriate or modest. For example, a sari in India has a distinct form with draping and fabric that's different from a western-style dress. So, the form of clothing is influenced by cultural norms and traditions.\n\nComfort is another aspect. The form of clothing should allow for ease of movement and comfort. For example, sportswear is designed to be form-fitting and flexible, allowing for movement during exercise. In contrast, formal gowns might prioritize aesthetics over comfort, with structures like corsets or tight fits that might not be as comfortable but look elegant.\n\nI also think about how fashion trends influence the form of clothing. Trends can dictate whether certain styles, like high-waisted pants or off-the-shoulder tops, are popular. These trends shape the form of clothing each season, with designers creating pieces that fit the current aesthetic.\n\nThere's also the aspect of personal expression. The form of clothing can be a way for women to express their individuality. Some might prefer more structured, tailored looks, while others might go for flowing, bohemian styles. So, the form isn't one-size-fits-all"}

Then he brought his promissory note and he wrote off (the debt) with his hand and said: Make payment when you find yourself solvent enough to pay me back; if you are not, then there is no liability upon you. These two eyes of mine saw, and he (AbuI-Yasar) placed his fingers upon his eyes and these two ears of mine heard and my heart retained, and he pointed towards his heart that Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: He who gives time to one who is financially hard up (in the payment of debt) or writes off his debt, Allah will provide him His shadow. I said to him: My uncle, if you get the cloak of your servant and you give him your two clothes, or take his two clothes of Maafir and give him your cloak, then there would be one dress for you and one for him. He wiped my head and said: O Allah, bless the son of my brother. O, son of my brother, these two very eyes of mine saw and these two ears of mine listened to and this heart of mine retained this, and he pointed towards the heart that Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: Feed them (the servants) and clothe them (the servants) what you wear, and if I give him the goods of the world, it is easy for me than this that he should take my virtues on the Day of Resurrection. We went on till we came to Jabir b. Abdullah in the mosque and he was busy in observing prayer in one cloth which he had joined at its opposite ends. I made my way through the people till I sat between him and the Qibla and I said: May Allah have mercy upon you. Do you observe prayer with one cloth on your body whereas your mantle is lying at your side? He pointed me with his hand towards my breast just like this and he separated his fingers and bent them in the shape of a bow. And (he said): I thought that a fool like you should come to me so that he should see me as I do and he should then also do like it. Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) came to us in this very mosque and he had in his hand the twig of the palm-tree and he saw mucus towards the Qibla of the mosque and he erased it with the help of the twig. He then came to us and said: Who amongst you likes that Allah should turn His face away from him? We were afraid. He then again said: Who amongst you likes that Allah should turn His face away from him? We were afraid. He again said: Who amongst you likes that Allah should turn His face away from him? We said: Allahs Messenger, none of us likes it. And he said: If one amongst you stands for prayer, Allah, the Exalted and Glorious, is before him he should not spit in front of him, or on his right side, but should spit on his left side beneath his left foot and if he is impelled to do so all of a sudden (in spite of himself) he should then spit in his cloth and fold it in some part of it. (and he further said: ) Bring some sweet-smelling thing. A young man who belonged to our tribe stood up, went and brought scent in his palm. Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) took that and applied it to the end of that twig and then touched the place where there had been mucus. Jabir said: This is why you should apply scent to your mosques. It is reported on the same authority: We set out along with Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) on an expedition of Batn Buwat. He (the Holy Prophet) was in search of al-Majdi b. Amr al-Juhani. (We had so meagre equipment) that five. six or seven of us had one camel to ride and so we mounted it turn by turn. Once there wan. the turn of an Ansari to ride upon the camel. He made it kneel down to ride over it (and after having. mounted it), he tried to raise it up but it hesitated. So he said. May there be curse of Allah upon you! Thereupon Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: Who is there to curse his camel? He said: Allahs Messenger, it is I. Thereupon he said: Get down from the camel and let us not have in our company the cursed one. Dont curse your own selves, nor your children. nor your belongings. There is the possibility that your curse may synchronies with the time when Allah is about to confer upon you what you demand and thus your prayer may be readily responded. It is reported on the same authority: We set out on an expedition along with Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) until it was evening, and we had been near a. water reservoir of Arabia. Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: Who would be the person who would go ahead and set right the reservoir and drink water himself and serve us with it? Jabir said: I stood up and said: Allahs Messenger, it is I who am ready to do that. Thereupon Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: Who is the person to accompany Jabir? And then Jabbar b. Sakhr stood up. So we went to that well and poured in that tank a bucket or two of water and plastered it with clay and then began to fill it (with water) until it was filled to the brim. Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) was the first who appeared before us, and he said: Do you (both) permit me to drink water out of it? We said: Yea, Allahs Messenger. He led his camel to drink water and it drank. He then pulled its rein and it stretched its legs and began to urinate. He then took it aside and made it kneel down at another place and then came to the tank and performed ablution. I then got up and performed ablution like the ablution of Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him), and Jabbar b. Sakhr went in order to relieve himself and Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) got up to observe prayer and there was a mantle over me. I tried to invert its ends but it was too short (to cover my body easily). It had its borders. I then inverted it (the mantle) and drew its opposite ends and then tied them at my neck. I then came and stood upon the left side of Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him). He caught hold of me and made me go round behind him, until he made me stand on his right side. Then Jabbar b. Sakhr came. He performed ablution and then came and stood on the left side of Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him). Then Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) caught hold of our hands together, pushed us back and made us stand behind him. Then Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) began to look upon me with darting looks, but I did not perceive that. After that I became aware of it and he pointed with the gesture of his hand that I should wrap my loin-cloth. When Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) had finished the prayer, he said: Jabir! I said: Allahs Messenger, at thy beck and call. He said: When the cloth around you is inadequate, then tie the opposite ends but when it is small, tie it over the lower body. Jabir reported: We set out on an expedition with Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) and the only means of sustenance for every person amongst us was only one date for a day and we used to chew it. And we struck the leaves with the help of our bow and ate them until the sides of our mouths were injured. It so happened one day that a person was overlooked and not given a date. We carried that person and bore witness to the fact that he had not been given that date so he was offered that and he got up and received that. Jabir reported: We set out on an expedition along with Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) until we got down at a spacious valley and Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) went to relieve himself. I followed him with a bucket full of water and Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) looked about and he found no privacy but two trees at the end of the valley and Allahs Messenger (may. peace be upon him) went to one of them and took hold of one of its twigs and said: Be thou under my control by the permission of Allah, and so it came under his control like the camel who has its nosestring in the hand of its rider, and then he came to the second tree and took hold of a twig and said: Be thou under my control with the permission of Allah, and it came under his control, and when he came in the middle of the two trees he joined together the two twigs and said: join with the permission of Allah. Jabir said: I was afraid lest Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) should be aware of my nearness and go still farther. And Muhammad b. Abbad has used the word\" faitabd\" and I began to talk to myself. And as I saw, I suddenly found Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) before me and the two trees were separated and each one of them was standing at its place. I saw Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) standing for a short time, nodding his head towards right and left. Ismail pointed towards the right and left with the help of his head (in order to demonstrate how the Holy Prophet had pointed). Then he (the Holy Prophet) came to me and said: Jabir did you see my place where I was standing? I said: Allahs Messenger, yes. He then said: Then you should go to those two trees and cut a twig from each of them and go to that place with them where I was standing and stand there where I was standing and place a twig on the right and a twig on the left. Jabir said: I set out and took hold of a stone and broke it and sharpened it and then I came to those trees and cut a twig from each one of them. I then came dragging them until I stood at the place where Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) had been standing and placed a twig on the right and a twig on the left. Then I met him and said: Allahs Messenger, I have done that, but (kindly) explain to me the reason for it. Thereupon he said: I passed by two graves the occupants of which had been undergoing torment. I liked to make intercession for them so that the might be relieved of this torment y as long as these twigs remain fresh. Jabir said: We came back to the (camp of the) army and Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: Jabir, call people for per- forming wudu. I cried: Come and perform wudu, come and perform wudu, come and perform wudu. I said: Allahs Messenger, there is not even a drop of water in the army camp, and there. was a person who used to cool the water for Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) in the old water-skin which kept hanging by the twig. He asked me to go to such and such Ansari and ask him to see if there was any water in that skin. I went to him and cast a glance in it but did not find anything but a drop in the mouth of that water-skin and if I were to draw that, the water-skins,. dried part would suck it up. I came to Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) and said: Allahs Messenger, I have not found anything in it but a drop of water in the mouth of the water-skin and now if I were to draw that, it would be absorbed. He said: Go and bring that to me. I brought that to him. He took hold of it -and began to utter something which I could not understand and then pressed it with his hand and gave that to me and said: Jabir, announce for the tub to be brought. So I announced that the tub of the army (be brought). It was brought accordingly and I placed it before him (the Holy Prophet). Thereupon Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) placed his hands in the tub like this: with his fingers stretched out, and then he placed his fingers at the bottom of the tub and said: Jabir, take it (that waters-skin) and pour water over me, by reciting Bismillah, and I poured water and I said: Bismillah, and found water sprouting out between the fingers of Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him). Then that tub gushed forth until it was filled up and the Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: Jabir, make an announcement to the effect: He who needs water should take that. Jabir said: The people came and got water until they were all satiated. I said: Is there anyone left who wants to get it? And Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) then lifted up his hand from that tub and it was still full. Then the people made a complaint to Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) about hunger and he said: May Allah provide you food! We came to the bank of the ocean and the ocean was tossing and it threw out a big animal and we lit fire and cooked it and took it until we had eaten to our hearts content. Jabir said: I and such and such five persons entered Its socket and nobody could see us until we had come out, and we took hold of one of its ribs and twisted it into a sort of arch, then we called the tallest of the persons of the army and the hugest of the camels of the army and it had the big saddle over it, and it could easily pass through it without the rider having need to bend down.<D>(And he who findeth not (the wherewithal)) the means to free a slave, (let him fast for two successive months before they touch one another) before they have sexual intercourse with one another; (and for him who is unable to do so) i.e. to fast because he is weak ((the penance is) the feeding of sixty needy ones) giving each needy person half a measure (half a sa) of wheat or one measure (sa) of barley or dates.

But he regretted doing so, and Allah revealed how he could expiate the sin he committed. The Prophet (pbuh) told him: You should free a slave. Aws said: I have very little money and it costs a great deal to free a slave. The Prophet (pbuh) said: Then you should fast two successive months. Aws said: I cannot do so!

The Prophet (pbuh) ordered for him a measure of dates and commanded him to give it to the needy. Aws said: I do not know of anyone in Medina who is more in need of it than I. The Prophet (pbuh) told him to eat it and, with the help of another person, the Prophet (pbuh) fed 60 needy people, and this allowed Aws to go back to hiswife whom he had declared unlawful for himself. <D>(And, O my people!

They mentioned getting conflicting advice from different people. Some say that if the purdah touches the face, it's a big sin, so they shouldn't wear it. Others claim it's a recent Indian ulama thing, and another person suggests wearing a normal purdah and paying dum, which I think refers to a penalty or expiation.\n\nFirst, I should break down the key points. The user wants to wear ihram purdah but is unsure about the rules. They're asking about what dum is and the proper way to observe purdah in the Haram while in ihram.\n\nI remember that in ihram, men have specific rules, like not covering their heads or faces. But for women, the rules are a bit different. Women are supposed to cover their heads but not their faces. However, some scholars allow covering the face if it's done without touching it, maybe using a face veil that's tied behind.\n\nThe term \"dum\" probably refers to damm, which is a penalty, like a sacrifice or extra charity. If a pilgrim violates the ihram rules, they might need to pay this as expiation.\n\nI should check the Hanafi and other schools' views. In Hanafi, women can cover their faces as long as it doesn't touch. If it does, they have to pay damm. Other schools might be stricter, saying it's not allowed at all.\n\nSo, the user should be told that covering the face in ihram is allowed in some schools with conditions. They should tie the face veil without it touching their face to avoid penalties. Also, if they do end up touching, they might need to pay damm, which is usually feeding the poor.\n\nThey also asked about purdah in the Haram. They should maintain modesty, cover their heads, and avoid tight or revealing clothes. It's more about the intention and following the rules than just the clothing.\n\nIn summary, I need to explain that while covering the face is permissible under certain conditions, they need to be cautious to avoid penalties. Also, clarify the concept of damm and how to handle it if needed. And remind them to focus on their spiritual state and not just the outward appearance.\n</think>\n\nIhram is a state of consecration for the rituals of Hajj or Umrah, and the rules of Ihram apply differently to men and women.

I'm not really sure why that's the case, though. Maybe I'm overreacting, but I want to make sure I'm handling this correctly. \n\nFirst, I should figure out why pigskin might be a problem. Pigskin is a type of leather, right? So, is there something about pigskin that could transfer to other clothes? Maybe dyes or chemicals used in the tanning process? I'm not certain, but I think some leathers can have finishes or treatments that might rub off.\n\nI remember hearing that some leather products can bleed dye, especially if they're new or not treated properly. So, if my jacket is new, it might have excess dye that could transfer to other fabrics. That could be a problem, especially with lighter-colored clothes. But if the jacket is older and the dye has already set, maybe it's not as much of an issue.\n\nI should also consider how my other clothes have come into contact with the jacket. Have they been in direct contact, like being worn together, or just stored nearby? If it's just stored nearby, maybe there's less risk. But if I've been wearing the jacket over other clothes, there's a chance of dye transfer through friction or sweat.\n\nNow, about washing them. Can I just throw all the potentially affected clothes into the washing machine? I think it depends on the fabric. Delicates probably shouldn't be machine washed, but maybe heavier clothes like t-shirts or jeans can handle it. I should check the care labels on each garment to be safe.\n\nAnother thought: should I wash them separately from other laundry? If there's a risk of dye transfer, washing them separately might prevent any accidental staining of other clothes. Maybe using a color-catching sheet would help, just in case.\n\nI also wonder if dry cleaning is necessary for some items. If a garment can't be machine washed, taking it to the dry cleaner might be the way to go. But I'm not sure how to explain the situation to the dry cleaner. Maybe just mention the possibility of dye transfer from a leather jacket.\n\nI'm also thinking about whether I should wash the jacket itself. If it's the source of the potential dye, maybe cleaning it would help. But leather jackets are usually spot-clean only, and machine washing them could ruin the material. So,"}

I know that some people say it's haram because of the association with gambling, like poker, which is definitely haram. But I don't gamble; I just do tricks and create patterns with cards for fun. My local ustaz said it's okay as long as it doesn't make people think I have supernatural powers or worship me. But I'm still confused because I saw some websites saying playing cards is haram, even if it's not for gambling. I need to understand why there's a difference between magic tricks and gambling with cards.\n\nFirst, I should think about what Islam says about gambling. The Quran clearly prohibits maisir, which is gambling. It's mentioned in Surah Al-Ma'idah, verse 90, where it says that intoxicants and gambling are abominations from Satan. So, poker and any game that involves betting is definitely haram. But what about using cards just for tricks and art?\n\nMagic tricks, in general, are about illusion and skill. They don't involve chance or betting. The purpose is to entertain and amaze people, not to make them think I have supernatural powers. So, if I make it clear that it's just a trick and doesn't involve any sort of magic that implies I have divine powers, it should be okay. But I need to be careful about how I present it. If people start thinking I have supernatural abilities, that could be a problem.\n\nCardistry is more like juggling or creating patterns, which is an art form. It doesn't involve any gambling or chance. It's just about manipulating the cards in a skillful way. So, as long as I'm not using it for any haram activities, it should be permissible. But I should check if there are any scholarly opinions on this.\n\nI also need to consider my intentions. Am I doing this to show off or to seek fame? If my intention is pure, just to have fun and maybe even to show the beauty of Islam through my skills, then it's acceptable.

That's great because it's cost-effective, but sometimes they put ads on my site without my control. These ads could be for anything—insurance, cars, gambling, cruises, etc. Some of them have animations or images, and they link to other sites. My concern is that some of these ads might have content that's not permissible under Islamic law, like promoting gambling or showing inappropriate images. \n\nI don't have any control over what ads appear or when, which makes me worried. I don't want my site to inadvertently promote something that's haram. So, I'm thinking about whether I should switch to another web hosting company that doesn't run ads, or maybe pay WordPress to remove the ads. \n\nFirst, I need to understand what the Islamic stance is on this. If the ads are promoting haram activities, like gambling or things that are considered sinful, then having those on my site might be problematic. Even if I don't control them, is it my responsibility to ensure that my platform doesn't host such content?\n\nI remember reading that in Islam, it's important to avoid facilitating or promoting anything haram, even if it's unintentional. So, if the ads are leading people to haram sites or encouraging haram activities, maybe I have a moral obligation to prevent that as much as I can.\n\nBut since I don't have control over the ads, maybe the solution is to remove them. That would involve either paying WordPress to upgrade so that ads are removed or moving to a different hosting service where I can have more control over the content.\n\nI should also consider the impact on my website. If I move to a different host, will it affect my site's performance, SEO, or user experience? Alternatively, paying WordPress might be a straightforward solution without the hassle of migrating the site.\n\nAnother thought: are there any other options? Maybe using ad blockers on my site, but I don't think WordPress allows that on their free plan. Or perhaps reaching out to WordPress support to see if they can filter out certain types of ads, but I doubt they offer such granularity on free accounts.\n\nSo, the main options are: pay for the no-ads upgrade or switch hosts. I need to weigh the costs and benefits. If the no-ads upgrade is affordable and keeps my site on a reliable platform, that might be the easiest choice.

But I'm not sure if that's accurate. Let me think this through.\n\nFirst, I know that in Islam, there are rules about modesty and clothing. For men, I think it's about covering from the navel to the knee, and avoiding clothing that's considered extravagant or imitative of non-Muslim practices. But I'm not entirely clear on the specifics.\n\nSo, a tie is a common part of business attire in many places. It's not inherently religious, right? It's just a piece of cloth worn around the neck. But maybe the issue is about imitating non-Muslim customs or something like that. I've heard the term \"Bid'ah\" before, which refers to innovations in religion that are frowned upon. Could wearing a tie be seen as Bid'ah?\n\nI should check some Islamic sources or fatwas. From what I remember, some scholars say that as long as the clothing isn't tight or revealing, and doesn't have symbols or designs that contradict Islamic values, it's permissible. So a tie might be okay if it's worn for professional reasons and doesn't have any inappropriate designs.\n\nBut then, there's the aspect of necessity. If a job requires wearing a tie, and it's a halal job otherwise, does the tie make it haram? I don't think so. Maybe the person who suggested quitting was concerned about the tie being a form of imitating non-Muslim dress, but I think as long as the intention is professional and not to imitate, it's acceptable.\n\nI also wonder about cultural differences. In some Muslim-majority countries, wearing a tie is standard in business settings, so it must be permissible there. Maybe the issue is more about the context and intention behind wearing it rather than the tie itself.\n\nAnother point is the fit and appearance. If the tie is too flashy or draws undue attention, that might be an issue. Modesty is key, so a simple, modest tie should be fine. Also, the rest of the outfit should adhere to Islamic dress codes, like not being tight or transparent.\n\nSo, putting it all together, I think Muslims can wear a tie for a halal job if it's required. The key factors are the intention, the modesty of the attire, and ensuring that it doesn't conflict with Islamic values. There's"}

", "Generated_Answer": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether implanting a tooth is halaal or haraam in Islam. I'm not very familiar with Islamic rulings, so I'll start by breaking down the question and considering the relevant principles.\n\nFirst, I know that in Islam, things are either halaal (permitted) or haraam (forbidden). There might also be cases where something is makruh (disliked) or mustahabb (recommended), but I'm focusing on halaal and haraam here.\n\nTooth implantation is a medical procedure where a dentist inserts an artificial tooth into the jaw to replace a missing tooth. It's a common procedure and generally considered safe and effective. But I need to think about any Islamic concerns related to medical procedures, especially those involving the body.\n\nI remember that Islam places a lot of emphasis on health and hygiene. The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) is reported to have said, \"Your body has a right over you,\" which indicates that taking care of one's health is important. So, medical procedures that improve health are likely permissible.\n\nBut I should consider if there's anything specific about tooth implants that might make them haraam. For example, the materials used in implants. If they contain pork products or other non-halaal substances, that could be an issue. I know that in Islam, consuming pork is haraam, and products derived from pigs are also generally avoided unless they've been processed in a way that makes them permissible, like through purification.\n\nI should check what tooth implants are made of. From what I know, dental implants are typically made of titanium, which is a metal and is inert, meaning it doesn't react with the body. Titanium is also used in other medical implants, like hip replacements. Since it's a metal and not derived from animals, it shouldn't pose a problem in terms of being haraam.\n\nAnother consideration is the process itself. Does the procedure involve any steps that might be against Islamic teachings? For instance, does it involve any form of tattooing, which is haraam? I don't think so. Tooth implantation is a surgical procedure where a post is inserted into the jawbone, and then a crown is placed on top. It's more like a prosthetic, which should be acceptable.\n\nI also recall that in Islam, necessity makes things permissible. If a medical procedure is necessary for health, like replacing a tooth to chew food properly or to prevent further dental issues, then it's"}

She used a girdle so that she might hide her tracks from Sarah. Abraham brought her and her son Ishmael while she was suckling him, to a place near the Ka`ba under a tree on the spot of Zamzam, at the highest place in the mosque. During those days there was nobody in Mecca, nor was there any water So he made them sit over there and placed near them a leather bag containing some dates, and a small water-skin containing some water, and set out homeward. Ishmaels mother followed him saying, \"O Abraham! Where are you going, leaving us in this valley where there is no person whose company we may enjoy, nor is there anything (to enjoy)?\" She repeated that to him many times, but he did not look back at her Then she asked him, \"Has Allah ordered you to do so?\" He said, \"Yes.\" She said, \"Then He will not neglect us,\" and returned while Abraham proceeded onwards, and on reaching the Thaniya where they could not see him, he faced the Ka`ba, and raising both hands, invoked Allah saying the following prayers: O our Lord! I have made some of my offspring dwell in a valley without cultivation, by Your Sacred House (Ka`ba at Mecca) in order, O our Lord, that they may offer prayer perfectly. So fill some hearts among men with love towards them, and (O Allah) provide them with fruits, so that they may give thanks. (14.37) Ishmaels mother went on suckling Ishmael and drinking from the water (she had). When the water in the water-skin had all been used up, she became thirsty and her child also became thirsty. She started looking at him (i.e. Ishmael) tossing in agony; She left him, for she could not endure looking at him, and found that the mountain of Safa was the nearest mountain to her on that land. She stood on it and started looking at the valley keenly so that she might see somebody, but she could not see anybody. Then she descended from Safa and when she reached the valley, she tucked up her robe and ran in the valley like a person in distress and trouble, till she crossed the valley and reached the Marwa mountain where she stood and started looking, expecting to see somebody, but she could not see anybody. She repeated that (running between Safa and Marwa) seven times.\" The Prophet said, \"This is the source of the tradition of the walking of people between them (i.e. Safa and Marwa). When she reached the Marwa (for the last time) she heard a voice and she asked herself to be quiet and listened attentively. She heard the voice again and said, O, (whoever you may be)! You have made me hear your voice; have you got something to help me?\" And behold! She saw an angel at the place of Zamzam, digging the earth with his heel (or his wing), till water flowed from that place. She started to make something like a basin around it, using her hand in this way, and started filling her water-skin with water with her hands, and the water was flowing out after she had scooped some of it.\" The Prophet added, \"May Allah bestow Mercy on Ishmaels mother! Had she let the Zamzam (flow without trying to control it) (or had she not scooped from that water) (to fill her water-skin), Zamzam would have been a stream flowing on the surface of the earth.\" The Prophet further added, \"Then she drank (water) and suckled her child. The angel said to her, Dont be afraid of being neglected, for this is the House of Allah which will be built by this boy and his father, and Allah never neglects His people. The House (i.e. Ka`ba) at that time was on a high place resembling a hillock, and when torrents came, they flowed to its right and left. She lived in that way till some people from the tribe of Jurhum or a family from Jurhum passed by her and her child, as they (i.e. the Jurhum people) were coming through the way of Kada. They landed in the lower part of Mecca where they saw a bird that had the habit of flying around water and not leaving it. They said, This bird must be flying around water, though we know that there is no water in this valley. They sent one or two messengers who discovered the source of water, and returned to inform them of the water. So, they all came (towards the water).\" The Prophet added, \"Ishmaels mother was sitting near the water. They asked her, Do you allow us to stay with you?\" She replied, Yes, but you will have no right to possess the water. They agreed to that.\" The Prophet further said, \"Ishmaels mother was pleased with the whole situation as she used to love to enjoy the company of the people. So, they settled there, and later on they sent for their families who came and settled with them so that some families became permanent residents there. The child (i.e. Ishmael) grew up and learnt Arabic from them and (his virtues) caused them to love and admire him as he grew up, and when he reached the age of puberty they made him marry a woman from amongst them. After Ishmaels mother had died, Abraham came after Ishmaels marriage in order to see his family that he had left before, but he did not find Ishmael there. When he asked Ishmaels wife about him, she replied, He has gone in search of our livelihood. Then he asked her about their way of living and their condition, and she replied, We are living in misery; we are living in hardship and destitution, complaining to him. He said, When your husband returns, convey my salutation to him and tell him to change the threshold of the gate (of his house). When Ishmael came, he seemed to have felt something unusual, so he asked his wife, Has anyone visited you? She replied, Yes, an old man of so-and-so description came and asked me about you and I informed him, and he asked about our state of living, and I told him that we were living in a hardship and poverty. On that Ishmael said, Did he advise you anything? She replied, Yes, he told me to convey his salutation to you and to tell you to change the threshold of your gate. Ishmael said, It was my father, and he has ordered me to divorce you. Go back to your family. So, Ishmael divorced her and married another woman from amongst them (i.e. Jurhum). Then Abraham stayed away from them for a period as long as Allah wished and called on them again but did not find Ishmael. So he came to Ishmaels wife and asked her about Ishmael. She said, He has gone in search of our livelihood. Abraham asked her, How are you getting on? asking her about their sustenance and living. She replied, We are prosperous and well-off (i.e. we have everything in abundance). Then she thanked Allah Abraham said, What kind of food do you eat? She said. Meat. He said, What do you drink? She said, Water.\" He said, \"O Allah! Bless their meat and water.\" The Prophet added, \"At that time they did not have grain, and if they had grain, he would have also invoked Allah to bless it.\" The Prophet added, \"If somebody has only these two things as his sustenance, his health and disposition will be badly affected, unless he lives in Mecca.\" The Prophet added,\" Then Abraham said Ishmaels wife, \"When your husband comes, give my regards to him and tell him that he should keep firm the threshold of his gate. When Ishmael came back, he asked his wife, Did anyone call on you? She replied, Yes, a good-looking old man came to me, so she praised him and added. He asked about you, and I informed him, and he asked about our livelihood and I told him that we were in a good condition. Ishmael asked her, Did he give you any piece of advice? She said, Yes, he told me to give his regards to you and ordered that you should keep firm the threshold of your gate. On that Ishmael said, It was my father, and you are the threshold (of the gate). He has ordered me to keep you with me. Then Abraham stayed away from them for a period as long as Allah wished, and called on them afterwards. He saw Ishmael under a tree near Zamzam, sharpening his arrows.

So, ethically, I think I'm okay with these products because they offer options for people.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should consider the ethical implications more deeply. Some people have strong objections to abortion, considering it morally wrong. If I promote abortion medicines, am I contributing to something that goes against certain ethical standards? On the other hand, others see it as a necessary healthcare service. I need to weigh both perspectives.\n\nAlso, I should think about the legal aspect. Are these products legal where the company operates? If they are, then promoting them isn't against the law. But I should check the company's policies and how they handle these products. Do they adhere to ethical standards in their business practices?\n\nAnother angle is the company's mission and values. If their mission is to provide accessible healthcare, especially to those who might not have easy access otherwise, that aligns with positive goals. But if the company is involved in any unethical practices, like aggressive marketing or not providing proper information, that could be a problem.\n\nI should also consider the impact of these products on society. Birth control has been shown to empower women, reduce unintended pregnancies, and lower the rate of abortions. Abortion medicines, when used safely and legally, can provide women with a necessary option. So, promoting these could have a positive impact on public health.\n\nBut what about my personal comfort? If I feel that promoting abortion goes against my personal beliefs, even if I see the broader benefits, it might affect my job satisfaction. I need to assess how important this is to me personally.\n\nI should also look into the company's other products. If they offer a range of medicines beyond just birth"}
{"Question": "What are some general principles related to halal meat?

(iii) When Allahs Apostle entered (the house), he saw a cooking pot on the fire but he was given bread and meat soup from the soup of the home. The Prophet said, \"Didnt I see the cooking pot (on the fire)?\" It was said, \"That is the meat given in charity to Barira, and you do not eat the (things given in) charity.\" The Prophet said, \"It is an object of charity for Barira, and it is a present for us.\"<D>Ibn Aun reported:I wrote to Nafi inquiring from him whether it was necessary to extend (to the disbelievers) an invitation to accept (Islam) before meeting them in fight. He wrote (in reply) to me that it was necessary in the early days of Islam. The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) made a raid upon Banu Mustaliq while they were unaware and their cattle were having a drink at the water. He killed those who fought and imprisoned others. On that very day, he captured Juwairiya bint al-Harith. Nafi said that this tradition was related to him by Abdullah b.

Then this (injunction) was revealed by the verse in Surat an-Nur: \"No blame on you whether you eat in company or separately.\" When a rich man (after revelation) invited a man from his people to eat food in his house, he would say: I consider it a sin to eat from it, and he said: a poor man is more entitled to it than I. The Arabic word tajannah means sin or fault. It was then declared lawful to eat something on which the name of Allah was mentioned, and it was made lawful to eat the flesh of an animal slaughtered by the people of the Book.<D>(And We verily gave unto Moses the Scripture) i.e. the Torah, (and there was strife thereupon) about the Scripture of Moses: some believed in it while others did not; (and had it not been for a Word that had already gone forth) enjoined (from thy Lord) to delay His chastisement from your nation, (the case would have been judged between them) their destruction would have already happened and chastisement would have seized them, (and Lo! they are in grave doubt) manifest doubt (concerning it).<D>(Make ready for them) for the Banu Qurayzah as well as for others (all thou canst of force) of arms (and of horses tethered) of female tethered horses which are prepared for fighting, (that thereby ye may dismay) that you may strike fear by means of these horses in (the enemy of Allah) with regard to religion (and your enemy) by killing them, (and others beside them) besides the Banu Qurayzah and all the Arabs; it is also said that this is a reference to the disbelievers among the jinn (whom you know not) you do not know their number.

I'm not very familiar with this, so I'll start by breaking it down.\n\nFirst, what does \"halal\" mean? I think it's an Arabic term for something that's permissible under Islamic law. So halal meat would be meat that Muslims are allowed to eat. But I'm not sure about the specifics. I remember hearing that it has to do with how the animal is slaughtered, but there might be more to it.\n\nI think the process involves the animal being slaughtered by a Muslim, and they have to say a prayer, maybe \"Bismillah\" or something like that. The cut is made on the throat to make sure the animal dies quickly and doesn't suffer. But wait, is that all? Maybe there are other factors, like the animal being in good health before slaughter. I'm not sure if it's allowed to eat animals that were sick or injured.\n\nAlso, I've heard that some animals are haram, like pigs, but I'm not certain about others. Maybe carnivorous animals or those that are considered impure. So, for example, birds of prey might not be halal.\n\nAnother thing is the tools used for slaughter. I think the knife has to be sharp so that the animal doesn't feel much pain. If the knife is dull, that might be considered inhumane and thus not halal.\n\nNow, about trusting others on whether meat is halal. I guess it depends on the source. If a reliable Islamic authority certifies the meat, then it's probably trustworthy. But if someone just says it's halal without proper knowledge, maybe it's not reliable. I should look for certifications from known organizations.\n\nI also wonder about mechanically slaughtered meat. Is that halal? I think some scholars say it's okay if a Muslim was involved in the process, but others might not accept it. So, it's a bit controversial.\n\nWhat about stunning the animals before slaughter? Some places stun them to make it more humane, but I'm not sure if that's allowed in halal practices. I think some scholars say it's permissible as long as it doesn't kill the animal before the actual slaughter.\n\nSo, putting this together, the principles would involve the animal's health, the method of slaughter, the person performing it, and avoiding any haram substances. Trusting others would mean checking their credibility and"}

The user is asking if these looks can be linked to hypocrisy, mental behavior, insincerity, or the effects of sins. Hmm, that's an interesting topic.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what exactly the user is referring to. They mention \"strange looks\" that are annoying and sometimes people can't help it. So, it's about facial expressions that might not align with what the person is saying or feeling. I guess sometimes when you talk to someone, their face might not match their words, which can be confusing or off-putting.\n\nNow, the user wants to know if this can be traced to hypocrisy or mental behavior. Hypocrisy is when someone pretends to have virtues or moral principles that they don't actually have. So, could a strange look be a sign of that? Maybe, but I'm not sure. People can have various reasons for their expressions, not necessarily because they're being hypocritical.\n\nMental behavior is a broad term. It could relate to psychological states, emotions, or even disorders. For example, someone with social anxiety might have a different facial expression because they're nervous, not necessarily because they're insincere. So, maybe the look isn't about hypocrisy but more about their mental state.\n\nInsincerity is another angle. If someone isn't being genuine, their facial expressions might not match their words. But I think insincerity is more about intent than just the face. The face could be a clue, but it's not the only indicator.\n\nThen, the user mentions the effect of sins done with the face or any form of sins. This seems to bring in a more moral or religious perspective. The idea that engaging in sinful behavior could affect one's facial expressions is an interesting concept. I'm not sure if there's a direct link, but perhaps over time, negative behaviors could influence how someone presents themselves, including their facial expressions.\n\nI should also consider cultural factors. In some cultures, certain facial expressions might be more common or have different meanings. What seems strange in one culture might be normal in another. So, the perception of a strange look could be subjective based on cultural background.\n\nAdditionally, non-verbal communication plays a huge role. Sometimes people aren't aware of their facial expressions, and it's just a subconscious reaction. It might not have anything to do with their character or intentions but more about their current emotional state or habits.\n\nI also"}

There's a situation where a Muslim sister and her child passed away, and the community is debating whether women should attend the burial. The men say it's not allowed because women are more emotional. I find that statement to be sexist and I want to understand the Islamic perspective on this.\n\nFirst, I need to look into Islamic teachings and see what the Quran and Hadith say about women attending funerals. I remember that there are specific rulings about funerals, like how they should be conducted, prayers, and burials. But I'm not sure about the participation of women.\n\nI think I should start by checking the Hadith. I recall that the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) mentioned something about women attending funerals. Maybe in Sahih Bukhari or Muslim. I should look up if there are any authentic narrations about this.\n\nWait, I remember hearing that the Prophet allowed women to attend funerals but discouraged them from wailing or showing excessive grief. So maybe it's about the manner of participation rather than a complete prohibition.\n\nI should also consider the practice of the companions. Were there instances where women attended funerals? For example, did Aisha or other prominent female companions attend funerals? I think they did, but I'm not entirely sure.\n\nAnother point is the emotional argument. The men in the community say women are more emotional, so they shouldn't attend. But is that a valid reason in Islam? Or is it just a cultural practice? I think Islamic rulings are based on divine revelation, not cultural assumptions about emotions.\n\nI also wonder about the strength of the evidence. If the Hadith says women can attend, but some scholars might have different opinions, how do we reconcile that? Maybe it's a matter of different interpretations within the Islamic tradition.\n\nAdditionally, what about the participation in the actual burial? I think men typically handle the burial, but women can certainly attend the funeral prayers and the burial if they wish, as long as they maintain modesty and don't engage in excessive mourning.\n\nSo, putting this together, it seems that women are allowed to attend funerals, but with certain guidelines. The idea that they can't attend because they are more emotional doesn't hold up against Islamic teachings. It might be a cultural bias rather than an Islamic ruling.\n\nI should also check if there are any scholars who have addressed this issue.

{"Question": "I have a question regarding the legality of hanging African style masks on the wall as decoration. Is it permissible? Does it matter on how much detail the mask face has? These masks are usually a stylized face mask. Sometimes the facial features are generalized and other times they are quite detailed. ? --T--", "Answer": "Assalamu alaikum,It would be disliked (makruh) to hang such masks, for two reasons:a) they are close representations of the face (even if only in a stylized manner). Representing the face itself is not permitted. That which is similar to the impermissible is at least disliked;b) masks very often have religious significance, particularly in African cultures, as the article below from the Encyclopdia Britannica shows. We have been commanded to avoid the religious symbols and imagery of other religions., and He alone gives success.Wassalam,Faraz Rabbani It is mentioned in the Encyclopdia Britannicathat:The functions and forms of masksMasks are as extraordinarily varied in appearance as they are in function or fundamental meaning. Many masks are primarily associated with ceremonies that have religious and social significance or are concerned with funerary customs, fertility rites, or curing sickness. Other masks are used on festive occasions or to portray characters in a dramatic performance and in re-enactments of mythological events. Masks are also used for warfare and as protective devices in certain sports, as well as frequently being employed as architectural ornament.Social and religious usesMasks representing potentially harmful spirits were often used to keep a required balance of power or a traditional relationship of inherited positions within a culture. The forms of these masks invariably were prescribed by tradition, as were their uses. This type of mask was often associated with secret societies, especially in Africa, where the greatest range of types and functions can be found. They were also widely used among Oceanic peoples of the South Pacific and the American Indians and are even used in some of the folk rites still performed in Europe.Masks have served an important role as a means of discipline and have been used to admonish women, children, and criminals. Common in China, Africa, Oceania, and North America, admonitory masks usually completely cover the features of the wearer. It is believed among some of the African Negro tribes that the first mask was an admonitory one. A child, repeatedly told not to, persisted in following its mother to fetch water. To frighten and discipline the child, the mother painted a hideous face on the bottom of her water gourd. Others say the mask was invented by a secret African society to escape recognition while punishing marauders. In New Britain, members of a secret terroristic society called the Dukduk appear in monstrous five-foot masks to police, to judge, and to execute offenders. Aggressive supernatural spirits of an almost demonic nature are represented by these masks, which are constructed from a variety of materials, usually including tapa, or bark cloth, and the pith of certain reeds. These materials are painted in brilliant colours, with brick red and acid green predominating.In many cultures throughout the world, a judge wears a mask to protect him from future recriminations. In this instance, the mask represents a traditionally sanctioned spirit from the past who assumes responsibility for the decision levied on the culprit.Rituals, often nocturnal, by members of secret societies wearing ancestor masks are reminders of the ancient sanction of their conduct. In many cultures, these masked ceremonials are intended to prevent miscreant acts and to maintain the circumscribed activities of the tribe. Along the Guinea coast of West Africa, for instance, many highly realistic masks represent ancestors who enjoyed specific cultural roles; the masks symbolize sanction and control when donned by the wearer. Among some of the Dan and Ngere tribes of Liberia and Ivory Coast, ancestor masks with generic features act as intermediaries for the transmission of petitions or offerings of respect to the gods. These traditional ancestral emissaries exert by their spirit power a social control for the community.Particularly among Oceanic peoples, American Indians, and Negro tribes of Africa, certain times of the year are set aside to honour spirits or ancestors. Among non literate peoples who cannot record their own histories, masked rituals act as an important link between past and present, giving a sense of historic continuity that strengthens their social bond. On these occasions, masks usually recognizable as dead chieftains, relatives, friends, or even foes are worn or exhibited. Gifts are made to the spirits incarnated in the masks, while in other instances dancers wearing stylized mourning masks perform the prescribed ceremony.In western Melanesia, the ancestral ceremonial mask occurs in a great variety of forms and materials. The Sepik River area in north central New Guinea is the source of an extremely rich array of these mask forms mostly carved in wood, ranging from small faces to large fantastic forms with a variety of appendages affixed to the wood, including shell, fibre, animal skins, seed, flowers, and feathers. These masks are highly polychromed with earth colours of red and yellow, lime white, and charcoal black. They often represent supernatural spirits as well as ancestors and therefore have both a religious and a social significance.Members of secret societies usually conduct the rituals of initiation, when a young man is instructed in his future role as an adult and is acquainted with the rules controlling the social stability of the tribe. Totem and spiritualistic masks are donned by the elders at these ceremonies. Sometimes the masks used are reserved only for initiations. Among the most impressive of the initiation masks are the exquisitely carved human faces of west coast African Negro tribes. In western and central Congo (Kinshasa), in Africa, large, colourful helmet like masks are used as a masquerading device when the youth emerges from the initiation area and is introduced to the villagers as an adult of the tribe. After a lengthy ordeal of teaching and initiation rites, for instance, a youth of the Pende tribe appears in a distinctive colourful mask indicative of his new role as an adult. The mask is later cast aside and replaced by a small ivory duplicate, worn as a charm against misfortune and as a symbol of his manhood.Believing everything in nature to possess a spirit, man found authority for himself and his family by identifying with a specific nonhuman spirit. He adopted an object of nature; then he mythologically traced his ancestry back to the chosen object; he preempted the animal as the emblem of himself and his clan. This is the practice of totem, which consolidates family pride and distinguishes social lines. Masks are made to house the totem spirit. The totem ancestor is believed actually to materialize in its mask; thus masks are of the utmost importance in securing protection and bringing comfort to the totem clan.The Papuans of New Guinea build mammoth masks called hevehe,attaining 20 feet in height. They are constructed of a palm wood armature covered in bark cloth; geometric designs are stitched on with painted cane strips. These fantastic mananimal masks are given a frightening aspect. When they emerge from the mens secret clubhouse, they serve to protect the members of the clan. The so-called totem pole of the Alaskan and British Columbian Indian fulfills the same function. The African totem mask is often carved from ebony or other hard woods, designed with graceful lines and showing a highly polished surface. Animal masks, their features elongated and beautifully formalized, are common in western Africa. Dried grass, woven palm fibres, coconuts, and shells, as well as wood are employed in the masks of New Guinea, New Ireland, and New Caledonia. Represented are fanciful birds, fishes, and animals with distorted or exaggerated features.The high priest and medicine man, or the shaman, frequently had his own very powerful totem, in whose mask he could exorcise evil spirits, punish enemies, locate game or fish, predict the weather, and, most importantly, cure disease.The Northwest Coast Indians of North America in particular devised mechanical masks with movable parts to reveal a second facegenerally a human image. Believing that the human spirit could take animal form and vice versa, the makers of these masks fused man and bird or man and animal into one mask. Some of these articulating masks acted out entire legends as their parts moved.[Copyright1994-2002 Encyclopdia Britannica, Inc", "Document": "Zaid bin Khalid al-Juhani said :A man asked the Messenger of Allah (SWAS) about a find.

", "Generated_Answer": "<think>\nOkay, so I have a question about hanging African-style masks on the wall as decoration. I'm not sure if it's legal or if there are any issues with it. The user also mentioned that the masks can vary in detail—some are more stylized and others are more detailed. I need to figure out if it's permissible and whether the level of detail affects this.\n\nFirst, I think about cultural appropriation. I've heard that term before, where people from one culture adopt elements from another culture, sometimes without understanding or permission. So, is hanging a mask considered appropriation? Maybe, but I'm not entirely sure. I guess it depends on the context. If someone is doing it respectfully, maybe it's okay, but if they're using it without understanding its significance, that could be a problem.\n\nThen there's the legal aspect. The user asked if it's permissible, so I should consider if there are any laws against this. I know that some cultural items might be protected by laws, especially if they're considered sacred or have historical significance. For example, Native American artifacts in the U.S. have certain protections. But African masks—do they have similar laws? I'm not sure. Maybe it depends on the country of origin. Also, if the masks are replicas, that might be different from authentic, traditional masks.\n\nAnother angle is intellectual property. If the mask is a copy of a traditional design, does that infringe on anyone's rights? I don't think traditional designs are copyrighted, but maybe specific designs by known artists could be. So, if the mask is a unique piece created by an artist, there might be copyright issues. But if it's a generic style, maybe not.\n\nReligious or cultural significance is also important. Some masks are used in rituals or ceremonies and might be considered sacred. Hanging such a mask on a wall could be disrespectful, even if it's just as decoration. I should consider whether the mask has such significance. If it's more of a decorative piece without deep cultural meaning, maybe it's okay. But if it's a sacred object, that's different.\n\nThe level of detail might matter in a legal sense if a detailed mask is a reproduction of a specific, protected design. But in terms of cultural respect, maybe the detail isn't as important as the intent behind displaying it. If someone puts up a detailed mask without knowing its background, that could still be disrespectful, regardless of the detail level.\n\nI should also think about how to approach this respectfully.

Once he drew lots when he wanted to carry out a Ghazwa, and the lot came upon me. So I proceeded with Allahs Apostle after Allahs order of veiling (the women) had been revealed and thus I was carried in my howdah (on a camel) and dismounted while still in it. We carried on our journey, and when Allahs Apostle had finished his Ghazwa and returned and we approached Medina, Allahs Apostle ordered to proceed at night. When the army was ordered to resume the homeward journey, I got up and walked on till I left the army (camp) behind. When I had answered the call of nature, I went towards my howdah, but behold ! A necklace of mine made of Jaz Azfar (a kind of black bead) was broken and I looked for it and my search for it detained me. The group of people who used to carry me, came and carried my howdah on to the back of my camel on which I was riding, considering that I was therein. At that time women were light in weight and were not fleshy for they used to eat little (food), so those people did not feel the lightness of the howdah while raising it up, and I was still a young lady. They drove away the camel and proceeded. Then I found my necklace after the army had gone. I came to their camp but found nobody therein so I went to the place where I used to stay, thinking that they would miss me and come back in my search. While I was sitting at my place, I felt sleepy and slept. Safwan bin Al-Muattil As-Sulami Adh- Dhakw-ani was behind the army. He had started in the last part of the night and reached my stationing place in the morning and saw the figure of a sleeping person. He came to me and recognized me on seeing me for he used to see me before veiling. I got up because of his saying: \"Inna Li l-lahi wa inna ilaihi rajiun,\" which he uttered on recognizing me. I covered my face with my garment, and by Allah, he did not say to me a single word except, \"Inna Li l-lahi wa inna ilaihi rajiun,\" till he made his shecamel kneel down whereupon he trod on its forelegs and I mounted it. Then Safwan set out, leading the she-camel that was carrying me, till we met the army while they were resting during the hot midday. Then whoever was meant for destruction, fell in destruction, and the leader of the Ifk (forged statement) was `Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul. After this we arrived at Medina and I became ill for one month while the people were spreading the forged statements of the people of the Ifk, and I was not aware of anything thereof. But what aroused my doubt while I was sick, was that I was no longer receiving from Allahs Apostle the same kindness as I used to receive when I fell sick. Allahs Apostle would enter upon me, say a greeting and add, \"How is that (lady)?\" and then depart. That aroused my suspicion but I was not aware of the propagated evil till I recovered from my ailment. I went out with Um Mistah to answer the call of nature towards Al-Manasi, the place where we used to relieve ourselves, and used not to go out for this purpose except from night to night, and that was before we had lavatories close to our houses. And this habit of ours was similar to the habit of the old Arabs (in the deserts or in the tents) concerning the evacuation of the bowels, for we considered it troublesome and harmful to take lavatories in the houses. So I went out with Um Mistah who was the daughter of Abi Ruhm bin `Abd Manaf, and her mother was daughter of Sakhr bin Amir who was the aunt of Abi Bakr As-Siddiq, and her son was Mistah bin Uthatha. When we had finished our affair, Um Mistah and I came back towards my house. Um Mistah stumbled over her robe whereupon she said, \"Let Mistah be ruined ! \" I said to her, \"What a bad word you have said! Do you abuse a man who has taken part in the Battle of Badr? She said, \"O you there! Didnt you hear what he has said?\" I said, \"And what did he say?\" She then told me the statement of the people of the Ifk (forged statement) which added to my ailment. When I returned home, Allahs Apostle came to me, and after greeting, he said, \"How is that (lady)?\" I said, \"Will you allow me to go to my parents?\" At that time I intended to be sure of the news through them. Allahs Apostle allowed me and I went to my parents and asked my mother, \"O my mother! What are the people talking about?\" My mother said, \"O my daughter! Take it easy, for by Allah, there is no charming lady who is loved by her husband who has other wives as well, but that those wives would find fault with her.\" I said, \"Subhan Allah! Did the people really talk about that?\" That night I kept on weeping the whole night till the morning. My tears never stopped, nor did I sleep, and morning broke while I was still weeping, Allahs Apostle called `Ali bin Abi Talib and Usama bin Zaid when the Divine Inspiration delayed, in order to consult them as to the idea of divorcing his wife. Usama bin Zaid told Allahs Apostle of what he knew about the innocence of his wife and of his affection he kept for her. He said, \"O Allahs Apostle! She is your wife, and we do not know anything about her except good.\" But `Ali bin Abi Talib said, \"O Allahs Apostle! Allah does not impose restrictions on you; and there are plenty of women other than her. If you however, ask (her) slave girl, she will tell you the truth.\" `Aisha added: So Allahs Apostle called for Barira and said, \"O Barira! Did you ever see anything which might have aroused your suspicion? (as regards Aisha). Barira said, \"By Allah Who has sent you with the truth, I have never seen anything regarding Aisha which I would blame her for except that she is a girl of immature age who sometimes sleeps and leaves the dough of her family unprotected so that the domestic goats come and eat it.\" So Allahs Apostle got up (and addressed) the people an asked for somebody who would take revenge on `Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul then. Allahs Apostle, while on the pulpit, said, \"O Muslims! Who will help me against a man who has hurt me by slandering my family? By Allah, I know nothing except good about my family, and people have blamed a man of whom I know nothing except good, and he never used to visit my family except with me,\" Sa`d bin Mu`adh Al-Ansari got up and said, \"O Allahs Apostle! By Allah, I will relieve you from him. If he be from the tribe of (Bani) Al-Aus, then I will chop his head off; and if he be from our brethren, the Khazraj, then you give us your order and we will obey it.\" On that, Sa`d bin Ubada got up, and he was the chief of the Khazraj, and before this incident he had been a pious man but he was incited by his zeal for his tribe. He said to Sa`d (bin Mu`adh), \"By Allah the Eternal, you have told a lie! You shall not kill him and you will never be able to kill him!\" On that, Usaid bin Hudair, the cousin of Sa`d (bin Mu`adh) got up and said to Sa`d bin Ubada, \"You are a liar! By Allah the Eternal, we will surely kill him; and you are a hypocrite defending the hypocrites!\" So the two tribes of Al-Aus and Al-Khazraj got excited till they were on the point of fighting with each other while Allahs Apostle was standing on the pulpit. Allahs Apostle continued quietening them till they became silent whereupon he became silent too. On that day I kept on weeping so much that neither did my tears stop, nor could I sleep. In the morning my parents were with me, and I had wept for two nights and a day without sleeping and with incessant tears till they thought that my liver would burst with weeping. While they were with me and I was weeping, an Ansari woman asked permission to see me. I admitted her and she sat and started weeping with me. While I was in that state, Allahs Apostle came to us, greeted, and sat down,. He had never sat with me since the day what was said, was said. He had stayed a month without receiving any Divine Inspiration concerning my case. Allahs Apostle recited the Tashahhud after he had sat down, and then said, \"Thereafter, O `Aisha! I have been informed such and-such a thing about you; and if you are innocent, Allah will reveal your innocence, and if you have committed a sin, then ask for Allahs forgiveness and repent to Him, for when a slave confesses his sin and then repents to Allah, Allah accepts his repentance.\" When Allahs Apostle had finished his speech, my tears ceased completely so that I no longer felt even a drop thereof. Then I said to my father, \"Reply to Allahs Apostle on my behalf as to what he said.\" He said, \"By Allah, I do not know what to say to Allahs Apostle.\" Then I said to my mother, \"Reply to Allahs Apostle.\" She said, \"I do not know what to say to Allahs Apostle.\" Still a young girl as I was and though I had little knowledge of Quran, I said, \"By Allah, I know that you heard this story (of the Ifk) so much so that it has been planted in your minds and you have believed it. So now, if I tell you that I am innocent, and Allah knows that I am innocent, you will not believe me; and if I confess something, and Allah knows that I am innocent of it, you will believe me. By Allah, I cannot find of you an example except that of Josephs father: \"So (for me) patience is most fitting against that which you assert and it is Allah (Alone) Whose help can be sought. Then I turned away and lay on my bed, and at that time I knew that I was innocent and that Allah would reveal my innocence. But by Allah, I never thought that Allah would sent down about my affair, Divine Inspiration that would be recited (forever), as I considered myself too unworthy to be talked of by Allah with something that was to be recited: but I hoped that Allahs Apostle might have a vision in which Allah would prove my innocence. By Allah, Allahs Apostle had not left his seat and nobody had left the house when the Divine Inspiration came to Allahs Apostle . So there overtook him the same hard condition which used to overtake him (when he was Divinely Inspired) so that the drops of his sweat were running down, like pearls, though it was a (cold) winter day, and that was because of the heaviness of the Statement which was revealed to him. When that state of Allahs Apostle was over, and he was smiling when he was relieved, the first word he said was, \"Aisha, Allah has declared your innocence.\" My mother said to me, \"Get up and go to him.\" I said, \"By Allah, I will not go to him and I will not thank anybody but Allah.\" So Allah revealed: \"Verily! They who spread the Slander are a gang among you. Think it not....\" (24.11-20). When Allah revealed this to confirm my innocence, Abu Bakr As-Siddiq who used to provide for Mistah bin Uthatha because of the latters kinship to him and his poverty, said, \"By Allah, I will never provide for Mistah anything after what he has said about Aisha\". So Allah revealed: (continued...) (continuing... 1): -6.274:... ... \"Let not those among you who are good and are wealthy swear not to give (help) to their kinsmen, those in need, and those who have left their homes for Allahs Cause. Let them Pardon and forgive (i.e. do not punish them). Do you not love that should forgive you? Verily Allah is Oft-forgiving. Most Merciful.\" (24.22) Abu Bakr said, \"Yes, by Allah, I wish that Allah should forgive me.\" So he resumed giving Mistah the aid he used to give him before and said, \"By Allah, I will never withold it from him at all.\" Aisha further said: Allahs Apostle also asked Zainab bint Jahsh about my case. He said, \"O Zainab! What have you seen?\" She replied, \"O Allahs Apostle! I protect my hearing and my sight (by refraining from telling lies). I know nothing but good (about Aisha).\" Of all the wives of Allahs Apostle, it was Zainab who aspired to receive from him the same favor as I used to receive, yet, Allah saved her (from telling lies) because of her piety. But her sister, Hamna, kept on fighting on her behalf so she was destroyed as were those who invented and spread the slander.<D>Narrated Aisha:(the wife of the Prophet) \"Whenever Allahs Apostle intended to go on a journey, he would draw lots amongst his wives and would take with him the one upon whom the lot fell. During a Ghazwa of his, he drew lots amongst us and the lot fell upon me, and I proceeded with him after Allah had decreed the use of the veil by women. I was carried in a Howdah (on the camel) and dismounted while still in it. When Allahs Apostle was through with his Ghazwa and returned home, and we approached the city of Medina, Allahs Apostle ordered us to proceed at night. When the order of setting off was given, I walked till I was past the army to answer the call of nature. After finishing I returned (to the camp) to depart (with the others) and suddenly realized that my necklace over my chest was missing. So, I returned to look for it and was delayed because of that. The people who used to carry me on the camel, came to my Howdah and put it on the back of the camel, thinking that I was in it, as, at that time, women were light in weight, and thin and lean, and did not use to eat much. So, those people did not feel the difference in the heaviness of the Howdah while lifting it, and they put it over the camel. At that time I was a young lady. They set the camel moving and proceeded on. I found my necklace after the army had gone, and came to their camp to find nobody. So, I went to the place where I used to stay, thinking that they would discover my absence and come back in my search. While in that state, I felt sleepy and slept. Safwan bin Muattal As-Sulami Adh-Dhakwani was behind the army and reached my abode in the morning. When he saw a sleeping person, he came to me, and he used to see me before veiling. So, I got up when I heard him saying, \"Inna lil-lah-wa inn a ilaihi rajiun (We are for Allah, and we will return to Him).\" He made his camel knell down. He got down from his camel, and put his leg on the front legs of the camel and then I rode and sat over it. Safwan set out walking, leading the camel by the rope till we reached the army who had halted to take rest at midday. Then whoever was meant for destruction, fell into destruction, (some people accused me falsely) and the leader of the false accusers was `Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul. After that we returned to Medina, and I became ill for one month while the people were spreading the forged statements of the false accusers. I was feeling during my ailment as if I were not receiving the usual kindness from the Prophet which I used to receive from him when I got sick. But he would come, greet and say, How is that (girl)? I did not know anything of what was going on till I recovered from my ailment and went out with Um Mistah to the Manasi where we used to answer the call of nature, and we used not to go to answer the call of nature except from night to night and that was before we had lavatories near to our houses. And this habit of ours was similar to the habit of the old Arabs in the open country (or away from houses). So. I and Um Mistah bint Ruhm went out walking. Um Mistah stumbled because of her long dress and on that she said, Let Mistah be ruined. I said, You are saying a bad word. Why are you abusing a man who took part in (the battle of) Badr? She said, O Hanata (you there) didnt you hear what they said? Then she told me the rumors of the false accusers. My sickness was aggravated, and when I returned home, Allahs Apostle came to me, and after greeting he said, How is that (girl)? I requested him to allow me to go to my parents. I wanted then to be sure of the news through them I Allahs Apostle allowed me, and I went to my parents and asked my mother, What are the people talking about? She said, O my daughter! Dont worry much about this matter. By Allah, never is there a charming woman loved by her husband who has other wives, but the women would forge false news about her. I said, Glorified be Allah! Are the people really taking of this matter? That night I kept on weeping and could not sleep till morning. In the morning Allahs Apostle called `Ali bin Abu Talib and Usama bin Zaid when he saw the Divine Inspiration delayed, to consul them about divorcing his wife (i.e. `Aisha). Usama bin Zaid said what he knew of the good reputation of his wives and added, O Allahs Apostle! Keep you wife, for, by Allah, we know nothing about her but good. `Ali bin Abu Talib said, O Allahs Apostle! Allah has no imposed restrictions on you, and there are many women other than she, yet you may ask the woman-servant who will tell you the truth. On that Allahs Apostle called Buraira and said, O Burair. Did you ever see anything which roused your suspicions about her? Buraira said, No, by Allah Who has sent you with the Truth, I have never seen in her anything faulty except that she is a girl of immature age, who sometimes sleeps and leaves the dough for the goats to eat. On that day Allahs Apostle ascended the pulpit and requested that somebody support him in punishing `Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul. Allahs Apostle said, Who will support me to punish that person (`Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul) who has hurt me by slandering the reputation of my family? By Allah, I know nothing about my family but good, and they have accused a person about whom I know nothing except good, and he never entered my house except in my company. Sa`d bin Mu`adh got up and said, O Allahs Apostle! by Allah, I will relieve you from him. If that man is from the tribe of the Aus, then we will chop his head off, and if he is from our brothers, the Khazraj, then order us, and we will fulfill your order. On that Sa`d bin Ubada, the chief of the Khazraj and before this incident, he had been a pious man, got up, motivated by his zeal for his tribe and said, By Allah, you have told a lie; you cannot kill him, and you will never be able to kill him. On that Usaid bin Al-Hadir got up and said (to Sa`d bin Ubada), By Allah! you are a liar. By Allah, we will kill him; and you are a hypocrite, defending the hypocrites. On this the two tribes of Aus and Khazraj got excited and were about to fight each other, while Allahs Apostle was standing on the pulpit. He got down and quieted them till they became silent and he kept quiet. On that day I kept on weeping so much so that neither did my tears stop, nor could I sleep. In the morning my parents were with me and I had wept for two nights and a day, till I thought my liver would burst from weeping. While they were sitting with me and I was weeping, an Ansari woman asked my permission to enter, and I allowed her to come in. She sat down and started weeping with me. While we were in this state, Allahs Apostle came and sat down and he had never sat with me since the day they forged the accusation. No revelation regarding my case came to him for a month. He recited Tashah-hud (i.e. None has the right to be worshipped but Allah and Muhammad is His Apostle) and then said, O `Aisha! I have been informed such-and-such about you; if you are innocent, then Allah will soon reveal your innocence, and if you have committed a sin, then repent to Allah and ask Him to forgive you, for when a person confesses his sin and asks Allah for forgiveness, Allah accepts his repentance. When Allahs Apostle finished his speech my tears ceased completely and there remained not even a single drop of it. I requested my father to reply to Allahs Apostle on my behalf. My father said, By Allah, I do not know what to say to Allahs Apostle. I said to my mother, Talk to Allahs Apostle on my behalf. She said, By Allah, I do not know what to say to Allahs Apostle. I was a young girl and did not have much knowledge of the Quran. I said. I know, by Allah, that you have listened to what people are saying and that has been planted in your minds and you have taken it as a truth. Now, if I told you that I am innocent and Allah knows that I am innocent, you would not believe me and if I confessed to you falsely that I am guilty, and Allah knows that I am innocent you would believe me. By Allah, I dont compare my situation with you except to the situation of Josephs father (i.e. Jacob) who said, So (for me) patience is most fitting against that which you assert and it is Allah (Alone) whose help can be sought. Then I turned to the other side of my bed hoping that Allah would prove my innocence. By Allah I never thought that Allah would reveal Divine Inspiration in my case, as I considered myself too inferior to be talked of in the Holy Quran. I had hoped that Allahs Apostle might have a dream in which Allah would prove my innocence. By Allah, Allahs Apostle had not got up and nobody had left the house before the Divine Inspiration came to Allahs Apostle. So, there overtook him the same state which used to overtake him, (when he used to have, on being inspired divinely). He was sweating so much so that the drops of the sweat were dropping like pearls though it was a (cold) wintry day. When that state of Allahs Apostle was over, he was smiling and the first word he said, `Aisha! Thank Allah, for Allah has declared your innocence. My mother told me to go to Allahs Apostle . I replied, By Allah I will not go to him and will not thank but Allah. So Allah revealed: \"Verily! They who spread the slander are a gang among you . . .\" (24.11) When Allah gave the declaration of my Innocence, Abu Bakr, who used to provide for Mistah bin Uthatha for he was his relative, said, By Allah, I will never provide Mistah with anything because of what he said about Aisha. But Allah later revealed: -- \"And let not those who are good and wealthy among you swear not to help their kinsmen, those in need and those who left their homes in Allahs Cause. Let them forgive and overlook. Do you not wish that Allah should forgive you? Verily! Allah is Oft-forgiving, Most Merciful.\" (24.22) After that Abu Bakr said, Yes ! By Allah! I like that Allah should forgive me, and resumed helping Mistah whom he used to help before. Allahs Apostle also asked Zainab bint Jahsh (i.e. the Prophets wife about me saying, What do you know and what did you see? She replied, O Allahs Apostle! I refrain to claim hearing or seeing what I have not heard or seen. By Allah, I know nothing except goodness about Aisha.\" Aisha further added \"Zainab was competing with me (in her beauty and the Prophets love), yet Allah protected her (from being malicious), for she had piety.\"<D>Sufyan narrated from Amr bin Dinar that he heard Jabir bin Abdullah sayin:“We were in a battle” – Sufyan said: “They say in was the battle of Banu Mustaliq” – “Aman from the Muhajirin kicked a man from the Ansar. The man from the Muhajirin said: ‘O Muhajirin!’ the man from the Ansar said: ‘O Ansar!’ The Prophet heard that and said: ‘What is this evil call of Jahliyyah?’ They said: ‘A man from the Muhajirin kicked a man from the Ansar.’ So the Prophet said: ‘Leave that, for it is offensive.’ Abdullah bin Ubayy bin Salul heard that and said: ‘Did they really do that? By Allah! If we return to Al-Madinah indeed the more honorable will expel therefrom the meaner.’ Umar said: ‘Allow me to chop off the head of this hypocrite O Messenger of Allah!’ The Prophet said: ‘Leave him, I do not want the people to say that Muhammad kills his Companios.’” Someone other than Amr said: “So his son, Abdullah bin Abdullah, said: ‘By Allah! You shall not return until you say that you are the mean and that the Messenger of Allah is the honorable.’ So he did so.”<D>(Allah hath decreed: Lo! I verily shall conquer, I and My messengers) i.e. Muhammad (pbuh) they shall conquer Persia, Byzantium, the hypocrites and the Jews. (Lo! Allah is Strong) through giving help to his prophets, (Almighty) in retribution against His enemies. This was revealed about Abdullah Ibn Ubayy Ibn Salul who said to the true believers: Do you really think that you shall conquer Persia and Byzantium?.<D>(Thinketh he) does the disbelieving man think (that) because of his strength and force (none hath power over him?) i.e. Allah cannot seize and punish him.<D>(What then is your opinion of the Lord of the Worlds) what do you think He will do to you if you worship other than Him?", "Generated_Answer": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out why I feel this way. I have a good life—friends, family, looks, money, all that. But inside, I just can't feel satisfied. It's like nothing is ever enough. My mind keeps telling me I don't have real friends, and even small jokes from them can really upset me. I get stressed over little things, and I'm always thinking people are ignoring me. If two friends get closer and I'm not as involved, I feel like they don't care about me. Even something as trivial as seeing a friend's handwriting makes me feel like mine isn't good enough. I just can't find peace and always see myself as lesser than others.\n\nHmm, maybe I should start by understanding why I feel this way. I mean, I have all the things society says should make me happy, but they don't. So it's not about what I have, but how I feel about myself. I've heard about something called an inferiority complex. Is that what this is? It sounds like it because I'm always comparing myself unfavorably to others.\n\nWhy do I feel so insecure? Did something happen in my past that made me feel this way? Maybe I was criticized a lot as a child, or maybe I always felt like I wasn't good enough. Or perhaps it's just my personality—some people are more prone to negative thinking. I tend to overthink everything, especially social interactions. Every joke, every slight change in someone's behavior, and I'm analyzing it to death, always assuming the worst about myself.\n\nI also notice that I'm really sensitive to what others think of me. If a friend doesn't text me back immediately, I assume they're ignoring me or don't care. But maybe they're just busy. I don't give them the benefit of the doubt; instead, I jump straight to negative conclusions. That must be exhausting for me and possibly for them too.\n\nAnother thing is the comparison. I compare my handwriting, my looks, my social interactions—everything—to others, and I always come up short in my own mind. Social media doesn't help, right? Everyone posts their highlights, and I'm comparing my behind-the-scenes to their front stage. That's not fair to myself.\n\nI think part of the problem is that I don't acknowledge my own strengths and achievements. I downplay them or think they're not as good as others. Maybe I need to start recognizing what I'm good at and"}

The user mentioned they haven't been taking fresh water to wipe their head and were told by a Hanafi Shaykh that it's okay, inshaAllah. But they're unsure because they think at least one of their hands should have fresh water from running the faucet from the elbow to the hand and then wiping. \n\nFirst, I need to recall the basics of wudu in the Hanafi school. Wudu is the Islamic procedure for washing parts of the body, and it's a prerequisite for prayer. The key steps involve washing the face, arms, head, and feet. \n\nThe user is specifically concerned about the step where they wipe their head. They mentioned not taking fresh water for this part. In the Hanafi madhab, I remember that when performing masah (wiping) of the head, it's recommended to use water that's already been used for washing the arms. So, after washing the arms up to the elbows, the same water can be used to wipe the head. This is because the head is considered a noble part, and using the same water is seen as a sign of humility and not wasting water.\n\nThe user is confused because they think one of their hands should have fresh water from the faucet. Maybe they're under the impression that each part of wudu needs fresh water. But in the Hanafi view, once you've washed your arms, you can reuse that water for the head. This is different from other madhabs where they might require fresh water for each step.\n\nI should also consider the concept of \"mubika\" which refers to the water that has been used for washing. In Hanafi fiqh, using mubika water for the head is acceptable and even preferred because it's considered more modest and avoids excess. So, the Shaykh's advice aligns with this practice.\n\nHowever, the user is still unsure because they feel that at least one hand should have fresh water. Maybe they're thinking about the process of ensuring that the water is clean or perhaps confusing it with other parts of wudu. But in the Hanafi school, it's explicitly allowed to use the same water for the head after the arms.\n\nI should also check if there are any exceptions or specific conditions where fresh water is required. From what I know, as long as the water hasn't become impure or changed significantly in color or smell, it's permissible. So, if the water"}

I know that in many religions, there are rules about what you can and can't consume, but I'm not exactly sure about the specifics in Islam. I remember hearing that Muslims don't drink alcohol, but I'm not entirely clear on why or the details around that.\n\nFirst, I think about the Quran. I know the Quran is the holy book for Muslims, so maybe it has something to say about alcohol. I've heard of the word \"haram\" before, which means forbidden. So perhaps the Quran says alcohol is haram. But I'm not sure where exactly it says that or the context.\n\nI also remember something about a process where Muslims might have been allowed to drink something before, but then it was prohibited. Maybe like how in the Bible, there are rules that change over time? I'm not sure if that's the case with Islam too.\n\nThen there's the concept of \"khamr,\" which I think refers to intoxicants. I've heard that term before, but I'm not exactly sure how it's defined in Islamic law. Is it just alcohol, or does it include other substances? Maybe it's anything that intoxicates.\n\nI also wonder about the reasons behind the prohibition. In some religions, substances are forbidden because they can lead to negative behavior or harm. So maybe in Islam, alcohol is seen as something that can cause people to sin or make bad decisions. It might also be about maintaining a state of purity or mindfulness, especially for prayers and other religious duties.\n\nI'm also curious about the practical aspects. How do Muslims handle situations where alcohol is present, like at social gatherings or in certain cultures where it's common? Do they just avoid it, or are there specific rules about refusing it?\n\nAnother thought: what about medicines that contain alcohol? I know some medications use alcohol as an ingredient. Is there a different ruling for that? I think there might be some exceptions, but I'm not sure how that works in Islamic jurisprudence.\n\nI should also consider different interpretations. I know that Islamic scholarship can vary, so maybe not all scholars agree on every detail. But I think the general consensus is that alcohol is forbidden, but perhaps there are nuances.\n\nAdditionally, I recall that in some Islamic countries, there are strict laws against alcohol, while in others, it's more lenient. How does that tie into the religious teachings? Is it purely a religious matter, or is it also influenced by cultural"}

Let me start by recalling what I know about Islamic purification rituals. \n\nGhusl is the major ablution required for certain situations, like after menstruation, ejaculation, or after a person has died. It involves washing the entire body. Wudu is the minor ablution, done before prayer, and involves washing the face, arms, head, and feet. \n\nThe person in the question is talking about something they felt behind their ear during ghusl. They describe it as scratchable dots, possibly scabs. They scratched one and it smoothed out, but they're unsure if this affects their taharah, which is their state of purity. \n\nI remember that in Islamic jurisprudence, certain things can invalidate wudu or ghusl. For example, if something covers the parts that need to be washed, like a scab, it might prevent water from reaching the skin, thus making the ablution invalid. But I'm not entirely sure about the specifics.\n\nSo, the main issue here is whether scratching off a scab during ghusl affects the validity of the ablution. If the scab was covering a part of the skin, and the person removed it, does that mean the area wasn't properly washed before? Or does removing the scab during ghusl count as part of the washing process?\n\nI think that as long as the area was washed during ghusl, even if there was a scab that was later scratched off, the ghusl should still be valid. The key is whether the water reached the skin. If the scab was such that water couldn't reach through it, then the ghusl might be incomplete. But if the scab was minor and water could still reach the skin, or if the person washed the area properly, then it should be fine.\n\nAfter ghusl, when performing wudu, the same logic applies. If any part of the body that should be washed was covered and not reached by water, the wudu might be invalid. But if the scab was small and didn't prevent water from touching the skin, then it's okay.\n\nThe person is also asking if they need to do anything now, like repeating their ghusl or wudu. I think if they're uncertain, it's better to be cautious. They could choose to repeat their wudu just to be safe, but it"}

I've heard the term inferiority complex before, I think it's when someone feels they're not as good as others. Maybe they lack confidence or feel bad about themselves. So, how can they overcome this?\n\nFirst, I guess they should understand why they feel this way. Maybe it's from past experiences, like being criticized a lot or feeling left out. If they can identify the root cause, that might help them address it better. But how do they even start doing that? Maybe by reflecting on their past or talking to someone.\n\nThen, challenging negative thoughts comes to mind. If someone always thinks they're not good enough, maybe they can learn to question those thoughts. Like, are they really true? Or are they just being too hard on themselves? But how do you challenge those thoughts effectively? Maybe by writing them down and then countering them with positive affirmations.\n\nBuilding self-esteem seems important. I think setting small goals could help. If you achieve something, even if it's minor, it can boost your confidence. But what kind of goals? Maybe things like learning a new skill or completing a task they've been putting off. Celebrating these achievements, even small ones, might make a difference.\n\nSurrounding themselves with positive people sounds like good advice. If you're around people who support and encourage you, it can make a big difference. But what if their current friends or family are part of the problem? Maybe they need to seek out new supportive relationships or join groups where they feel accepted.\n\nProfessional help is another option. Therapists or counselors are trained to help with these issues. They can provide strategies and a safe space to talk. But some people might feel ashamed or hesitant to seek help. How can they overcome that barrier? Maybe by reminding themselves that seeking help is a sign of strength, not weakness.\n\nPracticing self-compassion is something I've heard about. Being kind to oneself, like how you'd treat a friend. It's easy to be hard on yourself, but if you can learn to be gentle and understanding, it might improve self-esteem. Mindfulness and meditation could help with that by making you more aware of your thoughts and feelings.\n\nFocusing on strengths is another point. Maybe they're so focused on their weaknesses that they forget their strengths. Making a list of positive qualities and accomplishments could remind them of their worth.

Moses said: These people have carried us without any charge and you attempt to break their boat so that the people sailing in the boat may drown. This is (something) grievous that you have done. He said: Did I not say that you would not bear with me? He said: Blame me not for what I forgot and be not hard upon what I did.

They've asked their question but are waiting for an answer, and in the meantime, they're wondering if they should proceed with their prayer as if the water reached the skin or wait until they know for sure.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the basics of wudoo. Wudoo is a state of purification required for prayer, and it involves washing specific parts of the body. The key here is ensuring that the water reaches the skin, as that's essential for the validity of wudoo.\n\nThe user is concerned about dead skin. If the dead skin is unattached, does it act as a barrier? In Islamic jurisprudence, the general rule is that anything covering the skin that prevents water from reaching it would invalidate wudoo. So, if dead skin is like a thick layer that water can't penetrate, it might be a problem. But if it's just loose and water can still reach the skin, then it's probably fine.\n\nNow, the user is unsure about this detail. They've asked the question but are waiting for the answer. In the meantime, they need to decide whether to proceed with their prayer or wait. The Islamic principle here is about acting on certainty. If someone is unsure about whether their wudoo is valid, they should act based on what they're certain about.\n\nSo, if they're unsure whether the water reached their skin because of the dead skin, they should try to resolve that uncertainty. They might do this by checking if the dead skin is loose and whether water can still reach the underlying skin. If they're still unsure, they should err on the side of caution. That might mean redoing the wudoo to ensure it's valid before praying.\n\nAlternatively, if they decide that the dead skin isn't a barrier, they can proceed, but they should be as certain as possible. It's also important to remember that seeking knowledge is part of the process, so they should continue to learn and clarify their doubts.\n\nIn summary, when in doubt about such details, the person should seek to clarify their uncertainty, possibly by checking the condition of the skin and ensuring water can reach it. If they're still unsure, they should take the safer option to maintain the validity of"}

Let him create an atom or a grain of wheat or that of barley. This hadith has been transmitted on the authority of Abu Zura and he said: Abu Huraira went to the house of Sald or Marwan which they had built in Medina and he (Abu Huraira) saw a painter who had been painting pictures in his house, whereupon he told that Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) had said like this, but he made no mention of the words:\" Let him create the grain of barley.\"<D>Narrated Samura bin Jundab:Whenever the Prophet finished the (morning) prayer, he would face us and ask, \"Who amongst you had a dream last night?\" So if anyone had seen a dream he would narrate it. The Prophet would say: \"Ma shaa-llah\" (An Arabic maxim meaning literally, What Allah wished, and it indicates a good omen.) One day, he asked us whether anyone of us had seen a dream. We replied in the negative. The Prophet said, \"But I had seen (a dream) last night that two men came to me, caught hold of my hands, and took me to the Sacred Land (Jerusalem). There, I saw a person sitting and another standing with an iron hook in his hand pushing it inside the mouth of the former till it reached the jawbone, and then tore off one side of his cheek, and then did the same with the other side; in the meantime the first side of his cheek became normal again and then he repeated the same operation again. I said, What is this? They told me to proceed on and we went on till we came to a man Lying flat on his back, and another man standing at his head carrying a stone or a piece of rock, and crushing the head of the Lying man, with that stone. Whenever he struck him, the stone rolled away. The man went to pick it up and by the time he returned to him, the crushed head had returned to its normal state and the man came back and struck him again (and so on). I said, Who is this? They told me to proceed on; so we proceeded on and passed by a hole like an oven; with a narrow top and wide bottom, and the fire was kindling underneath that hole. Whenever the fire-flame went up, the people were lifted up to such an extent that they about to get out of it, and whenever the fire got quieter, the people went down into it, and there were naked men and women in it. I said, Who is this? They told me to proceed on. So we proceeded on till we reached a river of blood and a man was in it, and another man was standing at its bank with stones in front of him, facing the man standing in the river. Whenever the man in the river wanted to come out, the other one threw a stone in his mouth and caused him to retreat to his original position; and so whenever he wanted to come out the other would throw a stone in his mouth, and he would retreat to his original position. I asked, What is this? They told me to proceed on and we did so till we reached a well-flourished green garden having a huge tree and near its root was sitting an old man with some children. (I saw) Another man near the tree with fire in front of him and he was kindling it up. Then they (i.e. my two companions) made me climb up the tree and made me enter a house, better than which I have ever seen. In it were some old men and young men, women and children. Then they took me out of this house and made me climb up the tree and made me enter another house that was better and superior (to the first) containing old and young people. I said to them (i.e. my two companions), You have made me ramble all the night. Tell me all about that I have seen. They said, Yes. As for the one whose cheek you saw being torn away, he was a liar and he used to tell lies, and the people would report those lies on his authority till they spread all over the world. So, he will be punished like that till the Day of Resurrection. The one whose head you saw being crushed is the one whom Allah had given the knowledge of Quran (i.e. knowing it by heart) but he used to sleep at night (i.e. he did not recite it then) and did not use to act upon it (i.e. upon its orders etc.) by day; and so this punishment will go on till the Day of Resurrection. And those you saw in the hole (like oven) were adulterers (those men and women who commit illegal sexual intercourse). And those you saw in the river of blood were those dealing in Riba (usury). And the old man who was sitting at the base of the tree was Abraham and the little children around him were the offspring of the people. And the one who was kindling the fire was Malik, the gatekeeper of the Hell-fire. And the first house in which you have gone was the house of the common believers, and the second house was of the martyrs. I am Gabriel and this is Michael. Raise your head. I raised my head and saw a thing like a cloud over me. They said, That is your place. I said, Let me enter my place.

They're asking if it's alright to move in and read prayers there. Hmm, that's an interesting situation. I need to figure out how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I should think about the main concerns here. The house's history with the previous tenants might be making them uncomfortable. They might be worried about the spiritual or moral implications of living in a place where such activities took place. So, I need to address both the practical and the spiritual aspects.\n\nFrom a practical standpoint, the history of the house doesn't necessarily affect its current state. If the house is in good condition and the location is convenient, those are positive factors. Maybe the previous activities don't have any bearing on the present. But I can understand that knowing such a history could make someone feel uneasy or uncomfortable.\n\nOn the spiritual side, many religions teach that a place's history doesn't inherently make it impure. It's more about how the current inhabitants use the space. If they move in with good intentions and create a positive environment, that could counter any negative vibes. Reading prayers could be a way to cleanse the space spiritually, which is a common practice in many faiths.\n\nI should also consider if there are any cultural or religious guidelines about moving into a place with such a history. For example, some religions might have specific rituals or prayers for cleansing a space. It might be helpful to suggest consulting with a religious leader or performing a cleansing ritual if that's part of their tradition.\n\nAnother angle is the legal and ethical aspect. As long as the house is legally available for rent and there are no ongoing illegal activities, there shouldn't be a problem. The previous tenants' actions don't reflect on the current renters unless those activities are continuing, which they aren't in this case.\n\nI should also think about the emotional impact. If the knowledge of the house's past makes them uncomfortable, it might affect their well-being. In that case, maybe it's worth considering whether the emotional peace is more important than the practical aspects. But if they can overlook the history and feel at peace, then it might be a good move.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer should address both the practical aspects (condition, location) and the spiritual (cleansing through prayer, intentions). It should also touch on seeking guidance if needed and considering personal comfort levels.\n</think>\n\nMoving into a house with a history"}

I've heard that these can range from R1000 to over R10000 a bottle, which seems like a significant amount. I'm not entirely sure what the Islamic stance is on spending large amounts on luxury items, so I need to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that Islam encourages moderation in spending. The Quran mentions not to be extravagant, like in Surah Isra, verse 29, where it says not to throw your wealth away. So, spending a lot on something like perfume might be considered wasteful if it's not serving a necessary purpose.\n\nI also recall that the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) emphasized being content with what you have and not overspending on things that aren't essential. He himself lived a simple life, so maybe that's a hint that one shouldn't indulge too much in luxuries.\n\nBut then, using perfume is actually recommended in Islam. The Prophet was known to love perfume and would use it regularly. So, there's a positive aspect to using attar. However, the issue arises when the spending becomes excessive. If someone is buying expensive attar just to show off or because they're attached to luxury, that might not align with Islamic values.\n\nI'm thinking about the concept of 'israf' in Islam, which means wastefulness or extravagance. Spending a large amount on a small bottle of perfume could be seen as israf, especially if that money could be better spent on more essential things or helping others.\n\nOn the other hand, if someone genuinely appreciates the quality and craftsmanship of the attar and uses it in moderation, maybe it's permissible. It's about the intention behind the purchase. If it's for personal enjoyment without wastefulness, it might be okay. But if it's just to flaunt wealth, then it's not.\n\nI also wonder about the broader implications. If spending so much on attar prevents someone from fulfilling other obligations, like paying off debt, supporting family, or giving charity, then it's definitely problematic. Islam teaches about prioritizing responsibilities and not letting personal indulgences get in the way.\n\nAnother angle is considering the value the attar brings. If it's a high-quality product that lasts a long time, maybe it's worth the investment. But if it's just a small quantity and the price is inflated, then it"}

The man said, \"I have a Jadhaa which is to me better than two sheep.\" The Prophet allowed him (to slaughter it as a sacrifice).

So, I need to find out where music stands in this.\n\nI remember hearing that some Muslims say music is Haram, while others enjoy it. That makes me think that maybe it's not a clear-cut issue. Perhaps it depends on the type of music or the context in which it's played.\n\nI should consider the sources of Islamic law: the Quran, Hadith (sayings and actions of the Prophet Muhammad), and scholarly interpretations. Let me think about any specific verses in the Quran that mention music. I can't recall any direct verses about music, but there are mentions of singing and reciting the Quran, which are definitely allowed and even encouraged.\n\nWait, the Quran itself is often recited melodiously, so that's a form of music. So, maybe music in itself isn't forbidden. But perhaps certain types of music or the way it's used might be problematic.\n\nLooking at Hadiths, I think there are some that prohibit musical instruments. For example, the Prophet Muhammad is reported to have said that musical instruments are the devil's tools. But I'm not sure if all instruments are forbidden or just certain ones, or if it's about the context.\n\nI also remember that in some cultures, Islamic scholars have different opinions. Some say that only certain instruments are allowed, like the Duff (a type of drum), while others are not. So maybe it's about the instrument and the purpose of the music.\n\nAnother angle is the concept of Maqasid al-Sharia, which looks at the intentions and outcomes. If music leads to Haram activities or distracts from worship, it might be discouraged. But if it's used for positive purposes, like praising Allah or promoting unity, it could be acceptable.\n\nI should also consider the companions of the Prophet. I think some of them, like Aisha, were known to have musical instruments. So maybe in the early days of Islam, music was allowed in certain forms.\n\nI also wonder about the difference between vocal music and instrumental music. Some scholars might allow singing without instruments, especially if the lyrics are religious or positive.

Fatiha is the first chapter of the Quran, so maybe the user is talking about food distributed after a recitation of Fatiha, perhaps at a gathering or ceremony.

Let me try to understand the situation step by step.\n\nFirst, the user bought the house in 2006 with her brother. The house has two floors. The first floor has three bedrooms, a living room, and a kitchen. The second floor has two bedrooms, a living room, and a kitchen. She wants her brother to move to the second floor so she can have the three bedrooms on the first floor for her kids. Her son is 17 and daughter is 13, so they need separate rooms. Her brother has a 9-year-old son and a 7-year-old daughter.\n\nThey've been sharing the house expenses equally for the past eight years. She asked her brother to sell the house, but he's not willing to do that, nor is he willing to move to the second floor. Now, she's facing issues because the house papers aren't in her name—some papers are missing, and she's in New York, so maybe the legal process is complicated there.\n\nShe’s asking for a solution, maybe a legal procedure or something, to get the house sold or to get her name on the papers.\n\nSo, I need to figure out possible steps she can take. Let me think about the legal aspects here.\n\n1. **Ownership Clarification**: Since the house was bought in 2006, but her name isn't on the papers, she needs to establish her ownership. Maybe they had an agreement when they bought it together, but it's not legally documented. She should find any proof of their joint ownership, like bank statements showing equal payments, or any contracts they signed when purchasing the house.\n\n2. **Legal Advice**: She should consult a real estate lawyer, especially one familiar with New York laws, since that's where the property is. The lawyer can help her understand her rights and the process to get her name on the deed.\n\n3. **Mediation**: Before going to court, maybe mediation could help. A neutral third party can help them negotiate an agreement without legal battles.\n\n4. **Partition Action**: If her brother refuses to sell or move, she might have to file a partition action. This is a legal process where the court can order the sale of the property and split the proceeds. But this can be lengthy and costly.\n\n5. **Offering Incentives**: She could offer her brother a larger share of the sale if he agrees to sell, or maybe she"}

It's making my clothes all moist and smelly, like stool. I'm really confused about how to handle this in terms of my Islamic practices, especially regarding purification (taharah) and prayer (salaah). I need to figure out what this fluid is, how to deal with it, and how to perform my prayers properly.\n\nFirst, I think I should understand what this fluid might be. It's coming from the same passage as stool, so maybe it's related to the digestive system. It's thin and I don't feel it when it comes out, which is weird. It smells like stool, so it's probably some kind of discharge. Maybe it's mucus or something else. I should look up possible medical conditions that cause such symptoms. Maybe it's something like anal fistula, hemorrhoids, or maybe an infection. But I'm not a doctor, so I can't be sure.\n\nNext, I need to think about how this affects my taharah. In Islam, certain discharges can invalidate wudu (ablution). So, if this fluid is considered impure, I might need to perform wudu again each time it happens. But I don't know if this fluid is considered najis (impure). I remember that urine, stool, and blood are najis, but I'm not sure about other discharges. I should check some Islamic rulings on this.\n\nI also need to figure out how to manage this during prayer. If the fluid comes out while I'm praying, does that break my wudu? If it does, I might need to excuse myself to refresh my wudu, but I don't know if that's possible during prayer. Maybe I can take precautions before praying, like using protective garments or ensuring I'm completely clean before starting.\n\nAnother thing is the smell. Even after cleaning myself (istinja), the smell remains. This could be embarrassing, especially in public or at the mosque. I need a way to eliminate the odor or at least reduce it. Maybe using certain cleaning products or wearing specific types of underwear could help.\n\nI should also consider consulting a doctor to get a proper diagnosis. If it's a medical issue, treating it might solve the problem from the root. But in the meantime, I need some practical steps to manage it according to Islamic guidelines.\n\nI remember that in Islamic jurisprudence, there are rules about"}

I remember that Ihram is a state of consecration for Muslims during Hajj or Umrah, so there are certain rules they have to follow.\n\nFirst, I think about the purpose of Ihram. It's a time when pilgrims are supposed to focus on their spiritual rituals and avoid certain worldly comforts. This includes things like perfume, because the idea is to be humble and not attract attention with scents. So, using fragrant items might be restricted.\n\nNow, toothpaste. I know some toothpastes have flavors, like mint, which could be considered fragrant. But I also remember that basic hygiene is important, and Islam emphasizes cleanliness. So maybe toothpaste is allowed as long as it's not perfumed. But I'm not sure if even mint-flavored toothpaste counts as fragrance. I need to check that.\n\nMint sweets are another thing. They are meant to freshen breath, so they have a strong mint scent. If the rule is against anything fragrant, then mint sweets might not be allowed. But I'm not certain if it's the intention behind using them that matters. Like, if someone uses them just to freshen their mouth without the intention of perfume, maybe it's permissible. Or maybe it's still not allowed because they do have a fragrance.\n\nThen, any food that's meant for a fragrant smell. So, like foods with strong scents such as garlic or onions. I'm not sure if these are prohibited in Ihram. I think the main issue is with intentional use of perfume, but maybe strong-smelling foods are okay as long as they're not used for fragrance. But I'm not sure how that's viewed in Islamic law.\n\nI also recall that in Ihram, certain things are prohibited, like hunting and wearing perfumes. But I'm not clear on the specifics of toothpaste and mints. Maybe there's a difference between using something for its functional purpose (like cleaning teeth) versus using it for its scent.\n\nI should also consider that different scholars might have different opinions. Some might be stricter and say that any fragrance, even from toothpaste, is not allowed. Others might allow it if it's necessary for hygiene and not for the sake of perfume.\n\nI think the safest approach is to use unscented toothpaste and avoid mint sweets and fragrant foods to stay on the safe side"}

I know zakat is a form of charity in Islam, and it's one of the Five Pillars. But I'm not entirely sure how it applies to jewelry. Let me think through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that zakat is usually calculated on certain types of wealth, like money, gold, silver, and other precious items. I think the general rule is that if someone has wealth above a certain threshold, called nisab, they have to pay zakat. For gold and silver, the nisab is pretty specific—like 87.48 grams for gold and 612.36 grams for silver. If you have more than that, you pay 2.5% as zakat.\n\nNow, jewelry... I know that some scholars say that jewelry is considered an ornament and not a form of wealth that's subject to zakat. But others might disagree, especially if the jewelry is made of gold or silver. So maybe the type of jewelry matters. If it's just for decoration and not meant to be a store of value, maybe it's exempt. But if it's a significant amount of gold or silver, perhaps it should be included.\n\nWait, but I also heard that women are allowed to wear jewelry without it being considered as zakatable because it's for personal use. But then again, if the jewelry is so valuable that it's beyond what's considered normal for personal use, maybe it should be counted. So maybe the intention behind having the jewelry plays a role. If it's just for wearing, then no zakat. If it's kept as an investment, then yes.\n\nI'm also thinking about how different scholars might have different opinions. Some might be stricter and say any gold or silver, regardless of use, is subject to zakat. Others might be more lenient and only tax it if it's kept as a store of value. So it might depend on the scholar or the school of thought one follows.\n\nAnother angle: zakat is about excess wealth. So if the jewelry is something that's used and not just hoarded, maybe it's not counted. But if someone has a lot of jewelry that they're not using, just keeping it as an investment, then maybe it should be included.\n\nAlso, I remember reading that some scholars consider the nisab for jewelry separately, but I'm not sure how that works. Maybe it's the same as for gold"}

The person is asking if it's permissible to use the meat from sadaqa given to a madrasa for orphan Quran students in meelaad sharif programs, where it might be eaten by rich people. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the terms. Sadaqa is a form of charity in Islam, which is recommended but not obligatory like Zakat. It's any act of kindness or charity. A madrasa is an Islamic school, and in this case, it's for orphan students who are learning the Quran. Meelaad sharif is a celebration commemorating the birth of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him), often involving gatherings, food, and sometimes distribution of food or sweets.\n\nSo the question is about whether the meat donated as sadaqa to the madrasa can be used in these meelaad events, especially if wealthy individuals end up consuming it. I know that in Islam, charity is supposed to benefit those in need, so I need to consider the intentions and the distribution.\n\nI remember that sadaqa can be given in various forms, including food and money. The key points are the intention (niyyah) behind the charity and ensuring that it reaches those who are most in need. If the meat is given to the madrasa for the orphan students, then using it for their needs would be appropriate. However, using it for events where it might be consumed by rich people might not align with the intended purpose.\n\nBut wait, meelaad sharif is a religious gathering. If the event is organized by the madrasa and the food is shared with the students and perhaps the community, including both rich and poor, that might be acceptable as long as the primary beneficiaries are the orphans. The Prophet (peace be upon him) encouraged feeding others and doing good deeds, so as long as the sadaqa isn't being misused or diverted to those who don't need it, it could be permissible.\n\nI also need to consider if there's any specific Islamic ruling about using sadaqa for such events. I think as long as the sadaqa is used in a way that benefits the community and upholds the intention of charity, it's acceptable. However, if the sadaqa is specifically meant for the orphan students, then using it for other purposes, especially if it doesn't benefit the students, might not be appropriate.\n\nAnother angle is that if the"}

He (Al Mughriah) struck his (‘Urwah’s) hand with the lower end of his sheath, and said: Keep away your hand from his beard. ‘Urwah then raised his hand and asked: Who is this? They replied: Al-Mughirah bin Shu’bah. He said: O treacherous one! Did I not use my offices in your treachery? In pre-Islamic days Al-Mughirah bin Shu’bah accompanied some people and murdered them, and took their property. He then came (to the Prophet) and embraced Islam. The Prophet () said: As for Islam we accepted it, but as to the property, as it has been taken by treachery, we have no need of it. He went on with the tradition the Prophet () said: Write down: This is what Muhammad, the Messenger of Allah, has decided. He then narrated the tradition. Suhail then said: And that a man will not come to you from us, even if he follows your religion, without you sending him back to us. When he finished drawing up the document, the Prophet () said to his Companions: Get up and sacrifice and then shave. Thereafter some believing women who were immigrants came. (Allah sent down: O yea who believe, when believing women come to you as emigrants). Allah most high forbade them to send them back, but ordered them to restore the dower. He then returned to Medina. Abu Basir a man from the Quraish (who was a Muslim), came to him. And they sent (two men) to look for him; so he handed him over to the two men. They took him away, and when they reached Dhu Al Hulaifah and alighted to eat some dates which they had, Abu Basir said to one of the men : I swear by Allah so-and-so, that I think this sword of yours is a fine one; the other drew the sword and said : Yes I have tried it. Abu Basir said: Let me look at it. He let him have it and he struck him till he died, whereupon the other fled and came to Medina, and running entered the mosque. The Prophet ( may peace be upon him) said: This man has seen something frightful. He said: I swear by Allah that my Companion has been killed, and im as good as dead. Abu Basir then arrived and said: Allah has fulfilled your covenant. You returned me to them, but Allah saved me from them. The Prophet () said: Woe to his mother, stirrer up of war! Would that he had someone (i.e. some kinsfolk). When he heard that he knew that he would send him back to them, so he went out and came to the seashore. Abu Jandal escaped and joined Abu Basir till a band of them collected.<D>It was narrated from Abu Hurairah that the Messenger of Allah () said:\"On the night in which I was taken on the Night Journey (Al-Isra), I came to people whose stomachs were like houses, in which there were snakes that could be seen from outside their stomachs. I said: Who are these, O Jibra’il?’ He said: They are the ones who consumed usury.\"<D>(He said) Lot said within himself: (Would that I had strength) physical strength and sons to help me (toresist you or had some strong support (among you)!) or that I could rely on a strong clan such that I defend myself from you.<D>(When He made the slumber fall upon you) when He cast sleepiness upon you (as a reassurance) to you (from Him) from Allah against the enemy; and this is a favour from Allah towards you (and sent down water) rain (from the sky upon you, that thereby He might purify you) with rain from physical and minor and major ritual impurities, (and remove from you the fear of Satan) the whispering of Satan, (and make strong your hearts) and preserve your hearts with steadfastness (and firm) by means of the rain ((your) feet thereby) on the sand, i.e. He gathers the sand such that feet become firm on it.<D>(Have they not travelled in the land) have the people of Mecca not travelled for their trade, (and have they hearts wherewith to feel) fear and that which was done to others upon beholding and reflecting (and ears wherewith to hear) the Truth and threats?

Also, I need to consider if intention affects this. Plus, I have to think about whether reading fictional novels is acceptable as a hobby or to pass time.\n\nStarting with physical activities. I know that in Islam, taking care of one's health is important. The Prophet (peace be upon him) encouraged physical activities. So maybe things like running or playing sports are permissible. But I'm not sure if there are any restrictions. Maybe if the activity involves mixing genders or inappropriate dress, that could be an issue. Also, if someone is doing it just for fun versus seeking health, does that matter? I think intention might play a role in how the activity is viewed. If the intention is to maintain health, it's better, but if it's just for leisure without a bad intention, it might still be okay.\n\nNow, about reading fictional novels. I remember that some scholars say that what you read should be beneficial. Fiction can be a waste of time if it's not educational or if it distracts from more important things. But if someone reads it just to relax and it doesn't lead them away from their duties, maybe it's permissible. But I'm not sure if the Hanafi madhab has specific rulings on this. Maybe it's more about the content of the novel. If it's clean and doesn't promote haram things, then it's acceptable as a hobby.\n\nI should also think about the concept of 'ibadah. If the activity is done with the intention of pleasing Allah, like exercising to stay healthy to perform religious duties better, then it's considered an act of worship. Similarly, reading with the intention to gain knowledge or relax in a permissible way could be seen positively.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure about the specifics. Maybe in the Hanafi school, as long as the activity doesn't involve anything haram, like mixing genders or exposing oneself, it's allowed. And the intention does influence whether it's considered a good deed or just a neutral act.\n\nI should also consider if there are any hadiths or verses that talk about physical activities or leisure. The Prophet (peace be upon him) was known to race with his wife, Aisha, so that indicates that such activities are permissible. For reading, the Quran encourages seeking knowledge, but fiction isn't directly addressed. So maybe it's about the content and the intention behind reading.\n\nIn summary, physical activities"}
{"Question": "Answered by Shaykh Ilyas PatelI have a huge problem concerning brotherhood in Islam. I started practicing in my teen years and day by day MashAllah my deen goes up. I just found out that a brother I know for long time is talking behind my back and he and some other people judge for the way I dress, walk, and talk. They are always trying to bring me down. In fact it seems they hate me deep inside just because the way I am. I feel depressed and it hurts me, brothers judging other brothers outwardly. What should I do? And what does Islam say about backbiting.? --T--", "Answer": "In the Name of Allah, Most Merciful and CompassionateThese brothers who are judging you outwardly is because of their lack of iman and understanding, though they know it is wrong to backbite. They havent come to realise its severity. It is good of you being concerned and wanting them to like you as you are, but this is not the case all the time. You can be judged wrongly even if you are like them. Try to dress in western clothing also and be as normal as you are, in order to show your friends that you are no different when you wear what they are wearing. Also a good way to make them closer is to give gifts. On the other hand, if they are completely off the track and affecting your din then you should try to avoid them and pray to Allah to guide them and keep you steadfast, but keep ties with them by meeting them occasionally or by giving gifts.Ghiba (Backbiting and slander) is a major sin and is a very common ailment in our society. It means to mention anything concerning a person that he would dislike, whether about his body, religion, everyday life, self, disposition, property, son, father, wife, servant, turban, garment, gait Allah clearly mentions in the Quran:Woe to whoever disparages others behind their back or to their face(Koran 104:1)There are other verses and ahadith against backbiting.May Allah save us all from this evil, amin", "Document": "Narrated Aisha:(The wife of the Prophet) Whenever Allahs Apostle intended to go on a journey, he used to draw lots among his wives and would take with him the one on whom the lot had fallen. Once he drew lots when he wanted to carry out a Ghazwa, and the lot came upon me. So I proceeded with Allahs Apostle after Allahs order of veiling (the women) had been revealed and thus I was carried in my howdah (on a camel) and dismounted while still in it. We carried on our journey, and when Allahs Apostle had finished his Ghazwa and returned and we approached Medina, Allahs Apostle ordered to proceed at night. When the army was ordered to resume the homeward journey, I got up and walked on till I left the army (camp) behind. When I had answered the call of nature, I went towards my howdah, but behold ! A necklace of mine made of Jaz Azfar (a kind of black bead) was broken and I looked for it and my search for it detained me. The group of people who used to carry me, came and carried my howdah on to the back of my camel on which I was riding, considering that I was therein. At that time women were light in weight and were not fleshy for they used to eat little (food), so those people did not feel the lightness of the howdah while raising it up, and I was still a young lady. They drove away the camel and proceeded. Then I found my necklace after the army had gone. I came to their camp but found nobody therein so I went to the place where I used to stay, thinking that they would miss me and come back in my search. While I was sitting at my place, I felt sleepy and slept. Safwan bin Al-Muattil As-Sulami Adh- Dhakw-ani was behind the army. He had started in the last part of the night and reached my stationing place in the morning and saw the figure of a sleeping person. He came to me and recognized me on seeing me for he used to see me before veiling. I got up because of his saying: \"Inna Li l-lahi wa inna ilaihi rajiun,\" which he uttered on recognizing me. I covered my face with my garment, and by Allah, he did not say to me a single word except, \"Inna Li l-lahi wa inna ilaihi rajiun,\" till he made his shecamel kneel down whereupon he trod on its forelegs and I mounted it. Then Safwan set out, leading the she-camel that was carrying me, till we met the army while they were resting during the hot midday. Then whoever was meant for destruction, fell in destruction, and the leader of the Ifk (forged statement) was `Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul. After this we arrived at Medina and I became ill for one month while the people were spreading the forged statements of the people of the Ifk, and I was not aware of anything thereof. But what aroused my doubt while I was sick, was that I was no longer receiving from Allahs Apostle the same kindness as I used to receive when I fell sick. Allahs Apostle would enter upon me, say a greeting and add, \"How is that (lady)?\" and then depart. That aroused my suspicion but I was not aware of the propagated evil till I recovered from my ailment. I went out with Um Mistah to answer the call of nature towards Al-Manasi, the place where we used to relieve ourselves, and used not to go out for this purpose except from night to night, and that was before we had lavatories close to our houses. And this habit of ours was similar to the habit of the old Arabs (in the deserts or in the tents) concerning the evacuation of the bowels, for we considered it troublesome and harmful to take lavatories in the houses. So I went out with Um Mistah who was the daughter of Abi Ruhm bin `Abd Manaf, and her mother was daughter of Sakhr bin Amir who was the aunt of Abi Bakr As-Siddiq, and her son was Mistah bin Uthatha. When we had finished our affair, Um Mistah and I came back towards my house. Um Mistah stumbled over her robe whereupon she said, \"Let Mistah be ruined ! \" I said to her, \"What a bad word you have said! Do you abuse a man who has taken part in the Battle of Badr? She said, \"O you there! Didnt you hear what he has said?\" I said, \"And what did he say?\" She then told me the statement of the people of the Ifk (forged statement) which added to my ailment. When I returned home, Allahs Apostle came to me, and after greeting, he said, \"How is that (lady)?\" I said, \"Will you allow me to go to my parents?\" At that time I intended to be sure of the news through them. Allahs Apostle allowed me and I went to my parents and asked my mother, \"O my mother! What are the people talking about?\" My mother said, \"O my daughter! Take it easy, for by Allah, there is no charming lady who is loved by her husband who has other wives as well, but that those wives would find fault with her.\" I said, \"Subhan Allah! Did the people really talk about that?\" That night I kept on weeping the whole night till the morning. My tears never stopped, nor did I sleep, and morning broke while I was still weeping, Allahs Apostle called `Ali bin Abi Talib and Usama bin Zaid when the Divine Inspiration delayed, in order to consult them as to the idea of divorcing his wife. Usama bin Zaid told Allahs Apostle of what he knew about the innocence of his wife and of his affection he kept for her. He said, \"O Allahs Apostle! She is your wife, and we do not know anything about her except good.\" But `Ali bin Abi Talib said, \"O Allahs Apostle! Allah does not impose restrictions on you; and there are plenty of women other than her. If you however, ask (her) slave girl, she will tell you the truth.\" `Aisha added: So Allahs Apostle called for Barira and said, \"O Barira! Did you ever see anything which might have aroused your suspicion? (as regards Aisha). Barira said, \"By Allah Who has sent you with the truth, I have never seen anything regarding Aisha which I would blame her for except that she is a girl of immature age who sometimes sleeps and leaves the dough of her family unprotected so that the domestic goats come and eat it.\" So Allahs Apostle got up (and addressed) the people an asked for somebody who would take revenge on `Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul then. Allahs Apostle, while on the pulpit, said, \"O Muslims! Who will help me against a man who has hurt me by slandering my family? By Allah, I know nothing except good about my family, and people have blamed a man of whom I know nothing except good, and he never used to visit my family except with me,\" Sa`d bin Mu`adh Al-Ansari got up and said, \"O Allahs Apostle! By Allah, I will relieve you from him. If he be from the tribe of (Bani) Al-Aus, then I will chop his head off; and if he be from our brethren, the Khazraj, then you give us your order and we will obey it.\" On that, Sa`d bin Ubada got up, and he was the chief of the Khazraj, and before this incident he had been a pious man but he was incited by his zeal for his tribe. He said to Sa`d (bin Mu`adh), \"By Allah the Eternal, you have told a lie! You shall not kill him and you will never be able to kill him!\" On that, Usaid bin Hudair, the cousin of Sa`d (bin Mu`adh) got up and said to Sa`d bin Ubada, \"You are a liar! By Allah the Eternal, we will surely kill him; and you are a hypocrite defending the hypocrites!\" So the two tribes of Al-Aus and Al-Khazraj got excited till they were on the point of fighting with each other while Allahs Apostle was standing on the pulpit. Allahs Apostle continued quietening them till they became silent whereupon he became silent too. On that day I kept on weeping so much that neither did my tears stop, nor could I sleep. In the morning my parents were with me, and I had wept for two nights and a day without sleeping and with incessant tears till they thought that my liver would burst with weeping. While they were with me and I was weeping, an Ansari woman asked permission to see me. I admitted her and she sat and started weeping with me. While I was in that state, Allahs Apostle came to us, greeted, and sat down,. He had never sat with me since the day what was said, was said. He had stayed a month without receiving any Divine Inspiration concerning my case. Allahs Apostle recited the Tashahhud after he had sat down, and then said, \"Thereafter, O `Aisha! I have been informed such and-such a thing about you; and if you are innocent, Allah will reveal your innocence, and if you have committed a sin, then ask for Allahs forgiveness and repent to Him, for when a slave confesses his sin and then repents to Allah, Allah accepts his repentance.\" When Allahs Apostle had finished his speech, my tears ceased completely so that I no longer felt even a drop thereof. Then I said to my father, \"Reply to Allahs Apostle on my behalf as to what he said.\" He said, \"By Allah, I do not know what to say to Allahs Apostle.\" Then I said to my mother, \"Reply to Allahs Apostle.\" She said, \"I do not know what to say to Allahs Apostle.\" Still a young girl as I was and though I had little knowledge of Quran, I said, \"By Allah, I know that you heard this story (of the Ifk) so much so that it has been planted in your minds and you have believed it. So now, if I tell you that I am innocent, and Allah knows that I am innocent, you will not believe me; and if I confess something, and Allah knows that I am innocent of it, you will believe me. By Allah, I cannot find of you an example except that of Josephs father: \"So (for me) patience is most fitting against that which you assert and it is Allah (Alone) Whose help can be sought. Then I turned away and lay on my bed, and at that time I knew that I was innocent and that Allah would reveal my innocence. But by Allah, I never thought that Allah would sent down about my affair, Divine Inspiration that would be recited (forever), as I considered myself too unworthy to be talked of by Allah with something that was to be recited: but I hoped that Allahs Apostle might have a vision in which Allah would prove my innocence. By Allah, Allahs Apostle had not left his seat and nobody had left the house when the Divine Inspiration came to Allahs Apostle . So there overtook him the same hard condition which used to overtake him (when he was Divinely Inspired) so that the drops of his sweat were running down, like pearls, though it was a (cold) winter day, and that was because of the heaviness of the Statement which was revealed to him. When that state of Allahs Apostle was over, and he was smiling when he was relieved, the first word he said was, \"Aisha, Allah has declared your innocence.\" My mother said to me, \"Get up and go to him.\" I said, \"By Allah, I will not go to him and I will not thank anybody but Allah.\" So Allah revealed: \"Verily! They who spread the Slander are a gang among you. Think it not....\" (24.11-20). When Allah revealed this to confirm my innocence, Abu Bakr As-Siddiq who used to provide for Mistah bin Uthatha because of the latters kinship to him and his poverty, said, \"By Allah, I will never provide for Mistah anything after what he has said about Aisha\". So Allah revealed: (continued...) (continuing... 1): -6.274:... ... \"Let not those among you who are good and are wealthy swear not to give (help) to their kinsmen, those in need, and those who have left their homes for Allahs Cause. Let them Pardon and forgive (i.e. do not punish them). Do you not love that should forgive you? Verily Allah is Oft-forgiving. Most Merciful.\" (24.22) Abu Bakr said, \"Yes, by Allah, I wish that Allah should forgive me.\" So he resumed giving Mistah the aid he used to give him before and said, \"By Allah, I will never withold it from him at all.\" Aisha further said: Allahs Apostle also asked Zainab bint Jahsh about my case. He said, \"O Zainab! What have you seen?\" She replied, \"O Allahs Apostle! I protect my hearing and my sight (by refraining from telling lies). I know nothing but good (about Aisha).\" Of all the wives of Allahs Apostle, it was Zainab who aspired to receive from him the same favor as I used to receive, yet, Allah saved her (from telling lies) because of her piety. But her sister, Hamna, kept on fighting on her behalf so she was destroyed as were those who invented and spread the slander.<D>Narrated Anas bin Malik:That when Haram bin Milhan, his uncle was stabbed on the day of Bir Mauna he sprinkled his blood over his face and his head this way and then said, \"I have succeeded, by the Lord of the Ka`ba.<D>Narrated Aisha:(the wife of the Prophet) \"Whenever Allahs Apostle intended to go on a journey, he would draw lots amongst his wives and would take with him the one upon whom the lot fell. During a Ghazwa of his, he drew lots amongst us and the lot fell upon me, and I proceeded with him after Allah had decreed the use of the veil by women. I was carried in a Howdah (on the camel) and dismounted while still in it. When Allahs Apostle was through with his Ghazwa and returned home, and we approached the city of Medina, Allahs Apostle ordered us to proceed at night. When the order of setting off was given, I walked till I was past the army to answer the call of nature. After finishing I returned (to the camp) to depart (with the others) and suddenly realized that my necklace over my chest was missing. So, I returned to look for it and was delayed because of that. The people who used to carry me on the camel, came to my Howdah and put it on the back of the camel, thinking that I was in it, as, at that time, women were light in weight, and thin and lean, and did not use to eat much. So, those people did not feel the difference in the heaviness of the Howdah while lifting it, and they put it over the camel. At that time I was a young lady. They set the camel moving and proceeded on. I found my necklace after the army had gone, and came to their camp to find nobody. So, I went to the place where I used to stay, thinking that they would discover my absence and come back in my search. While in that state, I felt sleepy and slept. Safwan bin Muattal As-Sulami Adh-Dhakwani was behind the army and reached my abode in the morning. When he saw a sleeping person, he came to me, and he used to see me before veiling. So, I got up when I heard him saying, \"Inna lil-lah-wa inn a ilaihi rajiun (We are for Allah, and we will return to Him).\" He made his camel knell down. He got down from his camel, and put his leg on the front legs of the camel and then I rode and sat over it. Safwan set out walking, leading the camel by the rope till we reached the army who had halted to take rest at midday. Then whoever was meant for destruction, fell into destruction, (some people accused me falsely) and the leader of the false accusers was `Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul. After that we returned to Medina, and I became ill for one month while the people were spreading the forged statements of the false accusers. I was feeling during my ailment as if I were not receiving the usual kindness from the Prophet which I used to receive from him when I got sick. But he would come, greet and say, How is that (girl)? I did not know anything of what was going on till I recovered from my ailment and went out with Um Mistah to the Manasi where we used to answer the call of nature, and we used not to go to answer the call of nature except from night to night and that was before we had lavatories near to our houses. And this habit of ours was similar to the habit of the old Arabs in the open country (or away from houses). So. I and Um Mistah bint Ruhm went out walking. Um Mistah stumbled because of her long dress and on that she said, Let Mistah be ruined. I said, You are saying a bad word. Why are you abusing a man who took part in (the battle of) Badr? She said, O Hanata (you there) didnt you hear what they said? Then she told me the rumors of the false accusers. My sickness was aggravated, and when I returned home, Allahs Apostle came to me, and after greeting he said, How is that (girl)? I requested him to allow me to go to my parents. I wanted then to be sure of the news through them I Allahs Apostle allowed me, and I went to my parents and asked my mother, What are the people talking about? She said, O my daughter! Dont worry much about this matter. By Allah, never is there a charming woman loved by her husband who has other wives, but the women would forge false news about her. I said, Glorified be Allah! Are the people really taking of this matter? That night I kept on weeping and could not sleep till morning. In the morning Allahs Apostle called `Ali bin Abu Talib and Usama bin Zaid when he saw the Divine Inspiration delayed, to consul them about divorcing his wife (i.e. `Aisha). Usama bin Zaid said what he knew of the good reputation of his wives and added, O Allahs Apostle! Keep you wife, for, by Allah, we know nothing about her but good. `Ali bin Abu Talib said, O Allahs Apostle! Allah has no imposed restrictions on you, and there are many women other than she, yet you may ask the woman-servant who will tell you the truth. On that Allahs Apostle called Buraira and said, O Burair. Did you ever see anything which roused your suspicions about her? Buraira said, No, by Allah Who has sent you with the Truth, I have never seen in her anything faulty except that she is a girl of immature age, who sometimes sleeps and leaves the dough for the goats to eat. On that day Allahs Apostle ascended the pulpit and requested that somebody support him in punishing `Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul. Allahs Apostle said, Who will support me to punish that person (`Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul) who has hurt me by slandering the reputation of my family? By Allah, I know nothing about my family but good, and they have accused a person about whom I know nothing except good, and he never entered my house except in my company. Sa`d bin Mu`adh got up and said, O Allahs Apostle! by Allah, I will relieve you from him. If that man is from the tribe of the Aus, then we will chop his head off, and if he is from our brothers, the Khazraj, then order us, and we will fulfill your order. On that Sa`d bin Ubada, the chief of the Khazraj and before this incident, he had been a pious man, got up, motivated by his zeal for his tribe and said, By Allah, you have told a lie; you cannot kill him, and you will never be able to kill him. On that Usaid bin Al-Hadir got up and said (to Sa`d bin Ubada), By Allah! you are a liar. By Allah, we will kill him; and you are a hypocrite, defending the hypocrites. On this the two tribes of Aus and Khazraj got excited and were about to fight each other, while Allahs Apostle was standing on the pulpit. He got down and quieted them till they became silent and he kept quiet. On that day I kept on weeping so much so that neither did my tears stop, nor could I sleep. In the morning my parents were with me and I had wept for two nights and a day, till I thought my liver would burst from weeping. While they were sitting with me and I was weeping, an Ansari woman asked my permission to enter, and I allowed her to come in. She sat down and started weeping with me. While we were in this state, Allahs Apostle came and sat down and he had never sat with me since the day they forged the accusation. No revelation regarding my case came to him for a month. He recited Tashah-hud (i.e. None has the right to be worshipped but Allah and Muhammad is His Apostle) and then said, O `Aisha! I have been informed such-and-such about you; if you are innocent, then Allah will soon reveal your innocence, and if you have committed a sin, then repent to Allah and ask Him to forgive you, for when a person confesses his sin and asks Allah for forgiveness, Allah accepts his repentance. When Allahs Apostle finished his speech my tears ceased completely and there remained not even a single drop of it. I requested my father to reply to Allahs Apostle on my behalf. My father said, By Allah, I do not know what to say to Allahs Apostle. I said to my mother, Talk to Allahs Apostle on my behalf. She said, By Allah, I do not know what to say to Allahs Apostle. I was a young girl and did not have much knowledge of the Quran. I said. I know, by Allah, that you have listened to what people are saying and that has been planted in your minds and you have taken it as a truth. Now, if I told you that I am innocent and Allah knows that I am innocent, you would not believe me and if I confessed to you falsely that I am guilty, and Allah knows that I am innocent you would believe me. By Allah, I dont compare my situation with you except to the situation of Josephs father (i.e. Jacob) who said, So (for me) patience is most fitting against that which you assert and it is Allah (Alone) whose help can be sought. Then I turned to the other side of my bed hoping that Allah would prove my innocence. By Allah I never thought that Allah would reveal Divine Inspiration in my case, as I considered myself too inferior to be talked of in the Holy Quran. I had hoped that Allahs Apostle might have a dream in which Allah would prove my innocence. By Allah, Allahs Apostle had not got up and nobody had left the house before the Divine Inspiration came to Allahs Apostle. So, there overtook him the same state which used to overtake him, (when he used to have, on being inspired divinely). He was sweating so much so that the drops of the sweat were dropping like pearls though it was a (cold) wintry day. When that state of Allahs Apostle was over, he was smiling and the first word he said, `Aisha! Thank Allah, for Allah has declared your innocence. My mother told me to go to Allahs Apostle . I replied, By Allah I will not go to him and will not thank but Allah. So Allah revealed: \"Verily! They who spread the slander are a gang among you . . .\" (24.11) When Allah gave the declaration of my Innocence, Abu Bakr, who used to provide for Mistah bin Uthatha for he was his relative, said, By Allah, I will never provide Mistah with anything because of what he said about Aisha. But Allah later revealed: -- \"And let not those who are good and wealthy among you swear not to help their kinsmen, those in need and those who left their homes in Allahs Cause. Let them forgive and overlook. Do you not wish that Allah should forgive you? Verily! Allah is Oft-forgiving, Most Merciful.\" (24.22) After that Abu Bakr said, Yes ! By Allah! I like that Allah should forgive me, and resumed helping Mistah whom he used to help before. Allahs Apostle also asked Zainab bint Jahsh (i.e. the Prophets wife about me saying, What do you know and what did you see? She replied, O Allahs Apostle! I refrain to claim hearing or seeing what I have not heard or seen. By Allah, I know nothing except goodness about Aisha.\" Aisha further added \"Zainab was competing with me (in her beauty and the Prophets love), yet Allah protected her (from being malicious), for she had piety.\"<D>And from his narration on the authority of Ibn Abbas that he said regarding the interpretation of Allahs saying (Those who disbelieve): (Those who disbelieve) in Muhammad (pbuh) and the Quran (and turn (men) from the way of Allah) and prevent people from the religion and obedience of Allah-the reference here is to those who fed the army of the disbelievers on the Day of Badr: Utbah and Shaybah the sons of Rabiah, Munbih and Nabih the sons of al-Hajjaj, Abul-Buhturi Ibn Hisham and Abu Jahl Ibn Hisham and their host-, (He rendereth their actions vain) He thwarts their good deeds and spending on the Day of Badr.<D>((And it was said unto him): O David!

They started practicing as a teen and have been getting stronger in their faith, which is great. But now they found out that a brother they've known a long time has been talking behind their back. This brother and others are judging them based on how they dress, walk, and talk. It's making them feel depressed and hurt because it seems like they're being hated just for being themselves.\n\nI need to figure out what Islam says about backbiting and how to advise them. I remember that backbiting, or gheebah, is a major sin in Islam. The Prophet (peace be upon him) compared it to eating the flesh of a dead brother. So, that's serious. But how does one deal with being the victim of it?\n\nFirst, I should think about what the person can do internally. Maybe they should try to ignore it and focus on their own relationship with Allah. It's important not to let others' negativity affect their faith. Also, maybe they should make du'a for the people who are talking behind their back, asking Allah to guide them.\n\nThen, there's the question of whether to confront them. If they feel comfortable, maybe talking to the brother privately could help clear things up. But if it might lead to more conflict, it might be better to avoid that.\n\nAlso, surrounding themselves with supportive people is crucial. Being around positive influences can help counteract the negative effects of the backbiting.\n\nI should also consider the Islamic perspective on how to handle such situations. Patience and forgiveness are highly rewarded. Maybe the person should reflect on their own actions to see if there's any unintended offense, but without being too hard on themselves.\n\nOverall, the advice should balance between taking personal steps to protect their faith and emotional well-being, while also considering the teachings of Islam regarding forgiveness and dealing with others' sins.\n</think>\n\nIn addressing the situation of being subjected to backbiting and judgment, it is essential to approach it with both emotional intelligence and Islamic guidance. Here is a structured response:\n\n1. **Internal Reflection and Faith Strengthening:**\n   - **Focus on Personal Relationship with Allah:** Continue to strengthen your faith and connection with Allah. Engage in regular worship, reflection, and dhikr to maintain a strong spiritual foundation.\n   - **Practice Self-Compassion:** Be kind to yourself and avoid self-blame. Recognize that everyone has shortcomings,"}

", "Generated_Answer": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out if chewing gum is halal or haram in Islam. I heard somewhere that some chewing gums contain pig fat, and that's making me concerned because I know pork products aren't allowed in Islam. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what halal and haram mean. Halal refers to things that are permissible under Islamic law, while haram is forbidden. So, if something contains haram ingredients or involves haram processes, it's not allowed.\n\nChewing gum is something a lot of people use, but I don't really know what it's made of. From what I remember, chewing gum usually has gum base, sweeteners, flavorings, and sometimes food coloring. The gum base is what gives it the chewy texture. Now, I've heard that some gum bases might use animal-derived products, like gelatin or tallow, which is animal fat. If that's the case, then if the tallow comes from pigs, that would be a problem because pigs are haram.\n\nSo, I need to find out if most chewing gums use pig fat or not. I think some might, but many could use synthetic alternatives or plant-based ingredients instead. It's probably a mix depending on the brand. That means not all chewing gums are haram, but some could be if they specifically use pig-derived products.\n\nNext, I should consider the Islamic perspective on this. If a product contains any haram ingredient, even in small amounts, it's considered haram. So, if a chewing gum has pig fat, it would be haram to use. However, if it's made with halal ingredients, then it's permissible.\n\nI also remember something about the concept of \"istihala\" in Islamic jurisprudence, which refers to the transformation of substances. If a substance undergoes a significant change, it might be considered different from its original form. But I'm not sure how that applies here. If the pig fat is transformed into something else through processing, maybe it's permissible. But I'm not certain about that, so I should look into it more.\n\nAnother thing to consider is the principle of \"doubt\" in Islamic law. If there's uncertainty about whether a product is halal or haram, it's better to avoid it to stay on the safe side. So, if I'm not sure if a particular chewing gum contains haram ingredients, I might want to choose a different brand that"}
{"Question": "I read somewhere that the Beloved Prophet (peace be upon him) used to put oil in his hair, so much so that his clothes/turban would become oily. Was this olive oil that he used? If one rubs olive oil into the hair and scalp for its healthy benefit, is doing wudu over oil-covered hair, and subsequent salat valid? ? --T--", "Answer": "Assalamu alaykum Oil normally soaks very quickly into the hair and becomes absorbed through the scalp. It does not necessarily coat the hair. In dry climates, many people apply oil their hair to protect it from dryness and to gain some coolness. The oil penetrates the hair and scalp and disappears quickly. Therefore, it is permissible to make masah (pass a wetted hand) over oiled hair, unless an excessive amount has been used, in which case one can wait for a short while before making wudu or perform wudu before applying the oil. The Messenger of Allah (upon him be peace) has recommended the use of olive oil, both in cooking and in applying to the body and hair (Shamail Tirmidhi). Shaykh Zakariyya Kandhlawi, in his commentary on this hadith, states that the Messengers (upon him be peace) recommending it means that he possibly used it himself. ", "Document": "Urwa b. Zubair reported on the authority of Aisha, the wife of Allahs Apostle (may peace be upon him), that she said:Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) died (in a state) that it never happened that he could eat to his fill the bread with olive oil twice during a day.<D>It wasnarrated from Ibn ‘Umar that the Prophet () used to put oilonhis head when he was in the state of Ihram, but not oil that wasperfumed.<D>Qatadah narrated from Abu Abdullah that Zaid bin Arqam said:\"The Prophet (S.A.W) would acclaim oil and Wars for (the treatment of) pleurisy.\" Qatadah said: \"And it is put in the mouth on the side which he is suffering. \"<D>Allah then mentioned the honour and blessings that He had bestowed upon the believers, saying: (Allah is the Light of the heavens and the earth) He is the guide of the dwellers of the heaves and earth. Guidance from Allah is of two types: clarification and making things known; it is also said that the verse means: Allah is the embellisher of the heavens by means of the stars and the embellisher of the earth by means of plants and water; it is also said that this means: Allah enlightens the hearts of the believers among the dwellers of the heavens and the earth. (The similitude of His light) the light of the believers; it is also said that this means: the light of Allah in the heart of the believer (is as a niche wherein is a lamp. The lamp is in a glass) made of gems. (The glass is as it were a shining star) one of the following five planets: Mercury, Jupiter, Venus, Mars and Saturn. All these planets are luminous. ((This lamp is) kindled from a blessed tree) from the oil of a blessed tree, (an olive neither of the East nor of the West) in an open space, not touched by the shade of the East nor by the shade of the West; it is also said that this means: in a location which isuntouched by the sun when it rises and when it sets, (whose oil) the oil of the tree (would almost glow forth(of itself)) from behind its rind (though no fire touched it. Light upon light) the lamp emits light and the glass emits light and the oil emits light, (Allah guideth unto His light) Allah honours with knowledge; it isalso said that this means: Allah honours with His religion (whom He will) whoever deserves it; it is also said that the verse means: the likeness of the light of Muhammad in the loins of his forefathers is like this, up to Allahs saying ( kindled from a blessed tree). He says: the light of Muhammad in Abraham was an upright religion (olive tree), and Abraham was neither Jew nor Christian (neither of the East nor of the West), the works of Abraham would almost glow forth in the loins of his forefathers like this (would almost glow forth (of itself)), up until Allahs saying (kindled from a blessed tree) He says: as if it is the light of Muhammad (pbuh) and if Abraham was not a prophet, he would still have this light (though no fire touched it); it is also said that the latter passage means: Had Allah not honoured Abraham, he would not have had this light; it is also said: if Allah had not honoured His believing servant with this light, he would not have had it. (AndAllah speaketh to mankind in allegories) in this way does Allah show to people the trait of knowledge, (for Allah is knower of all things) regarding the honour He bestows upon His servants. Allah struck this similitude of knowledge and clarified its benefit and its praiseworthiness in order that they give thanks to it. Allah says here that just as one uses a lamp to find his way in the dark, so is the light of knowledge used for ones guidance; and just as one uses the stars and planets to find ones way in the darkness of the seas and land, one also uses the light of knowledge for guidance in the darkness of disbelief and idolatry; and just as theoil of a lamp is taken from the blessed olive tree, so too is knowledge from Allah, Exalted is He, for His servant; and just as the olive tree is neither from the East nor from the West, so too is the believer an upright Muslim, neither Jew nor Christian; and just as the oil of the olive tree would almost glow forth of itself even when no fire touches it, so too the faith of the believer is praiseworthy even when there are no virtuous works to accompany it; and just as the niche and the glass and the lamp are light upon light, so too is knowledge light, and the heart of the believer is light and his chest is light and his incoming is light andhis outgoing is light: light upon light; and Allah honours with this light whomever He wills.

I remember reading that he used oil in his hair, so much that his clothes and turban would get oily. The question is whether that oil was olive oil. Also, if someone uses olive oil on their hair and scalp for health benefits, does that affect their wudu and salat? I'm a bit confused about how oil in the hair interacts with the validity of ablution and prayer.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out if the Prophet specifically used olive oil. I know he lived in a region where olive oil was available, but I'm not sure if that's what he used. Maybe he used other oils like coconut or sesame? I should check some reliable sources or hadiths to confirm this.\n\nNext, regarding the wudu and salat part. I remember that for wudu, one must wash the face, arms, head, and feet. If the hair is covered in oil, does that create a barrier that water can't penetrate? I think the key point is whether the oil prevents water from reaching the scalp. If it does, then wudu might not be valid because the water didn't touch the skin. But if the oil is applied in a way that water can still reach the scalp, then it's okay.\n\nI also recall that the Prophet had thick, curly hair, so using oil made it manageable. Maybe he applied it in a way that didn't block water. So, for someone using olive oil, they should apply a small amount so it doesn't form a thick layer. Then, during wudu, they can massage the scalp to ensure water reaches it.\n\nI should also consider if the oil is pure and not mixed with any impurities. Olive oil is generally pure, so that shouldn't be a problem. But if the oil was mixed with something najis, that would affect the wudu.\n\nAnother thought: some scholars might have different opinions on this. Maybe some are stricter about any barrier, while others are more lenient as long as water can reach the skin. I should look into different scholarly views to see the consensus.\n\nIn summary, the Prophet likely used olive oil, and using olive oil in moderation for hair health is fine. For wudu, as long as the oil isn't so thick that water can't reach the scalp, the ablution and subsequent prayer should be valid. It's also important to apply the oil properly and ensure purity.\n</think>"}

It's important to advise against taking matters into their own hands, as it could have serious consequences.\n\nInstead, I should suggest alternative solutions. They could try contacting local animal control or wildlife services again, maybe escalating the issue if it's not being addressed. Community efforts, like talking to the neighbors about stopping the feeding, might help. There are also humane deterrents, such as using noise-making devices or motion-activated sprinklers to scare the dogs away without harming them.\n\nAdditionally, reaching out to local Islamic scholars or community leaders could provide guidance that aligns with their faith. They might offer specific advice or help mediate the situation with the neighbors.\n\nIt's also important to ensure the safety of their family. Keeping children indoors when the dogs are around and securing any food sources that might be attracting the strays could help reduce the problem. If the dogs are aggressive, consulting with a professional, like a dog catcher or animal behaviorist, might be necessary.\n\nIn summary, while the situation is stressful and dangerous, there are multiple avenues to explore before considering harmful actions.

Please see the following links related to your question about wearing hijab: Why Hijab?By Shaykh Nuh Ha Mim KellerThe Islamic Veil or Hijabjannah", "Document": "Narrated Aisha:(The wife of the Prophet) Whenever Allahs Apostle intended to go on a journey, he used to draw lots among his wives and would take with him the one on whom the lot had fallen. Once he drew lots when he wanted to carry out a Ghazwa, and the lot came upon me. So I proceeded with Allahs Apostle after Allahs order of veiling (the women) had been revealed and thus I was carried in my howdah (on a camel) and dismounted while still in it. We carried on our journey, and when Allahs Apostle had finished his Ghazwa and returned and we approached Medina, Allahs Apostle ordered to proceed at night. When the army was ordered to resume the homeward journey, I got up and walked on till I left the army (camp) behind. When I had answered the call of nature, I went towards my howdah, but behold ! A necklace of mine made of Jaz Azfar (a kind of black bead) was broken and I looked for it and my search for it detained me. The group of people who used to carry me, came and carried my howdah on to the back of my camel on which I was riding, considering that I was therein. At that time women were light in weight and were not fleshy for they used to eat little (food), so those people did not feel the lightness of the howdah while raising it up, and I was still a young lady. They drove away the camel and proceeded. Then I found my necklace after the army had gone. I came to their camp but found nobody therein so I went to the place where I used to stay, thinking that they would miss me and come back in my search. While I was sitting at my place, I felt sleepy and slept. Safwan bin Al-Muattil As-Sulami Adh- Dhakw-ani was behind the army. He had started in the last part of the night and reached my stationing place in the morning and saw the figure of a sleeping person. He came to me and recognized me on seeing me for he used to see me before veiling. I got up because of his saying: \"Inna Li l-lahi wa inna ilaihi rajiun,\" which he uttered on recognizing me. I covered my face with my garment, and by Allah, he did not say to me a single word except, \"Inna Li l-lahi wa inna ilaihi rajiun,\" till he made his shecamel kneel down whereupon he trod on its forelegs and I mounted it. Then Safwan set out, leading the she-camel that was carrying me, till we met the army while they were resting during the hot midday. Then whoever was meant for destruction, fell in destruction, and the leader of the Ifk (forged statement) was `Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul. After this we arrived at Medina and I became ill for one month while the people were spreading the forged statements of the people of the Ifk, and I was not aware of anything thereof. But what aroused my doubt while I was sick, was that I was no longer receiving from Allahs Apostle the same kindness as I used to receive when I fell sick. Allahs Apostle would enter upon me, say a greeting and add, \"How is that (lady)?\" and then depart. That aroused my suspicion but I was not aware of the propagated evil till I recovered from my ailment. I went out with Um Mistah to answer the call of nature towards Al-Manasi, the place where we used to relieve ourselves, and used not to go out for this purpose except from night to night, and that was before we had lavatories close to our houses. And this habit of ours was similar to the habit of the old Arabs (in the deserts or in the tents) concerning the evacuation of the bowels, for we considered it troublesome and harmful to take lavatories in the houses. So I went out with Um Mistah who was the daughter of Abi Ruhm bin `Abd Manaf, and her mother was daughter of Sakhr bin Amir who was the aunt of Abi Bakr As-Siddiq, and her son was Mistah bin Uthatha. When we had finished our affair, Um Mistah and I came back towards my house. Um Mistah stumbled over her robe whereupon she said, \"Let Mistah be ruined ! \" I said to her, \"What a bad word you have said! Do you abuse a man who has taken part in the Battle of Badr? She said, \"O you there! Didnt you hear what he has said?\" I said, \"And what did he say?\" She then told me the statement of the people of the Ifk (forged statement) which added to my ailment. When I returned home, Allahs Apostle came to me, and after greeting, he said, \"How is that (lady)?\" I said, \"Will you allow me to go to my parents?\" At that time I intended to be sure of the news through them. Allahs Apostle allowed me and I went to my parents and asked my mother, \"O my mother! What are the people talking about?\" My mother said, \"O my daughter! Take it easy, for by Allah, there is no charming lady who is loved by her husband who has other wives as well, but that those wives would find fault with her.\" I said, \"Subhan Allah! Did the people really talk about that?\" That night I kept on weeping the whole night till the morning. My tears never stopped, nor did I sleep, and morning broke while I was still weeping, Allahs Apostle called `Ali bin Abi Talib and Usama bin Zaid when the Divine Inspiration delayed, in order to consult them as to the idea of divorcing his wife. Usama bin Zaid told Allahs Apostle of what he knew about the innocence of his wife and of his affection he kept for her. He said, \"O Allahs Apostle! She is your wife, and we do not know anything about her except good.\" But `Ali bin Abi Talib said, \"O Allahs Apostle! Allah does not impose restrictions on you; and there are plenty of women other than her. If you however, ask (her) slave girl, she will tell you the truth.\" `Aisha added: So Allahs Apostle called for Barira and said, \"O Barira! Did you ever see anything which might have aroused your suspicion? (as regards Aisha). Barira said, \"By Allah Who has sent you with the truth, I have never seen anything regarding Aisha which I would blame her for except that she is a girl of immature age who sometimes sleeps and leaves the dough of her family unprotected so that the domestic goats come and eat it.\" So Allahs Apostle got up (and addressed) the people an asked for somebody who would take revenge on `Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul then. Allahs Apostle, while on the pulpit, said, \"O Muslims! Who will help me against a man who has hurt me by slandering my family? By Allah, I know nothing except good about my family, and people have blamed a man of whom I know nothing except good, and he never used to visit my family except with me,\" Sa`d bin Mu`adh Al-Ansari got up and said, \"O Allahs Apostle! By Allah, I will relieve you from him. If he be from the tribe of (Bani) Al-Aus, then I will chop his head off; and if he be from our brethren, the Khazraj, then you give us your order and we will obey it.\" On that, Sa`d bin Ubada got up, and he was the chief of the Khazraj, and before this incident he had been a pious man but he was incited by his zeal for his tribe. He said to Sa`d (bin Mu`adh), \"By Allah the Eternal, you have told a lie! You shall not kill him and you will never be able to kill him!\" On that, Usaid bin Hudair, the cousin of Sa`d (bin Mu`adh) got up and said to Sa`d bin Ubada, \"You are a liar! By Allah the Eternal, we will surely kill him; and you are a hypocrite defending the hypocrites!\" So the two tribes of Al-Aus and Al-Khazraj got excited till they were on the point of fighting with each other while Allahs Apostle was standing on the pulpit. Allahs Apostle continued quietening them till they became silent whereupon he became silent too. On that day I kept on weeping so much that neither did my tears stop, nor could I sleep. In the morning my parents were with me, and I had wept for two nights and a day without sleeping and with incessant tears till they thought that my liver would burst with weeping. While they were with me and I was weeping, an Ansari woman asked permission to see me. I admitted her and she sat and started weeping with me. While I was in that state, Allahs Apostle came to us, greeted, and sat down,. He had never sat with me since the day what was said, was said. He had stayed a month without receiving any Divine Inspiration concerning my case. Allahs Apostle recited the Tashahhud after he had sat down, and then said, \"Thereafter, O `Aisha! I have been informed such and-such a thing about you; and if you are innocent, Allah will reveal your innocence, and if you have committed a sin, then ask for Allahs forgiveness and repent to Him, for when a slave confesses his sin and then repents to Allah, Allah accepts his repentance.\" When Allahs Apostle had finished his speech, my tears ceased completely so that I no longer felt even a drop thereof. Then I said to my father, \"Reply to Allahs Apostle on my behalf as to what he said.\" He said, \"By Allah, I do not know what to say to Allahs Apostle.\" Then I said to my mother, \"Reply to Allahs Apostle.\" She said, \"I do not know what to say to Allahs Apostle.\" Still a young girl as I was and though I had little knowledge of Quran, I said, \"By Allah, I know that you heard this story (of the Ifk) so much so that it has been planted in your minds and you have believed it. So now, if I tell you that I am innocent, and Allah knows that I am innocent, you will not believe me; and if I confess something, and Allah knows that I am innocent of it, you will believe me. By Allah, I cannot find of you an example except that of Josephs father: \"So (for me) patience is most fitting against that which you assert and it is Allah (Alone) Whose help can be sought. Then I turned away and lay on my bed, and at that time I knew that I was innocent and that Allah would reveal my innocence. But by Allah, I never thought that Allah would sent down about my affair, Divine Inspiration that would be recited (forever), as I considered myself too unworthy to be talked of by Allah with something that was to be recited: but I hoped that Allahs Apostle might have a vision in which Allah would prove my innocence. By Allah, Allahs Apostle had not left his seat and nobody had left the house when the Divine Inspiration came to Allahs Apostle . So there overtook him the same hard condition which used to overtake him (when he was Divinely Inspired) so that the drops of his sweat were running down, like pearls, though it was a (cold) winter day, and that was because of the heaviness of the Statement which was revealed to him. When that state of Allahs Apostle was over, and he was smiling when he was relieved, the first word he said was, \"Aisha, Allah has declared your innocence.\" My mother said to me, \"Get up and go to him.\" I said, \"By Allah, I will not go to him and I will not thank anybody but Allah.\" So Allah revealed: \"Verily! They who spread the Slander are a gang among you. Think it not....\" (24.11-20). When Allah revealed this to confirm my innocence, Abu Bakr As-Siddiq who used to provide for Mistah bin Uthatha because of the latters kinship to him and his poverty, said, \"By Allah, I will never provide for Mistah anything after what he has said about Aisha\". So Allah revealed: (continued...) (continuing... 1): -6.274:... ... \"Let not those among you who are good and are wealthy swear not to give (help) to their kinsmen, those in need, and those who have left their homes for Allahs Cause. Let them Pardon and forgive (i.e. do not punish them). Do you not love that should forgive you? Verily Allah is Oft-forgiving. Most Merciful.\" (24.22) Abu Bakr said, \"Yes, by Allah, I wish that Allah should forgive me.\" So he resumed giving Mistah the aid he used to give him before and said, \"By Allah, I will never withold it from him at all.\" Aisha further said: Allahs Apostle also asked Zainab bint Jahsh about my case. He said, \"O Zainab! What have you seen?\" She replied, \"O Allahs Apostle! I protect my hearing and my sight (by refraining from telling lies). I know nothing but good (about Aisha).\" Of all the wives of Allahs Apostle, it was Zainab who aspired to receive from him the same favor as I used to receive, yet, Allah saved her (from telling lies) because of her piety. But her sister, Hamna, kept on fighting on her behalf so she was destroyed as were those who invented and spread the slander.<D>Narrated Aisha:(the wife of the Prophet) \"Whenever Allahs Apostle intended to go on a journey, he would draw lots amongst his wives and would take with him the one upon whom the lot fell. During a Ghazwa of his, he drew lots amongst us and the lot fell upon me, and I proceeded with him after Allah had decreed the use of the veil by women. I was carried in a Howdah (on the camel) and dismounted while still in it. When Allahs Apostle was through with his Ghazwa and returned home, and we approached the city of Medina, Allahs Apostle ordered us to proceed at night. When the order of setting off was given, I walked till I was past the army to answer the call of nature. After finishing I returned (to the camp) to depart (with the others) and suddenly realized that my necklace over my chest was missing. So, I returned to look for it and was delayed because of that. The people who used to carry me on the camel, came to my Howdah and put it on the back of the camel, thinking that I was in it, as, at that time, women were light in weight, and thin and lean, and did not use to eat much. So, those people did not feel the difference in the heaviness of the Howdah while lifting it, and they put it over the camel. At that time I was a young lady. They set the camel moving and proceeded on. I found my necklace after the army had gone, and came to their camp to find nobody. So, I went to the place where I used to stay, thinking that they would discover my absence and come back in my search. While in that state, I felt sleepy and slept. Safwan bin Muattal As-Sulami Adh-Dhakwani was behind the army and reached my abode in the morning. When he saw a sleeping person, he came to me, and he used to see me before veiling. So, I got up when I heard him saying, \"Inna lil-lah-wa inn a ilaihi rajiun (We are for Allah, and we will return to Him).\" He made his camel knell down. He got down from his camel, and put his leg on the front legs of the camel and then I rode and sat over it. Safwan set out walking, leading the camel by the rope till we reached the army who had halted to take rest at midday. Then whoever was meant for destruction, fell into destruction, (some people accused me falsely) and the leader of the false accusers was `Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul. After that we returned to Medina, and I became ill for one month while the people were spreading the forged statements of the false accusers. I was feeling during my ailment as if I were not receiving the usual kindness from the Prophet which I used to receive from him when I got sick. But he would come, greet and say, How is that (girl)? I did not know anything of what was going on till I recovered from my ailment and went out with Um Mistah to the Manasi where we used to answer the call of nature, and we used not to go to answer the call of nature except from night to night and that was before we had lavatories near to our houses. And this habit of ours was similar to the habit of the old Arabs in the open country (or away from houses). So. I and Um Mistah bint Ruhm went out walking. Um Mistah stumbled because of her long dress and on that she said, Let Mistah be ruined. I said, You are saying a bad word. Why are you abusing a man who took part in (the battle of) Badr? She said, O Hanata (you there) didnt you hear what they said? Then she told me the rumors of the false accusers. My sickness was aggravated, and when I returned home, Allahs Apostle came to me, and after greeting he said, How is that (girl)? I requested him to allow me to go to my parents. I wanted then to be sure of the news through them I Allahs Apostle allowed me, and I went to my parents and asked my mother, What are the people talking about? She said, O my daughter! Dont worry much about this matter. By Allah, never is there a charming woman loved by her husband who has other wives, but the women would forge false news about her. I said, Glorified be Allah! Are the people really taking of this matter? That night I kept on weeping and could not sleep till morning. In the morning Allahs Apostle called `Ali bin Abu Talib and Usama bin Zaid when he saw the Divine Inspiration delayed, to consul them about divorcing his wife (i.e. `Aisha). Usama bin Zaid said what he knew of the good reputation of his wives and added, O Allahs Apostle! Keep you wife, for, by Allah, we know nothing about her but good. `Ali bin Abu Talib said, O Allahs Apostle! Allah has no imposed restrictions on you, and there are many women other than she, yet you may ask the woman-servant who will tell you the truth. On that Allahs Apostle called Buraira and said, O Burair. Did you ever see anything which roused your suspicions about her? Buraira said, No, by Allah Who has sent you with the Truth, I have never seen in her anything faulty except that she is a girl of immature age, who sometimes sleeps and leaves the dough for the goats to eat. On that day Allahs Apostle ascended the pulpit and requested that somebody support him in punishing `Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul. Allahs Apostle said, Who will support me to punish that person (`Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul) who has hurt me by slandering the reputation of my family? By Allah, I know nothing about my family but good, and they have accused a person about whom I know nothing except good, and he never entered my house except in my company. Sa`d bin Mu`adh got up and said, O Allahs Apostle! by Allah, I will relieve you from him. If that man is from the tribe of the Aus, then we will chop his head off, and if he is from our brothers, the Khazraj, then order us, and we will fulfill your order. On that Sa`d bin Ubada, the chief of the Khazraj and before this incident, he had been a pious man, got up, motivated by his zeal for his tribe and said, By Allah, you have told a lie; you cannot kill him, and you will never be able to kill him. On that Usaid bin Al-Hadir got up and said (to Sa`d bin Ubada), By Allah! you are a liar. By Allah, we will kill him; and you are a hypocrite, defending the hypocrites. On this the two tribes of Aus and Khazraj got excited and were about to fight each other, while Allahs Apostle was standing on the pulpit. He got down and quieted them till they became silent and he kept quiet. On that day I kept on weeping so much so that neither did my tears stop, nor could I sleep. In the morning my parents were with me and I had wept for two nights and a day, till I thought my liver would burst from weeping. While they were sitting with me and I was weeping, an Ansari woman asked my permission to enter, and I allowed her to come in. She sat down and started weeping with me. While we were in this state, Allahs Apostle came and sat down and he had never sat with me since the day they forged the accusation. No revelation regarding my case came to him for a month. He recited Tashah-hud (i.e. None has the right to be worshipped but Allah and Muhammad is His Apostle) and then said, O `Aisha! I have been informed such-and-such about you; if you are innocent, then Allah will soon reveal your innocence, and if you have committed a sin, then repent to Allah and ask Him to forgive you, for when a person confesses his sin and asks Allah for forgiveness, Allah accepts his repentance. When Allahs Apostle finished his speech my tears ceased completely and there remained not even a single drop of it. I requested my father to reply to Allahs Apostle on my behalf. My father said, By Allah, I do not know what to say to Allahs Apostle. I said to my mother, Talk to Allahs Apostle on my behalf. She said, By Allah, I do not know what to say to Allahs Apostle. I was a young girl and did not have much knowledge of the Quran. I said. I know, by Allah, that you have listened to what people are saying and that has been planted in your minds and you have taken it as a truth. Now, if I told you that I am innocent and Allah knows that I am innocent, you would not believe me and if I confessed to you falsely that I am guilty, and Allah knows that I am innocent you would believe me. By Allah, I dont compare my situation with you except to the situation of Josephs father (i.e. Jacob) who said, So (for me) patience is most fitting against that which you assert and it is Allah (Alone) whose help can be sought. Then I turned to the other side of my bed hoping that Allah would prove my innocence. By Allah I never thought that Allah would reveal Divine Inspiration in my case, as I considered myself too inferior to be talked of in the Holy Quran. I had hoped that Allahs Apostle might have a dream in which Allah would prove my innocence. By Allah, Allahs Apostle had not got up and nobody had left the house before the Divine Inspiration came to Allahs Apostle. So, there overtook him the same state which used to overtake him, (when he used to have, on being inspired divinely). He was sweating so much so that the drops of the sweat were dropping like pearls though it was a (cold) wintry day. When that state of Allahs Apostle was over, he was smiling and the first word he said, `Aisha! Thank Allah, for Allah has declared your innocence. My mother told me to go to Allahs Apostle . I replied, By Allah I will not go to him and will not thank but Allah. So Allah revealed: \"Verily! They who spread the slander are a gang among you . . .\" (24.11) When Allah gave the declaration of my Innocence, Abu Bakr, who used to provide for Mistah bin Uthatha for he was his relative, said, By Allah, I will never provide Mistah with anything because of what he said about Aisha. But Allah later revealed: -- \"And let not those who are good and wealthy among you swear not to help their kinsmen, those in need and those who left their homes in Allahs Cause. Let them forgive and overlook. Do you not wish that Allah should forgive you? Verily! Allah is Oft-forgiving, Most Merciful.\" (24.22) After that Abu Bakr said, Yes ! By Allah! I like that Allah should forgive me, and resumed helping Mistah whom he used to help before. Allahs Apostle also asked Zainab bint Jahsh (i.e. the Prophets wife about me saying, What do you know and what did you see? She replied, O Allahs Apostle! I refrain to claim hearing or seeing what I have not heard or seen. By Allah, I know nothing except goodness about Aisha.\" Aisha further added \"Zainab was competing with me (in her beauty and the Prophets love), yet Allah protected her (from being malicious), for she had piety.\"<D>Narrated Aishah:\"What was said about me had been said, and I myself was unaware of it, the Messenger of Allah () got up and addressed the people. He recited the Tashahhud and after praising and expressing gratitude to Allah, as He deserved, he said: To proceed: O people! Give me your opinion regarding those people who made a forged story against my wife. By Allah, I do not know anything bad about her at all. By Allah, they accused her of being with a man about whom I have never known anything bad, and he never entered my house unless I was present there, and whenever I went on a journey, he went with me. Sad bin Muadh [may Allah be pleased with him] got up and said: O Messenger of Allah ()! Allow me to chop their heads off! Then a man from Al-Khazraj, to whom the mother of Hassan bin Thabit was a relative, got up and said (to Sad): You have told a lie! By Allah, if those persons were from Al-Aws, you would not like to chop their heads. It was probable that some evil would take place between Aws and Khazraj in the Masjid while I was unaware of that. In the evening of that day, I went out for some of my needs, and Umm Mistah was accompanying me. On our return, Umm Mistah stumbled and said: Let Mistah be ruined! I said to her, O mother! Why do you abuse your son? On that Umm Mistah became silent for a while, and stumbling again, she said: Let Mistah be ruined! I said to her: O mother! Why do you abuse your son? She stumbled for the third time and said: Let Mistah be ruined! I said to her: O mother! Why do you abuse your son? Upon that she said: By Allah! I do not abuse him except because of you. I asked her: Concerning what of my affairs? So she disclosed the whole story to me. I said: Has this really happened? She replied: Yes, by Allah! I returned to my house, so astonished, that I did not know for what purpose I had gone out. Then I became sick and said to the Messenger of Allah () Send me to my fathers house. So he sent a servant with me, and when I entered the house, I found Umm Ruman downstairs, while Abu Bakr was reciting something upstairs. My mother asked: What has brought you, O daughter? She said: \"I informed her and mentioned the whole story to her, but she did not feel as I did about it. She said: O my daughter! Do not worry much about this matter, for there is never a charming lady loved by her husband who has other wives, but that they feel jealous of her and speak badly of her. But she did not feel the same about it as I did. I asked her: Does my father know about it? She said Yes. I asked: Does the Messenger of Allah () know about it too? She said Yes, the Messenger of Allah () also knows about it. Tears filled my eyes and I wept. Abu Bakr, who was reading upstairs, heard my voice, and came down asking my mother: What is the matter with her? She said: She has heard what has been said about her. On that Abu Bakr wept and said: I beseech you, by Allah, O my daughter, to go back to your home. I went back to my home, and the Messenger of Allah () had come to my house asking my maid-servant about me. The maid-servant said: By Allah! I do not know of any fault or defect in her character except that she sleeps and lets the sheep enter and eat her dough. On that, some of the Prophets Companions spoke harshly to her and said: Tell the truth to the Messenger of Allah (). Finally, they told her of the slander and she said: Subhan Allah! By Allah, I know nothing against her except what a goldsmith knows about a piece of pure gold. Then this news reached the man who was accused, and he said: Subhan Allah! By Allah, I have never uncovered the private parts of any woman. Later, that man was martyred in Allahs Cause. Then the next morning, my parents came to pay me a visit and they stayed with me until the Messenger of Allah () came to me, after he performed the Asr prayer. He came to me and while my parents were sitting around me on my right and my left. The Prophet () said the Tashahhud, praised and glorified Allah and said: Now then, O Aishah! If you have committed a bad deed, or you have wronged (yourself), then repent to Allah, as Allah accepts the repentance from His worshipers. An Ansari woman had come and was sitting near the gate. I said to the Prophet (): Isnt it improper that you speak in such a way in the presence of this lady? The Messenger of Allah () then gave a piece of advice and I turned to my father and requested him to reply to him. My father said: What should I say? Then I turned to my mother and asked her to answer him. She said: What should I say? When my parents did not reply to the Prophet (), I said the Tashahhud, praised and glorified Allah as His due, and I said: Then, by Allah! If I were to tell you that I have not done (this) and Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, is witness that I am telling the truth, that would not be of any use to me on your part, because you (people) have spoken about it and your hearts have absorbed it (as truth); and if I were to tell you that I have done this sin, and Allah knows that I have not done it, then you will say: She has confessed her guilt. By Allah! I do not see a suitable example for me and you except the example of - and I could not remember Yaqbus name - Yusufs father when he said: So patience is most fitting. And it is Allah Whose help can be sought against that which you describe (12:18). She said: \"It was at that time that Revelation came to the Messenger of Allah (), and we remained silent. Then the Revelation was over, and I noticed the signs of happiness on his face while he was wiping (the sweat) from his forehead, and saying: Have the good tidings O Aishah! Allah has revealed your innocence. At that time I was extremely angry. My parents said to me: Get up and go to him. I said: By Allah, I will not do it,and will not thank him nor either of you, but I will thank Allah, Who has revealed my innocence. You have heard (this story) but neither of you have denied it, nor have you changed it (to defend me).\" Aishah used to say: \"But as regards to Zainab bint Jahsh, Allah protected her because of her piety. She did not say anything except good (about me). But her sister, Hamnah was ruined among those who were ruined. Those who used to speak evil about me were Mistah, Hassan bin Thabit, and the hypocrite Abdullah bin Ubayy [bin Salul] and [it is he who] used to spread that news and tempt others to speak of it, and it was he and Hamnah who had the greater share therein. Abu Bakr took an oath that he would never do any favor for Mistah at all. Then Allah, Most High, revealed this Ayah: Let not those among you who are blessed with graces and wealth [until the end of the Ayah] referring to Abu Bakr: to give their kinsmen, the poor, and those who left their homes for Allahs Cause. - meaning Mistah - up to His saying: Do you not love that Allah should forgive you?

Is it worth the effort, or is there a way to resolve this without retrieving the game?\n\nI also wonder if the game is still in his possession. Three years is a long time; maybe he lost it or doesn't have it anymore. If that's the case, then trying to get it back might be pointless. \n\nAnother angle is to consider the impact. If I do get it back, destroying it would prevent it from causing harm. But if I can't get it back, maybe there's a way to make amends or find an alternative solution. Perhaps I can perform some good deeds to compensate or seek forgiveness.\n\nI also need to think about the principle of returning what's owed. As a Muslim, am I required to make sure that anything haram I've given out is taken back, even if it's difficult? Or is there some leeway if the circumstances make it hard?\n\nI should probably look into what scholars say about this. Maybe there are rulings about how to handle such situations. I think making an effort to retrieve it is important, but if it's not possible, then maybe other forms of expiation are recommended.\n\nSo, in summary, I should try to contact him and ask for the game back. If that's not possible, maybe I can find another way to address the issue, like charity or prayer. I need to balance the obligation to prevent harm with"}

They mentioned that when they pass stool, not all of it comes out, and every time they wipe, there's still a stain on the tissue even after washing. They tried not washing and walking around, but the issue persists. I need to figure out what they can do about this.\n\nFirst, I should consider possible causes. Constipation itself can lead to incomplete evacuation, so maybe that's contributing. If the stool is hard or dry, it might not come out all at once. Also, if the rectal muscles aren't fully evacuating, some stool might remain, causing the staining.\n\nI remember that fiber is important for bowel health. Maybe they aren't getting enough fiber in their diet. Foods like fruits, vegetables, and whole grains can help soften stool and make it easier to pass completely. Drinking enough water is also crucial because dehydration can make stools harder.\n\nExercise might be another factor. Regular physical activity can help stimulate bowel movements. If they're not moving much, that could be part of the problem. I should suggest they try to be more active, even if it's just walking a bit each day.\n\nThe way they wipe might also be an issue. Using toilet paper can sometimes leave residue, especially if they're not wiping thoroughly. Maybe using a bidet or a wet wipe could help clean more effectively. They might also try wiping in different directions or using a different technique to ensure they're getting everything.\n\nStool consistency is another thing to think about. If their stool is too soft or too hard, it can cause incomplete evacuation. They might benefit from tracking their bowel movements to see if there's a pattern. A food diary could help identify any dietary triggers that are affecting their stool consistency.\n\nOver-the-counter remedies like fiber supplements or stool softeners might be necessary if dietary changes aren't enough. However, they should be cautious not to overuse laxatives because that can lead to dependence.\n\nI should also mention the possibility of consulting a healthcare provider if the problem doesn't improve. There could be an underlying issue like hemorrhoids or a rectal prolapse that needs medical attention.\n\nStress and anxiety can affect digestion too, so maybe suggesting relaxation techniques could help. Stress can slow down the digestive system, leading to constipation.\n\nLastly, good hygiene is important. Even if they're using water to clean, ensuring the area is thoroughly washed can prevent leftover stool from causing irritation or odor.\n\nPutting it all together, the advice should"}

They want to stop watching porn and are also concerned about whether to tell their fiancée about their habit without making her aware.

I remember that breaking an addiction often involves a combination of willpower, seeking help, and changing environments or habits. Maybe suggesting practical steps like avoiding triggers, using website blockers, or talking to a counselor could be useful. It might also help to focus on the negative effects of porn, like how it can distort real relationships or lower self-esteem.\n\nThen, the user is engaged and is unsure whether to tell their fiancée.

Alternatively, if they're not ready, perhaps working on overcoming the addiction first and then being honest once they've made progress.\n\nSpiritually, invoking Allah's mercy and forgiveness is crucial. Encouraging the person to perform Istighfar, seek strength through prayer, and engage in positive activities that bring them closer to their faith might help. Maybe suggesting specific duas or Islamic teachings that discuss overcoming desires and seeking righteousness.\n\nI should also consider the psychological aspect. Addiction is a struggle, and it's important to be compassionate.

{"Question": "I have been asked by someone who is considering to convert to Islam whether or not it is permissible for men to to wear earrings according to the classical fiqh? I told him that I was unaware of a complete consensus on this issue, although it was agreed that for men to imitate women and to wear gold was forbidden. (he was wearing wooden cuffs on the ears). I expressed uncertainty on this as I recalled ( I think, long time ago) seeing Arabian and African Muslim tribesmen wearing earrings, although I do not think they were wearing golden ones. ? --T--", "Answer": " It is impermissible for men to wear earrings or have their ears pierced in order to wear earrings. There are certain reasons for this prohibition: Firstly, it is agreed upon by the scholars, that it is unlawful for men to adorn themselves with any type of jewellery besides a silver ring. (See: Ibn Qudama, al-Mughni, 2.324 & al-Mawsua al-Fiqhiyya). The great Hanafi Jurist, Imam al-Haskafi (may Allah have mercy on him) states in his famous work, Durr al-Mukhtar: It is not permissible for a man to adorn himself with any type of gold and silver whatsoever (mutlaqan) besides a silver ring(Radd al-Muhtar ala al-Durr al-Mukhtar, 6/358-359, fasl fi al-libas). Secondly, earrings are (still) generally considered a type of adornment for women and even in the West they were originally worn by those men who wanted to imitate women. Imitating women intentionally is considered unlawful in Islam. Sayyiduna Abd Allah ibn Abbas (Allah be pleased with him) relates, that the Messenger of Allah (Allah bless him & give him peace): Cursed those men who imitate women and those women who imitate men (Sahih al-Bukhari, 7/205). Thirdly, wearing earrings is a custom that developed and is generally prevalent among non-Muslim men, and imitating non-Muslims is also impermissible. Sayyiduna Abd Allah ibn Umar (Allah be pleased with him) narrates that the Messenger of Allah (Allah bless him & give him peace) said: Whoever imitates a people is one of them. (Sunan Abu Dawud, no. 4031 & Musnad Ahmad, 2/50) Given the above reasons, it would not be permissible for men to wear and adorn themselves with earrings", "Document": "Narrated Umm Salamah, Ummul Muminin:When the verse \"That they should cast their outer garments over their persons\" was revealed, the women of Ansar came out as if they had crows over their heads by wearing outer garments.<D>Narrated Umm Salamah, Ummul Muminin:When the verse \"That they should cast their outer garments over their persons\" was revealed, the women of Ansar came out as if they had crows over their heads by wearing outer garments.<D>Narrated Imran ibn Husayn:The Prophet () said: I do not ride on purple, or wear a garment dyed with saffron, or wear shirt hemmed with silk.

But when she is with her husband, she may use any perfume she wishes.<D>((Pharaoh) said unto those around him) of attendants: (Hear ye not) what Moses says?

The person asking is considering converting to Islam and is currently wearing wooden earrings. I told them that there isn't a complete consensus on this, but that men imitating women and wearing gold is forbidden. They also mentioned seeing Arabian and African Muslim tribesmen wearing earrings, though not gold ones.\n\nFirst, I should break down the key points:\n\n1. **Imitation of Women (Tashabbuh):** Islamic teachings emphasize that men should not imitate women and vice versa. This is based on hadiths where the Prophet (peace be upon him) condemned such behavior. So, if wearing earrings is considered an act of imitation, that might be a problem.\n\n2. **Wearing Gold:** There's a clear prohibition for men to wear gold. This is based on several hadiths where the Prophet specifically forbade men from wearing gold jewelry. So if the earrings are made of gold, that's definitely not allowed.\n\n3. **Material of Earrings:** The person is wearing wooden earrings, not gold. So the material here isn't the issue. But the act of wearing earrings itself could be controversial.\n\n4. **Cultural Practices:** I recall that some Muslim cultures, like certain Arabian and African tribes, do wear earrings. However, I think those are typically not gold. But does that make it permissible, or is it just a cultural practice that's tolerated?\n\nNow, I need to look into classical fiqh sources to see what the scholars say. I remember that scholars from the four main schools of thought (Hanafi, Maliki, Shafi'i, Hanbali) have different opinions on this.\n\n- **Hanafi School:** I think they might be more permissive. Maybe they allow men to wear silver earrings, as silver isn't prohibited for men. But I'm not sure if they allow any earrings at all or only under certain conditions.\n\n- **Maliki School:** I believe Malik ibn Anas was stricter. He might have prohibited earrings for men, considering it an act of imitation of women. So in the Maliki view, it might not be allowed at all.\n\n- **Shafi'i School:** I'm not too sure about the Shafi'i stance. Maybe they have a middle approach, allowing non-gold earrings but discouraging if it leads to resembling women.\n\n- **Hanbali School:** Hanbali scholars are usually more"}

Let me start by understanding what napaak means. From what I remember, napaak refers to something that's impure or unclean, especially in a religious context, like in Islam. So, if clothes have a few drops of urine on them, they're definitely napaak.\n\nNow, the situation is that these impure clothes got wet with water and accidentally touched some clean, wet clothes that just came out of the washing machine and were put out to dry. I need to figure out if the clean clothes are now considered impure and if I have to wash them again before wearing them.\n\nI think the first step is to consider the principles of purification in Islam. I remember that for something to be purified, it needs to be washed thoroughly. If a clean item comes into contact with an impure one, especially if both are wet, the clean one might become impure. But I'm not entirely sure about the specifics.\n\nSo, in this case, the napaak clothes have urine, which is impure, and they're wet. The clean clothes are also wet, just out of the machine. When they touch, does the impurity transfer? I think if both are wet, the impurity can transfer because moisture can act as a medium for impurity.\n\nWait, but I also recall that if the impure substance is only a few drops, maybe it's not enough to make the entire garment impure. Or perhaps it's about the intention and whether the impurity has spread. I'm a bit confused here.\n\nI should also consider the quantity of the impure substance. A few drops might not be enough to make the entire garment impure, but since it's urine, which is considered impure, even a small amount might matter. Also, the fact that both clothes are wet could mean that the impurity spreads more easily.\n\nI think the safest approach is to wash the clean clothes again to ensure they're pure. But I'm not sure if it's strictly necessary or if there's some leniency. Maybe I should look up some Islamic rulings or fatwas on this topic to confirm.\n\nAnother thing to consider is the type of fabric. If the clean clothes are made of a thick material that doesn't absorb much, maybe the impurity didn't penetrate deeply. But since they were just washed and are wet, the fabric might be more prone to absorbing"}

And Allah Taala ( ) knows best", "Document": "Narrated Aisha:(The wife of the Prophet) Whenever Allahs Apostle intended to go on a journey, he used to draw lots among his wives and would take with him the one on whom the lot had fallen. Once he drew lots when he wanted to carry out a Ghazwa, and the lot came upon me. So I proceeded with Allahs Apostle after Allahs order of veiling (the women) had been revealed and thus I was carried in my howdah (on a camel) and dismounted while still in it. We carried on our journey, and when Allahs Apostle had finished his Ghazwa and returned and we approached Medina, Allahs Apostle ordered to proceed at night. When the army was ordered to resume the homeward journey, I got up and walked on till I left the army (camp) behind. When I had answered the call of nature, I went towards my howdah, but behold ! A necklace of mine made of Jaz Azfar (a kind of black bead) was broken and I looked for it and my search for it detained me. The group of people who used to carry me, came and carried my howdah on to the back of my camel on which I was riding, considering that I was therein. At that time women were light in weight and were not fleshy for they used to eat little (food), so those people did not feel the lightness of the howdah while raising it up, and I was still a young lady. They drove away the camel and proceeded. Then I found my necklace after the army had gone. I came to their camp but found nobody therein so I went to the place where I used to stay, thinking that they would miss me and come back in my search. While I was sitting at my place, I felt sleepy and slept. Safwan bin Al-Muattil As-Sulami Adh- Dhakw-ani was behind the army. He had started in the last part of the night and reached my stationing place in the morning and saw the figure of a sleeping person. He came to me and recognized me on seeing me for he used to see me before veiling. I got up because of his saying: \"Inna Li l-lahi wa inna ilaihi rajiun,\" which he uttered on recognizing me. I covered my face with my garment, and by Allah, he did not say to me a single word except, \"Inna Li l-lahi wa inna ilaihi rajiun,\" till he made his shecamel kneel down whereupon he trod on its forelegs and I mounted it. Then Safwan set out, leading the she-camel that was carrying me, till we met the army while they were resting during the hot midday. Then whoever was meant for destruction, fell in destruction, and the leader of the Ifk (forged statement) was `Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul. After this we arrived at Medina and I became ill for one month while the people were spreading the forged statements of the people of the Ifk, and I was not aware of anything thereof. But what aroused my doubt while I was sick, was that I was no longer receiving from Allahs Apostle the same kindness as I used to receive when I fell sick. Allahs Apostle would enter upon me, say a greeting and add, \"How is that (lady)?\" and then depart. That aroused my suspicion but I was not aware of the propagated evil till I recovered from my ailment. I went out with Um Mistah to answer the call of nature towards Al-Manasi, the place where we used to relieve ourselves, and used not to go out for this purpose except from night to night, and that was before we had lavatories close to our houses. And this habit of ours was similar to the habit of the old Arabs (in the deserts or in the tents) concerning the evacuation of the bowels, for we considered it troublesome and harmful to take lavatories in the houses. So I went out with Um Mistah who was the daughter of Abi Ruhm bin `Abd Manaf, and her mother was daughter of Sakhr bin Amir who was the aunt of Abi Bakr As-Siddiq, and her son was Mistah bin Uthatha. When we had finished our affair, Um Mistah and I came back towards my house. Um Mistah stumbled over her robe whereupon she said, \"Let Mistah be ruined ! \" I said to her, \"What a bad word you have said! Do you abuse a man who has taken part in the Battle of Badr? She said, \"O you there! Didnt you hear what he has said?\" I said, \"And what did he say?\" She then told me the statement of the people of the Ifk (forged statement) which added to my ailment. When I returned home, Allahs Apostle came to me, and after greeting, he said, \"How is that (lady)?\" I said, \"Will you allow me to go to my parents?\" At that time I intended to be sure of the news through them. Allahs Apostle allowed me and I went to my parents and asked my mother, \"O my mother! What are the people talking about?\" My mother said, \"O my daughter! Take it easy, for by Allah, there is no charming lady who is loved by her husband who has other wives as well, but that those wives would find fault with her.\" I said, \"Subhan Allah! Did the people really talk about that?\" That night I kept on weeping the whole night till the morning. My tears never stopped, nor did I sleep, and morning broke while I was still weeping, Allahs Apostle called `Ali bin Abi Talib and Usama bin Zaid when the Divine Inspiration delayed, in order to consult them as to the idea of divorcing his wife. Usama bin Zaid told Allahs Apostle of what he knew about the innocence of his wife and of his affection he kept for her. He said, \"O Allahs Apostle! She is your wife, and we do not know anything about her except good.\" But `Ali bin Abi Talib said, \"O Allahs Apostle! Allah does not impose restrictions on you; and there are plenty of women other than her. If you however, ask (her) slave girl, she will tell you the truth.\" `Aisha added: So Allahs Apostle called for Barira and said, \"O Barira! Did you ever see anything which might have aroused your suspicion? (as regards Aisha). Barira said, \"By Allah Who has sent you with the truth, I have never seen anything regarding Aisha which I would blame her for except that she is a girl of immature age who sometimes sleeps and leaves the dough of her family unprotected so that the domestic goats come and eat it.\" So Allahs Apostle got up (and addressed) the people an asked for somebody who would take revenge on `Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul then. Allahs Apostle, while on the pulpit, said, \"O Muslims! Who will help me against a man who has hurt me by slandering my family? By Allah, I know nothing except good about my family, and people have blamed a man of whom I know nothing except good, and he never used to visit my family except with me,\" Sa`d bin Mu`adh Al-Ansari got up and said, \"O Allahs Apostle! By Allah, I will relieve you from him. If he be from the tribe of (Bani) Al-Aus, then I will chop his head off; and if he be from our brethren, the Khazraj, then you give us your order and we will obey it.\" On that, Sa`d bin Ubada got up, and he was the chief of the Khazraj, and before this incident he had been a pious man but he was incited by his zeal for his tribe. He said to Sa`d (bin Mu`adh), \"By Allah the Eternal, you have told a lie! You shall not kill him and you will never be able to kill him!\" On that, Usaid bin Hudair, the cousin of Sa`d (bin Mu`adh) got up and said to Sa`d bin Ubada, \"You are a liar! By Allah the Eternal, we will surely kill him; and you are a hypocrite defending the hypocrites!\" So the two tribes of Al-Aus and Al-Khazraj got excited till they were on the point of fighting with each other while Allahs Apostle was standing on the pulpit. Allahs Apostle continued quietening them till they became silent whereupon he became silent too. On that day I kept on weeping so much that neither did my tears stop, nor could I sleep. In the morning my parents were with me, and I had wept for two nights and a day without sleeping and with incessant tears till they thought that my liver would burst with weeping. While they were with me and I was weeping, an Ansari woman asked permission to see me. I admitted her and she sat and started weeping with me. While I was in that state, Allahs Apostle came to us, greeted, and sat down,. He had never sat with me since the day what was said, was said. He had stayed a month without receiving any Divine Inspiration concerning my case. Allahs Apostle recited the Tashahhud after he had sat down, and then said, \"Thereafter, O `Aisha! I have been informed such and-such a thing about you; and if you are innocent, Allah will reveal your innocence, and if you have committed a sin, then ask for Allahs forgiveness and repent to Him, for when a slave confesses his sin and then repents to Allah, Allah accepts his repentance.\" When Allahs Apostle had finished his speech, my tears ceased completely so that I no longer felt even a drop thereof. Then I said to my father, \"Reply to Allahs Apostle on my behalf as to what he said.\" He said, \"By Allah, I do not know what to say to Allahs Apostle.\" Then I said to my mother, \"Reply to Allahs Apostle.\" She said, \"I do not know what to say to Allahs Apostle.\" Still a young girl as I was and though I had little knowledge of Quran, I said, \"By Allah, I know that you heard this story (of the Ifk) so much so that it has been planted in your minds and you have believed it. So now, if I tell you that I am innocent, and Allah knows that I am innocent, you will not believe me; and if I confess something, and Allah knows that I am innocent of it, you will believe me. By Allah, I cannot find of you an example except that of Josephs father: \"So (for me) patience is most fitting against that which you assert and it is Allah (Alone) Whose help can be sought. Then I turned away and lay on my bed, and at that time I knew that I was innocent and that Allah would reveal my innocence. But by Allah, I never thought that Allah would sent down about my affair, Divine Inspiration that would be recited (forever), as I considered myself too unworthy to be talked of by Allah with something that was to be recited: but I hoped that Allahs Apostle might have a vision in which Allah would prove my innocence. By Allah, Allahs Apostle had not left his seat and nobody had left the house when the Divine Inspiration came to Allahs Apostle . So there overtook him the same hard condition which used to overtake him (when he was Divinely Inspired) so that the drops of his sweat were running down, like pearls, though it was a (cold) winter day, and that was because of the heaviness of the Statement which was revealed to him. When that state of Allahs Apostle was over, and he was smiling when he was relieved, the first word he said was, \"Aisha, Allah has declared your innocence.\" My mother said to me, \"Get up and go to him.\" I said, \"By Allah, I will not go to him and I will not thank anybody but Allah.\" So Allah revealed: \"Verily! They who spread the Slander are a gang among you. Think it not....\" (24.11-20). When Allah revealed this to confirm my innocence, Abu Bakr As-Siddiq who used to provide for Mistah bin Uthatha because of the latters kinship to him and his poverty, said, \"By Allah, I will never provide for Mistah anything after what he has said about Aisha\". So Allah revealed: (continued...) (continuing... 1): -6.274:... ... \"Let not those among you who are good and are wealthy swear not to give (help) to their kinsmen, those in need, and those who have left their homes for Allahs Cause. Let them Pardon and forgive (i.e. do not punish them). Do you not love that should forgive you? Verily Allah is Oft-forgiving. Most Merciful.\" (24.22) Abu Bakr said, \"Yes, by Allah, I wish that Allah should forgive me.\" So he resumed giving Mistah the aid he used to give him before and said, \"By Allah, I will never withold it from him at all.\" Aisha further said: Allahs Apostle also asked Zainab bint Jahsh about my case. He said, \"O Zainab! What have you seen?\" She replied, \"O Allahs Apostle! I protect my hearing and my sight (by refraining from telling lies). I know nothing but good (about Aisha).\" Of all the wives of Allahs Apostle, it was Zainab who aspired to receive from him the same favor as I used to receive, yet, Allah saved her (from telling lies) because of her piety. But her sister, Hamna, kept on fighting on her behalf so she was destroyed as were those who invented and spread the slander.<D>Narrated Aisha:(the wife of the Prophet) \"Whenever Allahs Apostle intended to go on a journey, he would draw lots amongst his wives and would take with him the one upon whom the lot fell. During a Ghazwa of his, he drew lots amongst us and the lot fell upon me, and I proceeded with him after Allah had decreed the use of the veil by women. I was carried in a Howdah (on the camel) and dismounted while still in it. When Allahs Apostle was through with his Ghazwa and returned home, and we approached the city of Medina, Allahs Apostle ordered us to proceed at night. When the order of setting off was given, I walked till I was past the army to answer the call of nature. After finishing I returned (to the camp) to depart (with the others) and suddenly realized that my necklace over my chest was missing. So, I returned to look for it and was delayed because of that. The people who used to carry me on the camel, came to my Howdah and put it on the back of the camel, thinking that I was in it, as, at that time, women were light in weight, and thin and lean, and did not use to eat much. So, those people did not feel the difference in the heaviness of the Howdah while lifting it, and they put it over the camel. At that time I was a young lady. They set the camel moving and proceeded on. I found my necklace after the army had gone, and came to their camp to find nobody. So, I went to the place where I used to stay, thinking that they would discover my absence and come back in my search. While in that state, I felt sleepy and slept. Safwan bin Muattal As-Sulami Adh-Dhakwani was behind the army and reached my abode in the morning. When he saw a sleeping person, he came to me, and he used to see me before veiling. So, I got up when I heard him saying, \"Inna lil-lah-wa inn a ilaihi rajiun (We are for Allah, and we will return to Him).\" He made his camel knell down. He got down from his camel, and put his leg on the front legs of the camel and then I rode and sat over it. Safwan set out walking, leading the camel by the rope till we reached the army who had halted to take rest at midday. Then whoever was meant for destruction, fell into destruction, (some people accused me falsely) and the leader of the false accusers was `Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul. After that we returned to Medina, and I became ill for one month while the people were spreading the forged statements of the false accusers. I was feeling during my ailment as if I were not receiving the usual kindness from the Prophet which I used to receive from him when I got sick. But he would come, greet and say, How is that (girl)? I did not know anything of what was going on till I recovered from my ailment and went out with Um Mistah to the Manasi where we used to answer the call of nature, and we used not to go to answer the call of nature except from night to night and that was before we had lavatories near to our houses. And this habit of ours was similar to the habit of the old Arabs in the open country (or away from houses). So. I and Um Mistah bint Ruhm went out walking. Um Mistah stumbled because of her long dress and on that she said, Let Mistah be ruined. I said, You are saying a bad word. Why are you abusing a man who took part in (the battle of) Badr? She said, O Hanata (you there) didnt you hear what they said? Then she told me the rumors of the false accusers. My sickness was aggravated, and when I returned home, Allahs Apostle came to me, and after greeting he said, How is that (girl)? I requested him to allow me to go to my parents. I wanted then to be sure of the news through them I Allahs Apostle allowed me, and I went to my parents and asked my mother, What are the people talking about? She said, O my daughter! Dont worry much about this matter. By Allah, never is there a charming woman loved by her husband who has other wives, but the women would forge false news about her. I said, Glorified be Allah! Are the people really taking of this matter? That night I kept on weeping and could not sleep till morning. In the morning Allahs Apostle called `Ali bin Abu Talib and Usama bin Zaid when he saw the Divine Inspiration delayed, to consul them about divorcing his wife (i.e. `Aisha). Usama bin Zaid said what he knew of the good reputation of his wives and added, O Allahs Apostle! Keep you wife, for, by Allah, we know nothing about her but good. `Ali bin Abu Talib said, O Allahs Apostle! Allah has no imposed restrictions on you, and there are many women other than she, yet you may ask the woman-servant who will tell you the truth. On that Allahs Apostle called Buraira and said, O Burair. Did you ever see anything which roused your suspicions about her? Buraira said, No, by Allah Who has sent you with the Truth, I have never seen in her anything faulty except that she is a girl of immature age, who sometimes sleeps and leaves the dough for the goats to eat. On that day Allahs Apostle ascended the pulpit and requested that somebody support him in punishing `Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul. Allahs Apostle said, Who will support me to punish that person (`Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul) who has hurt me by slandering the reputation of my family? By Allah, I know nothing about my family but good, and they have accused a person about whom I know nothing except good, and he never entered my house except in my company. Sa`d bin Mu`adh got up and said, O Allahs Apostle! by Allah, I will relieve you from him. If that man is from the tribe of the Aus, then we will chop his head off, and if he is from our brothers, the Khazraj, then order us, and we will fulfill your order. On that Sa`d bin Ubada, the chief of the Khazraj and before this incident, he had been a pious man, got up, motivated by his zeal for his tribe and said, By Allah, you have told a lie; you cannot kill him, and you will never be able to kill him. On that Usaid bin Al-Hadir got up and said (to Sa`d bin Ubada), By Allah! you are a liar. By Allah, we will kill him; and you are a hypocrite, defending the hypocrites. On this the two tribes of Aus and Khazraj got excited and were about to fight each other, while Allahs Apostle was standing on the pulpit. He got down and quieted them till they became silent and he kept quiet. On that day I kept on weeping so much so that neither did my tears stop, nor could I sleep. In the morning my parents were with me and I had wept for two nights and a day, till I thought my liver would burst from weeping. While they were sitting with me and I was weeping, an Ansari woman asked my permission to enter, and I allowed her to come in. She sat down and started weeping with me. While we were in this state, Allahs Apostle came and sat down and he had never sat with me since the day they forged the accusation. No revelation regarding my case came to him for a month. He recited Tashah-hud (i.e. None has the right to be worshipped but Allah and Muhammad is His Apostle) and then said, O `Aisha! I have been informed such-and-such about you; if you are innocent, then Allah will soon reveal your innocence, and if you have committed a sin, then repent to Allah and ask Him to forgive you, for when a person confesses his sin and asks Allah for forgiveness, Allah accepts his repentance. When Allahs Apostle finished his speech my tears ceased completely and there remained not even a single drop of it. I requested my father to reply to Allahs Apostle on my behalf. My father said, By Allah, I do not know what to say to Allahs Apostle. I said to my mother, Talk to Allahs Apostle on my behalf. She said, By Allah, I do not know what to say to Allahs Apostle. I was a young girl and did not have much knowledge of the Quran. I said. I know, by Allah, that you have listened to what people are saying and that has been planted in your minds and you have taken it as a truth. Now, if I told you that I am innocent and Allah knows that I am innocent, you would not believe me and if I confessed to you falsely that I am guilty, and Allah knows that I am innocent you would believe me. By Allah, I dont compare my situation with you except to the situation of Josephs father (i.e. Jacob) who said, So (for me) patience is most fitting against that which you assert and it is Allah (Alone) whose help can be sought. Then I turned to the other side of my bed hoping that Allah would prove my innocence. By Allah I never thought that Allah would reveal Divine Inspiration in my case, as I considered myself too inferior to be talked of in the Holy Quran. I had hoped that Allahs Apostle might have a dream in which Allah would prove my innocence. By Allah, Allahs Apostle had not got up and nobody had left the house before the Divine Inspiration came to Allahs Apostle. So, there overtook him the same state which used to overtake him, (when he used to have, on being inspired divinely). He was sweating so much so that the drops of the sweat were dropping like pearls though it was a (cold) wintry day. When that state of Allahs Apostle was over, he was smiling and the first word he said, `Aisha! Thank Allah, for Allah has declared your innocence. My mother told me to go to Allahs Apostle . I replied, By Allah I will not go to him and will not thank but Allah. So Allah revealed: \"Verily! They who spread the slander are a gang among you . . .\" (24.11) When Allah gave the declaration of my Innocence, Abu Bakr, who used to provide for Mistah bin Uthatha for he was his relative, said, By Allah, I will never provide Mistah with anything because of what he said about Aisha. But Allah later revealed: -- \"And let not those who are good and wealthy among you swear not to help their kinsmen, those in need and those who left their homes in Allahs Cause. Let them forgive and overlook. Do you not wish that Allah should forgive you? Verily! Allah is Oft-forgiving, Most Merciful.\" (24.22) After that Abu Bakr said, Yes ! By Allah! I like that Allah should forgive me, and resumed helping Mistah whom he used to help before. Allahs Apostle also asked Zainab bint Jahsh (i.e. the Prophets wife about me saying, What do you know and what did you see? She replied, O Allahs Apostle! I refrain to claim hearing or seeing what I have not heard or seen. By Allah, I know nothing except goodness about Aisha.\" Aisha further added \"Zainab was competing with me (in her beauty and the Prophets love), yet Allah protected her (from being malicious), for she had piety.\"<D>It was narraterd from Jabir bin Abdullah that, during the year of the Conquest, while he was in Makkah, he heard the Messenger of Allah say:\"Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, and His Messenger have forbidden the sale of alcohol, dead meat, pigs and idols.\" It was said to him: \"O Messenger of Allah, what do you think of their fat of dead animals, for it is used to caulk ships, it is daubed on animal skins, and people use it to light their lamps?\" He said: \"No, it is unlawful.\" Then the Messenger of Allah said: \"May Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, curse the Jews, for Allah forbade them the fat (of dead animals) but they rendered it, sold it, and consumed its price.\"<D>Then He explained to them further, saying: (A day) on a Day (when He will call you) when Seraphiel will call you upon the blowing of the trumpet (and ye will answer with His praise) you will answer the caller of Allah by His command, (and ye will think that ye have tarried but a little while) you will think that you havestayed in your graves but a short time.<D>(What then is your opinion of the Lord of the Worlds) what do you think He will do to you if you worship other than Him?<D>The following was revealed about Abu Jahl Ibn Hisham, al-Walid Ibn al-Mughirah and Utbah and Shaybah the sons of Rabiah who had duals with Ali Ibn Abi Talib, may Allah be well pleased with him, Hamzah IbnAbd al-Muttalib, the uncle of the Prophet (pbuh) and Ubaydah Ibn al-Harth Ibn Abd al-Muttalib on the Dayof Badr; some of them boasted to others, and so Allah said: (Or do those who do ill deeds) in their state of associating partners with Allah (imagine that they can outstrip Us) that they will evade Our punishment: (Evil (for them) is that which they decide) evil is that which they judge and think for themselves.", "Generated_Answer": "<think>\nOkay, so I have this problem where I'm really worried about urine splashing on my legs when I urinate. It's causing me a lot of anxiety and doubt, especially when it comes to my prayers (namaz). I take precautions like using tissue paper in the toilet to minimize splashing, but even then, I'm still paranoid. Every little movement on my leg makes me think I've been splashed, and I don't know whether to check or just ignore it. I'm scared that if I check, I might spread the urine, but if I don't, maybe it's just a small spot and my prayer would still be valid. I need some advice on how to handle this.\n\nFirst, I should understand the Islamic rulings about this. I know that for prayer, the body and clothes must be clean. If urine touches the body or clothes, it invalidates the prayer. So, if I feel something on my leg, I need to determine if it's urine. But how? If I check, I might spread it, making the problem worse. If I don't check, maybe it's just a drop, but I'm not sure.\n\nI remember reading that if there's a splatter, it's better to check. But I also read that if you're unsure, you can just wash that area and continue. Maybe I should just wash my legs every time I think there's a splash, just to be safe. But that could become a habit and cause more anxiety.\n\nI also take precautions, like using tissue, which should reduce splashing. But despite that, my anxiety makes me hyper-aware of any movement. Maybe I'm overreacting. I need to find a balance between being cautious and not letting anxiety take over.\n\nAnother thought: maybe I should focus on my intention during prayer. If I've taken all possible precautions and still have a tiny splash that I didn't notice, my prayer should still be valid because I did my best to prevent it. But I'm not entirely sure about this.\n\nI should also consider the concept of waswasa, which is whispering of the devil causing doubt. Maybe my anxiety is being exacerbated by this, and I need to strengthen my faith and not let these doubts affect me.\n\nI think talking to an imam or a scholar would help, but I'm not sure how to approach that. Alternatively, I could read more about similar cases online or in Islamic books to see how others have dealt with it.\n\nIn summary, I need to"}
{"Question": "Q: Tayammum was made for ghusal on a severe winters morning as there was no intizaam for hot water. 1. When does the Tayammum expire? 2. Does the fajr salaah need to be repeated? ? --T--", "Answer": "If the water is so cold that one fears that one will become sick and there is no means to make the water hot, then it will be permissible to make tayammum and perform Salaah. 1. The tayammum will expire once one finds water one is able to use. 2. No And Allah Taala ( ) knows best", "Document": "Shaqiq said:While I was sitting between Abd Allah and Abu Musa, the latter said: Abu Abd al-Rahman, what do you think if a man becomes defiled (because of seminal omission) and does not find water for a month; should he not perform tayammum ? He replied: No, even if he does not find water for a month. Abu Musa then said: How will you do with the Quranic version (about tayammum) in the chapter al-Maidah which says: \"... and you find no water, then go to clean, high ground\" (5:6)? Abd Allah (b. Masud) then said: If they (the people) are granted concession in this respect, they might perform tayammum with pure earth when water is cold. Abu Musa said: For this (reason) you forbade it ? He said: Yes. Abu Musa then said: Did you not hear what Ammar said to Umar ? (He said): The Messenger of Allah () sent me on some errand. I had seminal emission and I did not find water. Therefore, I rolled on the ground just as an animal rolls down. I then came to the Prophet () and made a mention of that to him. He said: It would have been enough for you to do thus. Then he struck the ground with his hands and shook them off and then stuck the right hand with his left hand and his left hand with his right hand (and wiped) over his hands (up to the wrist) and wiped his face. Abd Allah then said to him: Did you not see that Umar was not satisfied with the statement of Ammar ?<D>Ammar bin Yasir narrated that :the Prophet ordered him to perform Tayammum by rubbing his face and two palms.<D>It is reported that Ata did not approve of performing ablution with milk and nabidh and said:tayammum is more my liking (than performing ablution with milk and nabidh).<D>(And that He it is Who enricheth) He made Himself independent of the need for created beings (and contenteth) and He made His slaves needy for Him; it is also said that this means: He made some rich with gold and silver and others content with the possession of camels, bovines and sheep.<D>(And if ye fear that ye will not deal fairly by the orphans) and if you fear that you will not preserve orphans wealth, you should also fear not dealing fairly with women in relation to providing sustenance and apportionment. This was because they used to marry as many women as they liked, as many as nine or ten. Qays Ibn al-Harth for example had eight wives. Allah forbade them from doing so and prohibited them from marrying more than four wives, saying: (marry of the women, who seem good to you) marry that which Allah has made lawful for you, (two or three or four) marry one, two, three or four but do not marry more than four wives; (and if ye fear that ye cannot do justice) to four wives in relation to apportionment and providing sustenance (then one (only)) then marry only one free woman (or that your right hands possess) of captives, and in that case you do not owe them any apportionment, and they need not observe any waiting period. (Thus it) marrying just one woman (is more likely that ye will not do injustice) that you will not incline to some at the expense of others or that you transgress regarding the provision of sustenanceand apportionment to four wives.<D>(Know that Allah is severe in punishment) towards him who declares lawful that which Allah has made unlawful, (but that Allah (also) is Forgiving) He overlooks mistakes, (Merciful) towards the person who repents.", "Generated_Answer": "<think>\nOkay, so I have this question about Tayammum and Ghusal in Islam. Let me try to figure this out step by step. \n\nFirst, I know that Tayammum is a substitute for Wudu or Ghusal when water isn't available or can't be used. The person in the question used Tayammum because it was a severe winter morning and they couldn't get hot water for Ghusal. That makes sense because using very cold water might be harmful, so Tayammum is allowed as a replacement.\n\nNow, the first question is when does the Tayammum expire. From what I remember, Tayammum acts as a substitute for Wudu or Ghusal, but it doesn't last as long. So, if you do Tayammum, you can perform your prayer with it, but it doesn't mean you’re in a state of Wudu for an extended period. Once you finish your prayer, the Tayammum ends. So, for Fajr prayer, once you do the Salaah, the Tayammum expires, and you’d need to renew your Wudu if you want to pray again or do anything that requires it.\n\nThe second question is whether the Fajr Salaah needs to be repeated. Since the person used Tayammum correctly because they couldn’t use water, their prayer should be valid. There's no need to repeat it unless they did something wrong during the prayer that would invalidate it, but that’s unrelated to the Tayammum itself.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused. Does Tayammum expire immediately after the prayer, or does it have a specific duration? I think it's the former. Tayammum is for one act of worship, like one prayer, so after that, you’re no longer considered in a state of Wudu. So, if you pray Fajr, then the Tayammum is done, and you'd need to perform Wudu again for any subsequent prayers or actions requiring purity.\n\nAlso, I should consider if there are any specific rules about Ghusal. Ghusal is required for certain impurities like Janaba (after intimacy or ejaculation). If the person needed Ghusal because of Janaba, then using Tayammum would be a temporary solution. But once they can, they should perform Ghusal as soon as possible. But in terms of the prayer, the Fajr Salaah done with Tayammum is valid and doesn't need repetition.\n\nSo, to"}

But since the raincoat is waterproof, maybe it's holding onto more water than the other clothes. That could be why it's dripping more. But does that mean it's not clean?\n\nI remember that waterproof fabrics are designed to repel water, so maybe during the wash, the detergent didn't penetrate as well as it did with the other clothes. But the other clothes are just wet, not dripping, so they must have gone through the spin cycle properly. Wait, but if the raincoat is dripping, does that mean it didn't spin as much? Or maybe the material doesn't release water as easily.\n\nI should consider whether the detergent was effective on the raincoat. If the water didn't soak into the fabric, maybe the dirt wasn't removed properly. But the rest of the clothes seem fine. Maybe the raincoat just needs a different wash setting, like a gentler cycle or maybe a longer spin.\n\nI also wonder if the raincoat's waterproof coating could affect how it's cleaned. Maybe it's better to wash it separately or use a specific detergent. I'm not sure if the machine's rinse cycle was enough to get all the detergent out, especially from a waterproof material. If there's detergent residue, that might not be good, but that's more about being clean than actually being dirty.\n\nSo, in summary, the rest of the clothes are probably clean because they're just wet. The raincoat is dripping because it's waterproof, but whether it's clean depends on how well the wash cycle worked on that material. Maybe I should check if the raincoat smells clean or if there are visible stains. If it looks and smells clean, then it probably is. If not, maybe I need to wash it again with a different setting or detergent.\n\nI'm also thinking about whether the spin cycle was effective. If the raincoat is heavy, maybe it didn't spin as much, leaving more water. But that wouldn't necessarily mean it's not clean. It might just need more time to dry or a different way of drying.\n\nI should also consider if the washing machine's settings were appropriate for waterproof materials."}
{"Question": "If a person sees a young woman she knows doing something haram with another boy (right infront of her eyes), does she have to tell the girls parents? Should she say nothing because she was the only one who saw?? --T--", "Answer": "Al-Salam alaykumIn such a case it is necessary that she fulfils her responsibility of stopping evil by doing what is in her capacity i.e. telling those who will be able to effect some reform viz. the girls parents. This will not be regarded as ghibah (backbiting) as the intention is to reform. [Faraz adds: Imam Abul Layth al-Samarqandi mentioned that things said out of genuine concern are not backbiting (ghiba), as in Sharhal-Tariqa al-Muhammadiyya and elsewhere", "Document": "Sa, id b. jubair reported that it was said to Ibn Abbas that Nauf al-Bikali was of the opinion that Moses who went in search of knowledge was not the Moses of Bani Israil. He said:Said, did you hear it from him? I said: Yes. Thereupon he said that Nauf had not stated the fact. Ubayy b. Kab narrated to us that he had heard Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: Moses had been delivering sermons to his people. And he made this remark: No person upon the earth has better knowledge than I or nothing better than mine. Thereupon Allah revealed to him: I know one who is better than you (in knowledge) or there is a person on the earth having more knowledge than you. Thereupon he said: My Lord, direct me to him. It was said to him: Keep a salted fish as a provision for journey. The place where that fish would be lost (there you will find that man). So he set forth and a young slave along with him until they came to a place Sakhra. but he did not find any clue. So he proceeded on and left that young man there. The fish began to stir in water and the water assumed the form of an ark over the fish. The young man said: I should meet Allahs Apostle (peace be upon him) and inform him, but he was made to forget and when they had gone beyond that place, he (Moses) said to the young man: Bring breakfast. We have been exhausted because of the journey, and he (Moses) was not exhausted until he had crossed that (particular) place (where he had) to meet Khadir, and the youth was reminded and said: Did you not see that as we reached Sakhra I forgot the fish and it is satan alone who has made me forgetful of it? It is strange that he has been able to find way in the ocean too. He said: This is what we sought for us. They returned retracing their steps, and he (his companion) pointed to him the location (where) the fish (had been lost). Moses began to search him there. He suddenly saw Khadir wrapped in a cloth and lying on his back. He said to him: As-Salamu-Alaikum. He removed the cloth from his face and said: Wa Alaikum-us-Salam! Who are you? He said: I am Moses. He said: Who Moses? He said: Moses Of Bani Israil. He said: What brought you here? He said: I have come so that you may teach me what you have been taught of righteousness. He said: You shall have to bear with me, and how can you have patience about a thing of which you have no comprehensive knowledge? You will not have patience when you see me doing a thing I have been ordered to do. He said: If Allah pleases, you will find me patient, nor shall I disobey you in aught. Khadir said: If you follow me, dont ask me about anything until I explain it to you. So they went on until they embarked upon a boat. He (Khadir) made a hole in that. Thereupon he (Moses) said: You have done this so that you may drown the persons sitting in the boat. You have done something grievous. Thereupon he said: Did I not tell you that you will not be able to bear with me? Thereupon he (Moses) said: Blame me not for what I forgot and be not hard upon me for what I did. (Khadir gave him another chance.) So they went on until they reached a place where boys were playing. He went to one of them and caught holdof one (apparently) at random and killed him. Moses (peace be upon him) felt agitated and said: You have killed an innocent person not guilty of slaying another. You have done something aboininable. Thereupon Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: May Allah have mercy upon us and Moses. Had he shown patience he would have seen wonderful things, but fear of blame, with respect to his companion, seized him and he said: If I ask anything after this, keep not company with me. You will then have a valid excuse in my case, and had he (Moses) shown patience he would have seen many wonderful things. He (the narrator) said: Whenever he (the Holy Prophet) made mention of any Prophet, he always said: May there be mercy of Allah upon us and upon my brother so and so. They, however, proceeded on until they came to the inhabitants of a village who were very miserly. They went to the meeting places and asked for hospitality but they refused to show any hospitality to them. They both found in that village a wall which was about to fall. He (Khadir) set it right. Thereupon he (Moses) said: If you so liked. you could get wages for it. Thereupon he said: This is the partince, of ways between me and you, and, taking hold of his cloth, he said: Now I will explain to you the real significance (of all these acts) for which you could not show patience. As for the boat, it belonged to the poor people working on the river and I intended to damage it for there was ahead of them (a king) who seized boats by force. (When he came) to catch hold of it he found it a damaged boat, so he spared it (and later on) it was set right with wood. So far as the boy is concerned, he has been, by very nature, an unbeliever, whereas his parents loved him very much. Had he grown up he would have involved them in wrongdoing and unbelief, so we wished that their Lord should give them in its place one better in purity and close to mercy. And as for the wall it belonged to two orphan boys in the city and there was beneath it a (treasure) belongin to them,... up to the last verse. This hadith has been transmitted on the authority of Abu Ishaq.<D>Narrated Aisha:(The wife of the Prophet) Whenever Allahs Apostle intended to go on a journey, he used to draw lots among his wives and would take with him the one on whom the lot had fallen. Once he drew lots when he wanted to carry out a Ghazwa, and the lot came upon me. So I proceeded with Allahs Apostle after Allahs order of veiling (the women) had been revealed and thus I was carried in my howdah (on a camel) and dismounted while still in it. We carried on our journey, and when Allahs Apostle had finished his Ghazwa and returned and we approached Medina, Allahs Apostle ordered to proceed at night. When the army was ordered to resume the homeward journey, I got up and walked on till I left the army (camp) behind. When I had answered the call of nature, I went towards my howdah, but behold ! A necklace of mine made of Jaz Azfar (a kind of black bead) was broken and I looked for it and my search for it detained me. The group of people who used to carry me, came and carried my howdah on to the back of my camel on which I was riding, considering that I was therein. At that time women were light in weight and were not fleshy for they used to eat little (food), so those people did not feel the lightness of the howdah while raising it up, and I was still a young lady. They drove away the camel and proceeded. Then I found my necklace after the army had gone. I came to their camp but found nobody therein so I went to the place where I used to stay, thinking that they would miss me and come back in my search. While I was sitting at my place, I felt sleepy and slept. Safwan bin Al-Muattil As-Sulami Adh- Dhakw-ani was behind the army. He had started in the last part of the night and reached my stationing place in the morning and saw the figure of a sleeping person. He came to me and recognized me on seeing me for he used to see me before veiling. I got up because of his saying: \"Inna Li l-lahi wa inna ilaihi rajiun,\" which he uttered on recognizing me. I covered my face with my garment, and by Allah, he did not say to me a single word except, \"Inna Li l-lahi wa inna ilaihi rajiun,\" till he made his shecamel kneel down whereupon he trod on its forelegs and I mounted it. Then Safwan set out, leading the she-camel that was carrying me, till we met the army while they were resting during the hot midday. Then whoever was meant for destruction, fell in destruction, and the leader of the Ifk (forged statement) was `Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul. After this we arrived at Medina and I became ill for one month while the people were spreading the forged statements of the people of the Ifk, and I was not aware of anything thereof. But what aroused my doubt while I was sick, was that I was no longer receiving from Allahs Apostle the same kindness as I used to receive when I fell sick. Allahs Apostle would enter upon me, say a greeting and add, \"How is that (lady)?\" and then depart. That aroused my suspicion but I was not aware of the propagated evil till I recovered from my ailment. I went out with Um Mistah to answer the call of nature towards Al-Manasi, the place where we used to relieve ourselves, and used not to go out for this purpose except from night to night, and that was before we had lavatories close to our houses. And this habit of ours was similar to the habit of the old Arabs (in the deserts or in the tents) concerning the evacuation of the bowels, for we considered it troublesome and harmful to take lavatories in the houses. So I went out with Um Mistah who was the daughter of Abi Ruhm bin `Abd Manaf, and her mother was daughter of Sakhr bin Amir who was the aunt of Abi Bakr As-Siddiq, and her son was Mistah bin Uthatha. When we had finished our affair, Um Mistah and I came back towards my house. Um Mistah stumbled over her robe whereupon she said, \"Let Mistah be ruined ! \" I said to her, \"What a bad word you have said! Do you abuse a man who has taken part in the Battle of Badr? She said, \"O you there! Didnt you hear what he has said?\" I said, \"And what did he say?\" She then told me the statement of the people of the Ifk (forged statement) which added to my ailment. When I returned home, Allahs Apostle came to me, and after greeting, he said, \"How is that (lady)?\" I said, \"Will you allow me to go to my parents?\" At that time I intended to be sure of the news through them. Allahs Apostle allowed me and I went to my parents and asked my mother, \"O my mother! What are the people talking about?\" My mother said, \"O my daughter! Take it easy, for by Allah, there is no charming lady who is loved by her husband who has other wives as well, but that those wives would find fault with her.\" I said, \"Subhan Allah! Did the people really talk about that?\" That night I kept on weeping the whole night till the morning. My tears never stopped, nor did I sleep, and morning broke while I was still weeping, Allahs Apostle called `Ali bin Abi Talib and Usama bin Zaid when the Divine Inspiration delayed, in order to consult them as to the idea of divorcing his wife. Usama bin Zaid told Allahs Apostle of what he knew about the innocence of his wife and of his affection he kept for her. He said, \"O Allahs Apostle! She is your wife, and we do not know anything about her except good.\" But `Ali bin Abi Talib said, \"O Allahs Apostle! Allah does not impose restrictions on you; and there are plenty of women other than her. If you however, ask (her) slave girl, she will tell you the truth.\" `Aisha added: So Allahs Apostle called for Barira and said, \"O Barira! Did you ever see anything which might have aroused your suspicion? (as regards Aisha). Barira said, \"By Allah Who has sent you with the truth, I have never seen anything regarding Aisha which I would blame her for except that she is a girl of immature age who sometimes sleeps and leaves the dough of her family unprotected so that the domestic goats come and eat it.\" So Allahs Apostle got up (and addressed) the people an asked for somebody who would take revenge on `Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul then. Allahs Apostle, while on the pulpit, said, \"O Muslims! Who will help me against a man who has hurt me by slandering my family? By Allah, I know nothing except good about my family, and people have blamed a man of whom I know nothing except good, and he never used to visit my family except with me,\" Sa`d bin Mu`adh Al-Ansari got up and said, \"O Allahs Apostle! By Allah, I will relieve you from him. If he be from the tribe of (Bani) Al-Aus, then I will chop his head off; and if he be from our brethren, the Khazraj, then you give us your order and we will obey it.\" On that, Sa`d bin Ubada got up, and he was the chief of the Khazraj, and before this incident he had been a pious man but he was incited by his zeal for his tribe. He said to Sa`d (bin Mu`adh), \"By Allah the Eternal, you have told a lie! You shall not kill him and you will never be able to kill him!\" On that, Usaid bin Hudair, the cousin of Sa`d (bin Mu`adh) got up and said to Sa`d bin Ubada, \"You are a liar! By Allah the Eternal, we will surely kill him; and you are a hypocrite defending the hypocrites!\" So the two tribes of Al-Aus and Al-Khazraj got excited till they were on the point of fighting with each other while Allahs Apostle was standing on the pulpit. Allahs Apostle continued quietening them till they became silent whereupon he became silent too. On that day I kept on weeping so much that neither did my tears stop, nor could I sleep. In the morning my parents were with me, and I had wept for two nights and a day without sleeping and with incessant tears till they thought that my liver would burst with weeping. While they were with me and I was weeping, an Ansari woman asked permission to see me. I admitted her and she sat and started weeping with me. While I was in that state, Allahs Apostle came to us, greeted, and sat down,. He had never sat with me since the day what was said, was said. He had stayed a month without receiving any Divine Inspiration concerning my case. Allahs Apostle recited the Tashahhud after he had sat down, and then said, \"Thereafter, O `Aisha! I have been informed such and-such a thing about you; and if you are innocent, Allah will reveal your innocence, and if you have committed a sin, then ask for Allahs forgiveness and repent to Him, for when a slave confesses his sin and then repents to Allah, Allah accepts his repentance.\" When Allahs Apostle had finished his speech, my tears ceased completely so that I no longer felt even a drop thereof. Then I said to my father, \"Reply to Allahs Apostle on my behalf as to what he said.\" He said, \"By Allah, I do not know what to say to Allahs Apostle.\" Then I said to my mother, \"Reply to Allahs Apostle.\" She said, \"I do not know what to say to Allahs Apostle.\" Still a young girl as I was and though I had little knowledge of Quran, I said, \"By Allah, I know that you heard this story (of the Ifk) so much so that it has been planted in your minds and you have believed it. So now, if I tell you that I am innocent, and Allah knows that I am innocent, you will not believe me; and if I confess something, and Allah knows that I am innocent of it, you will believe me. By Allah, I cannot find of you an example except that of Josephs father: \"So (for me) patience is most fitting against that which you assert and it is Allah (Alone) Whose help can be sought. Then I turned away and lay on my bed, and at that time I knew that I was innocent and that Allah would reveal my innocence. But by Allah, I never thought that Allah would sent down about my affair, Divine Inspiration that would be recited (forever), as I considered myself too unworthy to be talked of by Allah with something that was to be recited: but I hoped that Allahs Apostle might have a vision in which Allah would prove my innocence. By Allah, Allahs Apostle had not left his seat and nobody had left the house when the Divine Inspiration came to Allahs Apostle . So there overtook him the same hard condition which used to overtake him (when he was Divinely Inspired) so that the drops of his sweat were running down, like pearls, though it was a (cold) winter day, and that was because of the heaviness of the Statement which was revealed to him. When that state of Allahs Apostle was over, and he was smiling when he was relieved, the first word he said was, \"Aisha, Allah has declared your innocence.\" My mother said to me, \"Get up and go to him.\" I said, \"By Allah, I will not go to him and I will not thank anybody but Allah.\" So Allah revealed: \"Verily! They who spread the Slander are a gang among you. Think it not....\" (24.11-20). When Allah revealed this to confirm my innocence, Abu Bakr As-Siddiq who used to provide for Mistah bin Uthatha because of the latters kinship to him and his poverty, said, \"By Allah, I will never provide for Mistah anything after what he has said about Aisha\". So Allah revealed: (continued...) (continuing... 1): -6.274:... ... \"Let not those among you who are good and are wealthy swear not to give (help) to their kinsmen, those in need, and those who have left their homes for Allahs Cause. Let them Pardon and forgive (i.e. do not punish them). Do you not love that should forgive you? Verily Allah is Oft-forgiving. Most Merciful.\" (24.22) Abu Bakr said, \"Yes, by Allah, I wish that Allah should forgive me.\" So he resumed giving Mistah the aid he used to give him before and said, \"By Allah, I will never withold it from him at all.\" Aisha further said: Allahs Apostle also asked Zainab bint Jahsh about my case. He said, \"O Zainab! What have you seen?\" She replied, \"O Allahs Apostle! I protect my hearing and my sight (by refraining from telling lies). I know nothing but good (about Aisha).\" Of all the wives of Allahs Apostle, it was Zainab who aspired to receive from him the same favor as I used to receive, yet, Allah saved her (from telling lies) because of her piety. But her sister, Hamna, kept on fighting on her behalf so she was destroyed as were those who invented and spread the slander.<D>Narrated Aisha:(the wife of the Prophet) \"Whenever Allahs Apostle intended to go on a journey, he would draw lots amongst his wives and would take with him the one upon whom the lot fell. During a Ghazwa of his, he drew lots amongst us and the lot fell upon me, and I proceeded with him after Allah had decreed the use of the veil by women. I was carried in a Howdah (on the camel) and dismounted while still in it. When Allahs Apostle was through with his Ghazwa and returned home, and we approached the city of Medina, Allahs Apostle ordered us to proceed at night. When the order of setting off was given, I walked till I was past the army to answer the call of nature. After finishing I returned (to the camp) to depart (with the others) and suddenly realized that my necklace over my chest was missing. So, I returned to look for it and was delayed because of that. The people who used to carry me on the camel, came to my Howdah and put it on the back of the camel, thinking that I was in it, as, at that time, women were light in weight, and thin and lean, and did not use to eat much. So, those people did not feel the difference in the heaviness of the Howdah while lifting it, and they put it over the camel. At that time I was a young lady. They set the camel moving and proceeded on. I found my necklace after the army had gone, and came to their camp to find nobody. So, I went to the place where I used to stay, thinking that they would discover my absence and come back in my search. While in that state, I felt sleepy and slept. Safwan bin Muattal As-Sulami Adh-Dhakwani was behind the army and reached my abode in the morning. When he saw a sleeping person, he came to me, and he used to see me before veiling. So, I got up when I heard him saying, \"Inna lil-lah-wa inn a ilaihi rajiun (We are for Allah, and we will return to Him).\" He made his camel knell down. He got down from his camel, and put his leg on the front legs of the camel and then I rode and sat over it. Safwan set out walking, leading the camel by the rope till we reached the army who had halted to take rest at midday. Then whoever was meant for destruction, fell into destruction, (some people accused me falsely) and the leader of the false accusers was `Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul. After that we returned to Medina, and I became ill for one month while the people were spreading the forged statements of the false accusers. I was feeling during my ailment as if I were not receiving the usual kindness from the Prophet which I used to receive from him when I got sick. But he would come, greet and say, How is that (girl)? I did not know anything of what was going on till I recovered from my ailment and went out with Um Mistah to the Manasi where we used to answer the call of nature, and we used not to go to answer the call of nature except from night to night and that was before we had lavatories near to our houses. And this habit of ours was similar to the habit of the old Arabs in the open country (or away from houses). So. I and Um Mistah bint Ruhm went out walking. Um Mistah stumbled because of her long dress and on that she said, Let Mistah be ruined. I said, You are saying a bad word. Why are you abusing a man who took part in (the battle of) Badr? She said, O Hanata (you there) didnt you hear what they said? Then she told me the rumors of the false accusers. My sickness was aggravated, and when I returned home, Allahs Apostle came to me, and after greeting he said, How is that (girl)? I requested him to allow me to go to my parents. I wanted then to be sure of the news through them I Allahs Apostle allowed me, and I went to my parents and asked my mother, What are the people talking about? She said, O my daughter! Dont worry much about this matter. By Allah, never is there a charming woman loved by her husband who has other wives, but the women would forge false news about her. I said, Glorified be Allah! Are the people really taking of this matter? That night I kept on weeping and could not sleep till morning. In the morning Allahs Apostle called `Ali bin Abu Talib and Usama bin Zaid when he saw the Divine Inspiration delayed, to consul them about divorcing his wife (i.e. `Aisha). Usama bin Zaid said what he knew of the good reputation of his wives and added, O Allahs Apostle! Keep you wife, for, by Allah, we know nothing about her but good. `Ali bin Abu Talib said, O Allahs Apostle! Allah has no imposed restrictions on you, and there are many women other than she, yet you may ask the woman-servant who will tell you the truth. On that Allahs Apostle called Buraira and said, O Burair. Did you ever see anything which roused your suspicions about her? Buraira said, No, by Allah Who has sent you with the Truth, I have never seen in her anything faulty except that she is a girl of immature age, who sometimes sleeps and leaves the dough for the goats to eat. On that day Allahs Apostle ascended the pulpit and requested that somebody support him in punishing `Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul. Allahs Apostle said, Who will support me to punish that person (`Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul) who has hurt me by slandering the reputation of my family? By Allah, I know nothing about my family but good, and they have accused a person about whom I know nothing except good, and he never entered my house except in my company. Sa`d bin Mu`adh got up and said, O Allahs Apostle! by Allah, I will relieve you from him. If that man is from the tribe of the Aus, then we will chop his head off, and if he is from our brothers, the Khazraj, then order us, and we will fulfill your order. On that Sa`d bin Ubada, the chief of the Khazraj and before this incident, he had been a pious man, got up, motivated by his zeal for his tribe and said, By Allah, you have told a lie; you cannot kill him, and you will never be able to kill him. On that Usaid bin Al-Hadir got up and said (to Sa`d bin Ubada), By Allah! you are a liar. By Allah, we will kill him; and you are a hypocrite, defending the hypocrites. On this the two tribes of Aus and Khazraj got excited and were about to fight each other, while Allahs Apostle was standing on the pulpit. He got down and quieted them till they became silent and he kept quiet. On that day I kept on weeping so much so that neither did my tears stop, nor could I sleep. In the morning my parents were with me and I had wept for two nights and a day, till I thought my liver would burst from weeping. While they were sitting with me and I was weeping, an Ansari woman asked my permission to enter, and I allowed her to come in. She sat down and started weeping with me. While we were in this state, Allahs Apostle came and sat down and he had never sat with me since the day they forged the accusation. No revelation regarding my case came to him for a month. He recited Tashah-hud (i.e. None has the right to be worshipped but Allah and Muhammad is His Apostle) and then said, O `Aisha! I have been informed such-and-such about you; if you are innocent, then Allah will soon reveal your innocence, and if you have committed a sin, then repent to Allah and ask Him to forgive you, for when a person confesses his sin and asks Allah for forgiveness, Allah accepts his repentance. When Allahs Apostle finished his speech my tears ceased completely and there remained not even a single drop of it. I requested my father to reply to Allahs Apostle on my behalf. My father said, By Allah, I do not know what to say to Allahs Apostle. I said to my mother, Talk to Allahs Apostle on my behalf. She said, By Allah, I do not know what to say to Allahs Apostle. I was a young girl and did not have much knowledge of the Quran. I said. I know, by Allah, that you have listened to what people are saying and that has been planted in your minds and you have taken it as a truth. Now, if I told you that I am innocent and Allah knows that I am innocent, you would not believe me and if I confessed to you falsely that I am guilty, and Allah knows that I am innocent you would believe me. By Allah, I dont compare my situation with you except to the situation of Josephs father (i.e. Jacob) who said, So (for me) patience is most fitting against that which you assert and it is Allah (Alone) whose help can be sought. Then I turned to the other side of my bed hoping that Allah would prove my innocence. By Allah I never thought that Allah would reveal Divine Inspiration in my case, as I considered myself too inferior to be talked of in the Holy Quran. I had hoped that Allahs Apostle might have a dream in which Allah would prove my innocence. By Allah, Allahs Apostle had not got up and nobody had left the house before the Divine Inspiration came to Allahs Apostle. So, there overtook him the same state which used to overtake him, (when he used to have, on being inspired divinely). He was sweating so much so that the drops of the sweat were dropping like pearls though it was a (cold) wintry day. When that state of Allahs Apostle was over, he was smiling and the first word he said, `Aisha! Thank Allah, for Allah has declared your innocence. My mother told me to go to Allahs Apostle . I replied, By Allah I will not go to him and will not thank but Allah. So Allah revealed: \"Verily! They who spread the slander are a gang among you . . .\" (24.11) When Allah gave the declaration of my Innocence, Abu Bakr, who used to provide for Mistah bin Uthatha for he was his relative, said, By Allah, I will never provide Mistah with anything because of what he said about Aisha. But Allah later revealed: -- \"And let not those who are good and wealthy among you swear not to help their kinsmen, those in need and those who left their homes in Allahs Cause. Let them forgive and overlook. Do you not wish that Allah should forgive you? Verily! Allah is Oft-forgiving, Most Merciful.\" (24.22) After that Abu Bakr said, Yes ! By Allah! I like that Allah should forgive me, and resumed helping Mistah whom he used to help before. Allahs Apostle also asked Zainab bint Jahsh (i.e. the Prophets wife about me saying, What do you know and what did you see? She replied, O Allahs Apostle! I refrain to claim hearing or seeing what I have not heard or seen. By Allah, I know nothing except goodness about Aisha.\" Aisha further added \"Zainab was competing with me (in her beauty and the Prophets love), yet Allah protected her (from being malicious), for she had piety.\"<D>(And if ye wish to exchange one wife for another) He says: If you wish to marry a woman and divorce one you are already married to, or marry a woman in addition to the one you are already married to (and ye have given unto one of them a sum of money (however great)) a dowry, (take nothing from it) from the dowry. (Would ye take it) the dowry (by the way of calumny) as an unlawful possession (and open wrong?) a clear transgression.<D>(And if ye fear) if you know (a breech between them twain (the man and wife)) a dispute between the man and woman and you cannot establish who is at fault, (appoint an arbiter from his folk) from the mans folk to the man so that he can hear what he has to say and therefore establish whether he is in the right or wrong (and an arbiter from her folk) from the womans folk to the woman in order to hear what she has to say and therefore establish whether she is in the right or wrong. (If they) the arbiters (desire amendment) between the man and the woman, (Allah will make them of one mind) i.e. the arbiters, the man and thewoman. (Lo! Allah is ever Knower) of the agreement and disagreement of the arbiters, (Aware) of the doingof the woman and the man. The verses from Allahs saying: (Men are in charge of women, because Allah hath made the one of them to excel the other) to His saying: (If they desire amendment Allah will make them of one mind. Lo! Allah is ever Knower, Aware) were revealed about the daughter of Muhammad Ibn Salamah. Her husband, Asad Ibn al-Rabi had slapped her because she refused to sleep with him. Consequently, she went to the Prophet (pbuh) to seek retaliation against her husband, but Allah prohibited her from doing so.<D>(But if they separate) i.e. the man and the woman through divorce, (Allah will compensate each) the man and the woman (out of His abundance) from His provision: the man will be compensated with another wife and the woman with another husband. (Allah is ever All-Embracing) in relation to them as regards marriage,(All-Knowing) of that which He prescribed for them of justice. Asad Ibn al-Rabi had another young wife whom he favoured, and Allah forbade him from doing so and commanded that the young and the old wives were treated equally.", "Generated_Answer": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out what the right thing to do is in this situation. A person sees someone they know, a young woman, doing something haram with a boy right in front of her. Should she tell the girl's parents? Or should she keep quiet because she was the only one who saw it?\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"haram\" means. Haram refers to actions that are forbidden under Islamic law. So, whatever the young woman is doing is considered sinful in Islam. The person who saw this is probably feeling conflicted about whether to intervene or not.\n\nI guess the first thing to consider is the well-being of the young woman. If she's doing something haram, maybe she's unaware of the seriousness of her actions or the consequences. But then again, she might know and is choosing to do it anyway. The person who saw her might feel a responsibility to help her, either by talking to her directly or by involving her parents.\n\nBut then, there's the issue of privacy. If the person was the only one who saw, maybe the young woman wouldn't want others to know. There could be fear of gossip or embarrassment. So, the person might be worried about betraying the young woman's trust if she tells someone else.\n\nI also need to think about the potential consequences of telling the parents. If the parents find out, they might react harshly, which could affect the young woman's life negatively. On the other hand, not telling them could mean that the behavior continues, possibly leading to more serious issues down the line.\n\nThere's also the Islamic principle of \"amr bil ma'ruf wa nahy anil munkar,\" which means enjoining good and forbidding evil. This could be a religious duty to intervene. But how exactly to do that is the question. Should it be done privately first, or is it necessary to involve others like parents or authorities?\n\nMaybe the person should approach the young woman privately first, expressing concern and advising her. This way, it's handled discreetly without involving others unless necessary. If talking to her doesn't work, then perhaps involving a trusted adult or authority figure would be the next step.\n\nBut I'm not sure if approaching her directly is the best move. Maybe she would get defensive or upset. It could also damage their relationship. So, the person might be hesitant to confront her alone.\n\nAnother angle is considering the boy involved. If he's also someone known, maybe he should be addressed as well"}

Now I'm worried that maybe they didn't wash them properly and just dry cleaned them instead. Hmm, why would I think that? Maybe because I've heard that sometimes laundry services might take shortcuts or misunderstand instructions. Let me think through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to consider what I actually told them. Did I clearly say \"wash and press\"? Or was it possible that I said something else that could be misheard? Maybe if I was in a hurry or not clear, they might have thought I wanted dry cleaning. But I'm pretty sure I specified washing. \n\nNext, how can I tell if they washed the clothes or dry cleaned them? Well, if they were washed, they would probably feel softer and cleaner. Dry cleaning might leave a chemical smell. Also, some fabrics can't be washed and need dry cleaning, but I think the clothes I gave them are washable. \n\nI should also think about the turnaround time. If they dry cleaned the clothes, it might take longer, but if they just washed them, maybe I got them back quickly. But wait, the time alone isn't a sure sign because it can vary based on their workload.\n\nMaybe I should check the tags on the clothes. Sometimes there are care labels that say whether they should be dry cleaned or machine washed. If the tags say dry clean only, then maybe I was the one who made a mistake. But if they say machine washable, then the laundry should have washed them.\n\nI could also smell the clothes. Dry cleaning usually leaves a distinct chemical odor, while washed clothes might smell like detergent. If I don't smell any chemicals, that's a good sign they were washed.\n\nAnother idea is to look at the texture. Washed clothes might be softer, while dry cleaned ones might feel stiffer, especially if they were pressed without washing. Also, if there were any stains, washing would likely remove them, whereas dry cleaning might not if the stains are water-based.\n\nI should also consider the cost. Dry cleaning is usually more expensive than regular washing. If I was charged more, that might indicate they dry cleaned them. But if the price was standard for washing, then probably they just washed them.\n\nWait, but I didn't check the bill yet. Maybe I should look at the receipt to see what services were charged. If it says dry cleaning, then I know. But if it's just wash and press"}
{"Question": "Synthetic Alcohol is not najis ? --T--", "Answer": "In the Name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful, and all blessings and peace upon our master Muhammad, his Folk, Companions and those who follow their noble way,Assalamu alaikum,According to the Indian Hanafi scholars, the fatwa in our times is that synthetic alcohols (and all alcohol not considered khamr) is tahir, and permitted to use and consume AS LONG AS:(a) it is not used as an intoxicant;(b) it is not used as intoxicants as used (i.e. for alcoholic consumption, even a little);(c) it is not used in an amount that intoxicates;(d) it is not used in vain (lahw).This was Mufti Mahmoud Ashraf Usmanis explanation, and it is supported by many fatwas in the great Indian Hanafi fatwa references of the 20th Century. This is the position of Imam Abu Hanifa himself. Later scholars said that the fatwa was on the position of Imam Muhammad ibn al-Hasan al-Shaybani, Abu Hanifas student, that all alcohol is najis and haram, even in small quantities, because of widespread fitna. In our times, because of the widespread use of alcohol in all sorts of things, it has become very difficult to avoid. This is why great Hanafis of our times gave the abovementioned fatwa.Wassalam,Faraz Rabbani", "Document": "Narrated `Aisha:When the last verses of Surat-al-Baqara were revealed, the Prophet went out (of his house to the Mosque) and said, \"The trade of alcohol has become illegal.\"<D>Narrated Jabir bin `Abdullah:\"Some people drank alcohol in the morning of the day (of the battle) of Uhud and were martyred (on the same day).\" Sufyan was asked, \"(Were they martyred) in the last part of the day?)\" He replied, \"Such information does not occur in the narration.\"<D>Narrated Aisha:When the last Verses of Surat al- Baqara were revealed, the Prophet recited them in the mosque and proclaimed the trade of alcohol as illegal.", "Generated_Answer": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether synthetic alcohol is considered najis or not. First, I need to understand what najis means. From what I know, najis is an Islamic term that refers to something impure or unclean. In Islamic jurisprudence, substances that are najis cannot be used in acts of worship, like prayer, because they would invalidate the ritual.\n\nNow, the question is about synthetic alcohol. I know that regular alcohol, like the kind found in alcoholic beverages, is derived from fermentation, usually from plants like grapes or barley. This kind of alcohol is definitely considered najis because it's intoxicating and comes from a process that involves impure substances. But synthetic alcohol is different—it's man-made, created in a lab without the fermentation process.\n\nSo, I need to think about how Islamic scholars view synthetic substances. If something is man-made, does that change its status? I remember that in Islamic law, the source and the process of creation matter. If synthetic alcohol is made from pure, permissible substances, then maybe it's not najis. But I'm not entirely sure. \n\nI should also consider the purpose of synthetic alcohol. Is it used for the same purposes as regular alcohol? If it's not intended for consumption as a beverage, especially not for intoxication, maybe it's treated differently. But I'm not certain. I think some scholars might argue that any form of alcohol, regardless of its source, is najis because it's still alcohol, which is a substance that can intoxicate. Others might differentiate between natural and synthetic sources.\n\nAnother angle is to look at the chemical composition. If synthetic alcohol has the same chemical properties as regular alcohol, maybe it's viewed the same way. But if it's a different compound that just happens to be called alcohol, perhaps it's permissible. I'm not a chemist, so I'm not entirely sure about the differences in chemical structure between synthetic and natural alcohol.\n\nI also need to think about contemporary fatwas or rulings from Islamic scholars on this topic. Since synthetic alcohol is a more modern development, there might be specific rulings addressing it. I should check if any major Islamic authorities have spoken about this. If they consider synthetic alcohol najis, then that settles it, but if they don't, then maybe it's permissible.\n\nI'm also wondering about the process of how synthetic alcohol is made. If it's synthesized from non-impure sources, like petroleum derivatives, then perhaps it's considered pure. But if any"}

He's feeling hypocritical and unsure if his actions are accepted by Allah. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I know that in Islam, intentions are really important. The Prophet (peace be upon him) said that actions are judged by their intentions. So if T is feeling like his intentions aren't pure, that's a valid concern. But maybe he's being too hard on himself.\n\nHe mentions feeling like he doesn't want people to recognize or praise him, but deep inside, he feels something else. I think he's worried that he might be seeking praise or recognition, which could taint his intentions. But the fact that he's reflecting on this shows he's aware and wants to correct it, which is a good sign.\n\nI remember reading that even if someone starts with a good intention but then gets distracted by the desire for praise, they can still correct their intention. It's about continually checking and purifying your motives. So maybe T's deeds can still be accepted if he keeps making the effort to align his intentions with pleasing Allah.\n\nNow, how can he cure this feeling of hypocrisy? I think regular self-reflection is key. Maybe he should take time each day to assess his intentions before doing any deed. Also, seeking knowledge about the correct intentions and the signs of sincerity could help him understand what's acceptable.\n\nAnother point is the concept of ihsan, which is to worship Allah as if you see Him. If T can cultivate that mindset, it might help him focus more on Allah and less on what others think.\n\nHe should also remember that it's okay to have moments of weakness. The important thing is to keep striving and not give up. Consistent effort and seeking forgiveness when he feels he's fallen short can strengthen his relationship with Allah.\n\nMaybe encouraging him to perform more deeds in secret could help reduce the desire for recognition. Private acts of worship can make his intentions more pure because there's no one to impress except Allah.\n\nI should also remind him that Allah is Merciful and knows the heart. If T is sincere in his desire to please Allah, even with some doubts, his deeds are likely accepted. It's the continuous effort and sincerity that matter, not perfection.\n\nIn summary, T needs reassurance that his deeds can be accepted, and he should work on his intentions through reflection, seeking knowledge, and consistent practice.

I didn't see any others. The question is whether these small specks are considered completely overlooked, meaning they don't nullify my wudu (ablution) or make my prayer invalid.\n\nI remember that in Islamic teachings, small amounts of impurity that are unavoidable or difficult to remove might be overlooked. But I'm not sure about the specifics. I think the principle is that if the impurity is so small that it's considered insignificant, it might be excused. But I also recall that intention and effort to clean properly are important. So maybe if I tried my best to avoid splashback and only a tiny amount got on me, it might be overlooked.

After I finished, some water splashed back. The question is whether that splashed water is considered najis (impure).\n\nNajis refers to substances that are impure and can invalidate wudu. Urine is definitely najis, but what about water that splashes back after washing? If the water itself is pure but comes into contact with a najis area, does it become impure? Or is it still considered clean because it's just water?\n\nI think that if the water is clean and doesn't have any impurities in it, splashing back wouldn't make it najis. But if it's mixed with urine or another impurity, then it could be. But in this case, it's just water from the tap, so maybe it's still pure. However, I'm not entirely sure about the ruling on this.\n\nI should probably look up some references or ask someone more knowledgeable, but since I'm trying to figure it out myself, I'll think about what I know. For the first part, the small specks might be overlooked if the effort was made to avoid them. For the second part, the water splashing back is likely still pure unless it's mixed with something impure.\n\nI also recall that in some cases, if water is used for washing and it's"}

You should try and avoid treating the genital and breast areas of a woman.

Again, this is intimate care, and I'm not sure if it's allowed for a male to do this for female patients, even if they're elderly. But maybe the age makes a difference? I'm not sure.\n\nI also heard that some institutions separate male and female staff, but during training, I might not have a choice and could end up with female patients. Is it okay to do this during training only, or should I avoid it entirely?\n\nI should probably look into Islamic rulings on medical professionals and physical contact. Maybe there are exceptions for healthcare workers. I remember something about necessity making things allowed, like in emergencies or for medical treatment. So, if my job is essential and I'm providing necessary care, maybe it's permissible.\n\nBut I'm also thinking about the intention behind the actions. If my intention is purely to help and do my job without any improper motives, that might make a difference. But I'm still not entirely sure.\n\nI also wonder if there are any guidelines from Islamic scholars on this. Maybe they've addressed similar situations. I should check if there are any fatwas or rulings about male healthcare workers dealing with female patients in these situations.\n\nAnother angle is the concept of hijab and modesty. Even if I'm just doing my job, how do I maintain modesty? Maybe by being professional, not lingering, and ensuring I'm properly gloved or using barriers if possible.\n\nBut in the case of ECG, the electrodes need direct skin contact, so gloves might not be an option.

Narrated Sa`id: While we were at the house of Ibn `Abbas, Ibn `Abbas said, \"Ask me (any question)\" I said, \"O Abu `Abbas! May Allah let me be sacrificed for you ! There is a man at Kufa who is a storyteller called Nauf; who claims that he (Al-Khadirs companion) is not Moses of Bani Israel.\" As for `Amr, he said to me, \"Ibn `Abbas said, \"(Nauf) the enemy of Allah told a lie.\" But Ya`la said to me, \"Ibn `Abbas said, Ubai bin Ka`b said, Allahs Apostle said, Once Moses, Allahs Apostle, preached to the people till their eyes shed tears and their hearts became tender, whereupon he finished his sermon. Then a man came to Moses and asked, O Allahs Apostle! Is there anyone on the earth who is more learned than you? Moses replied, No. So Allah admonished him (Moses), for he did not ascribe all knowledge to Allah. It was said, (on behalf of Allah), Yes, (there is a slave of ours who knows more than you ). Moses said, O my Lord! Where is he? Allah said, At the junction of the two seas. Moses said, O my Lord ! Tell I me of a sign whereby I will recognize the place. \" `Amr said to me, Allah said, \"That place will be where the fish will leave you.\" Ya`la said to me, \"Allah said (to Moses), Take a dead fish (and your goal will be) the place where it will become alive. \" So Moses took a fish and put it in a basket and said to his boy-servant \"I dont want to trouble you, except that you should inform me as soon as this fish leaves you.\" He said (to Moses).\" You have not demanded too much.\" And that is as mentioned by Allah: And (remember) when Moses said to his attendant ....  (18.60) Yusha` bin Noon. (Sa`id did not state that). The Prophet said, \"While the attendant was in the shade of the rock at a wet place, the fish slipped out (alive) while Moses was sleeping. His attend an said (to himself), \"I will not wake him, but when he woke up, he forgot to tell him The fish slipped out and entered the sea. Allah stopped the flow of the sea. where the fish was, so that its trace looked as if it was made on a rock. `Amr forming a hole with his two thumbs an index fingers, said to me, \"Like this, as in its trace was made on a rock.\" Moses said \"We have suffered much fatigue on this journey of ours.\" (This was not narrated by Sa`id). Then they returned back and found Al-Khadir. `Uthman bin Abi Sulaiman said to me, (they found him) on a green carpet in the middle of the sea. Al-Khadir was covered with his garment with one end under his feet and the other end under his head. When Moses greeted, he uncovered his face and said astonishingly, Is there such a greeting in my land? Who are you? Moses said, I am Moses. Al- Khadir said, Are you the Moses of Bani Israel? Moses said, Yes. Al-Khadir said, \"What do you want? Moses said,  I came to you so that you may teach me of the truth which you were taught. Al- Khadir said, Is it not sufficient for you that the Torah is in your hands and the Divine Inspiration comes to you, O Moses? Verily, I have a knowledge that you ought not learn, and you have a knowledge which I ought not learn. At that time a bird took with its beak (some water) from the sea: Al-Khadir then said, By Allah, my knowledge and your knowledge besides Allahs Knowledge is like what this bird has taken with its beak from the sea. Until, when they went on board the boat (18.71). They found a small boat which used to carry the people from this sea-side to the other sea-side. The crew recognized Al-Khadir and said, The pious slave of Allah. (We said to Sa`id \"Was that Khadir?\" He said, \"Yes.\") The boat men said, We will not get him on board with fare. Al-Khadir scuttled the boat and then plugged the hole with a piece o wood. Moses said, Have you scuttle it in order to drown these people surely, you have done a dreadful thing. (18.71) (Mujahid said. \"Moses said so protestingly.\") Al-Khadir said, didnt I say that you can have no patience with me? (18.72) The first inquiry of Moses was done because of forget fullness, the second caused him to be bound with a stipulation, and the third was done he intentionally. Moses said, Call me not to account for what I forgot and be not hard upon me for my affair (with you). (18.73) (Then) they found a boy and Al-Khadir killed him. Ya`la- said: Sa`id said They found boys playing and Al-Khadir got hold of a handsome infidel boy laid him down and then slew him with knife. Moses said, Have you killed a innocent soul who has killed nobody (18.74) Then they proceeded and found a wall which was on the point of falling down, and Al-Khadir set it up straight Sa`id moved his hand thus and said Al-Khadir raised his hand and the wall became straight. Ya`la said, I think Sa`id said, Al-Khadir touched the wall with his hand and it became straight (Moses said to Al-Khadir), If you had wished, you could have taken wages for it. Sa`id said, Wages that we might had eaten. And there was a king in furor (ahead) of them\" (18.79) And there was in front of them. Ibn `Abbas recited: In front of them (was) a king. It is said on the authority of somebody other than Sa`id that the king was Hudad bin Budad. They say that the boy was called Haisur. A king who seized every ship by force. (18.79) So I wished that if that boat passed by him, he would leave it because of its defect and when they have passed they would repair it and get benefit from it. Some people said that they closed that hole with a bottle, and some said with tar. His parents were believers, and he (the boy) was a non-believer and we(Khadir) feared lest he would oppress them by obstinate rebellion and disbelief. (18.80) (i.e. that their love for him would urge them to follow him in his religion, so we (Khadir) desired that their Lord should change him for them for one better in righteousness and near to mercy (18:81). This was in reply to Moses saying: Have you killed an innocent soul.? (18.74). Near to mercy\" means they will be more merciful to him than they were to the former whom Khadir had killed.

Hmm, I need to figure out how to respond to this. \n\nFirst off, I know that miscarriages can be really traumatic, both physically and emotionally. The person is probably feeling sad and anxious about trying again. They're looking for some form of comfort and assurance, maybe something spiritual to help them through this tough time. \n\nI remember that in Islam, there are specific prayers and supplications, called wazifas, that people use for various needs, including health and fertility. So, the user is likely seeking a spiritual solution to help them conceive and carry a healthy baby. \n\nI should think about the appropriate wazifas that are recommended for this situation. The most common ones I can recall involve reciting specific verses from the Quran or saying certain prayers that ask for protection and blessings. For example, Ayatul Kursi is often recommended for protection, and there are specific surahs like Surah Al-Furqan and Surah Al-Imran that have verses related to children and health.\n\nI also need to consider the emotional aspect. It's important to reassure the person that their feelings are valid and that it's okay to seek comfort. Encouraging them to stay positive and have faith might be helpful. Additionally, suggesting they consult a healthcare provider is crucial because while spiritual practices can provide comfort, medical advice is necessary to ensure everything is okay physically.\n\nSo, putting it all together, I should outline some recommended wazifas, explain how to perform them, and emphasize the importance of medical consultation. I should also include some general advice on maintaining a healthy lifestyle and keeping a positive outlook. \n\nWait, I should make sure the information is accurate. Maybe I should double-check the specific verses and their sources. Also, I need to present the information in a compassionate and supportive way, avoiding any judgment or overly technical language. \n\nI think including a step-by-step guide on how to perform the wazifas would be helpful. Maybe starting with the intention, then the specific prayers, and the number of times they should be recited. Also, mentioning that consistency is key could be important.\n\nI should also consider that the person might be feeling isolated or alone, so offering words of encouragement and reminding them that they're not alone in this journey could provide some comfort.\n\nIn summary, my response"}

I'm not entirely sure what those terms mean, so maybe I should start by understanding them. From what I remember, in Islamic jurisprudence, Makrooh means something that is disliked but not prohibited. But I think there are two types: Tanzihi and Tahrimi. I think Tanzihi is when something is disliked but still considered recommended to avoid, while Tahrimi is more severe, maybe even approaching prohibition, though still not Haram. I'm not 100% sure, so I might need to look that up.\n\nNext, the question is about removing white or grey hair from the beard. I know that in Islam, there are certain guidelines about grooming, especially for men. The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) is known to have had white hair, and I think there are Hadiths about dyeing the hair. Maybe I should recall those. I remember something about the Prophet recommending to change grey hair because it's a sign of aging, but I'm not sure if he specifically addressed removing the hair or just dyeing it.\n\nWait, actually, I think the Prophet advised against plucking or removing grey hairs. Let me try to remember the Hadith. I think it's something like, \"Do not pluck the grey hairs, because they are the light of the believer.\" Or maybe it was about the wisdom and dignity that comes with age. So, if that's the case, then removing them would be discouraged.\n\nNow, is it Makrooh Tanzihi or Tahrimi? I think in Hanafi jurisprudence, things that are against the Sunnah but not explicitly forbidden are considered Makrooh Tanzihi. Since the Hadith advises against removing grey hairs, it's a Sunnah, so going against it would be Makrooh Tanzihi. But I'm not certain if other schools of thought might have a different ruling.\n\nAs for whether the same rule applies to the beard and the hair on the head, I think they might be treated similarly. The beard is considered a part of the body that has specific rulings, like not trimming it below a fistful. But for the hair on the head, the rules are a bit different. However, regarding dyeing or removing grey hair, the same principle might apply because the Prophet's advice was general.\n\nI'm also trying"}

I'm putting medication on them twice a day as prescribed. Now, the Muslim doctors have told me not to wet my feet because it might slow down the healing process. They also mentioned that I shouldn't get my feet wet during wudu. \n\nHmm, wudu is the Islamic procedure for washing parts of the body before prayer. Normally, you wash your face, arms, head, and feet. But if I try to wash just the bottom of my feet, when I put my socks on, the water from the bottom might seep to the top. That's a problem because the doctors said keeping the top part dry is important for healing. \n\nThe disease could take months or even years to go away, so I'm worried about how long I'll have to deal with this. The question is, is it okay to leave my feet unwashed during wudu for such a long time? I know that in Islam, there are rules about wudu, and if you can't wash a part, you can just wipe over it, but I'm not sure about the specifics when it comes to feet.\n\nI think I remember something about Tayammum, which is using dust when water is not available. Maybe that's an option if washing is harmful. But I'm not entirely clear on how that works, especially for someone who isn't traveling or sick. \n\nAlso, I'm not sure if there's a time limit on how long you can perform wudu differently. If the skin disease is chronic, does that mean I can keep using Tayammum indefinitely? Or is there another solution? I should probably look up the exact rulings on this, maybe check some reliable Islamic sources or ask a scholar. \n\nIn the meantime, I could try being extra careful when washing the bottom of my feet and see if I can somehow prevent water from reaching the top. Maybe using a barrier or just a small amount of water. But I'm not sure if that's practical or effective. \n\nI also wonder if there are any exceptions or specific conditions that allow for not washing the feet at all during wudu. Maybe if it's medically necessary, like in my case, there's a dispensation. I think Islam does allow for exceptions when there's a valid reason, especially health-related. \n\nSo, to sum up, I need to figure out if it's permissible to not wash my feet during wudu for an extended period due to a medical condition"}

Where are you going, leaving us in this valley where there is no person whose company we may enjoy, nor is there anything (to enjoy)?\" She repeated that to him many times, but he did not look back at her Then she asked him, \"Has Allah ordered you to do so?\" He said, \"Yes.\" She said, \"Then He will not neglect us,\" and returned while Abraham proceeded onwards, and on reaching the Thaniya where they could not see him, he faced the Ka`ba, and raising both hands, invoked Allah saying the following prayers: O our Lord! I have made some of my offspring dwell in a valley without cultivation, by Your Sacred House (Ka`ba at Mecca) in order, O our Lord, that they may offer prayer perfectly. So fill some hearts among men with love towards them, and (O Allah) provide them with fruits, so that they may give thanks. (14.37) Ishmaels mother went on suckling Ishmael and drinking from the water (she had). When the water in the water-skin had all been used up, she became thirsty and her child also became thirsty. She started looking at him (i.e. Ishmael) tossing in agony; She left him, for she could not endure looking at him, and found that the mountain of Safa was the nearest mountain to her on that land. She stood on it and started looking at the valley keenly so that she might see somebody, but she could not see anybody. Then she descended from Safa and when she reached the valley, she tucked up her robe and ran in the valley like a person in distress and trouble, till she crossed the valley and reached the Marwa mountain where she stood and started looking, expecting to see somebody, but she could not see anybody. She repeated that (running between Safa and Marwa) seven times.\" The Prophet said, \"This is the source of the tradition of the walking of people between them (i.e. Safa and Marwa). When she reached the Marwa (for the last time) she heard a voice and she asked herself to be quiet and listened attentively. She heard the voice again and said, O, (whoever you may be)! You have made me hear your voice; have you got something to help me?\" And behold! She saw an angel at the place of Zamzam, digging the earth with his heel (or his wing), till water flowed from that place. She started to make something like a basin around it, using her hand in this way, and started filling her water-skin with water with her hands, and the water was flowing out after she had scooped some of it.\" The Prophet added, \"May Allah bestow Mercy on Ishmaels mother! Had she let the Zamzam (flow without trying to control it) (or had she not scooped from that water) (to fill her water-skin), Zamzam would have been a stream flowing on the surface of the earth.\" The Prophet further added, \"Then she drank (water) and suckled her child. The angel said to her, Dont be afraid of being neglected, for this is the House of Allah which will be built by this boy and his father, and Allah never neglects His people. The House (i.e. Ka`ba) at that time was on a high place resembling a hillock, and when torrents came, they flowed to its right and left. She lived in that way till some people from the tribe of Jurhum or a family from Jurhum passed by her and her child, as they (i.e. the Jurhum people) were coming through the way of Kada. They landed in the lower part of Mecca where they saw a bird that had the habit of flying around water and not leaving it. They said, This bird must be flying around water, though we know that there is no water in this valley. They sent one or two messengers who discovered the source of water, and returned to inform them of the water. So, they all came (towards the water).\" The Prophet added, \"Ishmaels mother was sitting near the water. They asked her, Do you allow us to stay with you?\" She replied, Yes, but you will have no right to possess the water. They agreed to that.\" The Prophet further said, \"Ishmaels mother was pleased with the whole situation as she used to love to enjoy the company of the people. So, they settled there, and later on they sent for their families who came and settled with them so that some families became permanent residents there. The child (i.e. Ishmael) grew up and learnt Arabic from them and (his virtues) caused them to love and admire him as he grew up, and when he reached the age of puberty they made him marry a woman from amongst them. After Ishmaels mother had died, Abraham came after Ishmaels marriage in order to see his family that he had left before, but he did not find Ishmael there. When he asked Ishmaels wife about him, she replied, He has gone in search of our livelihood. Then he asked her about their way of living and their condition, and she replied, We are living in misery; we are living in hardship and destitution, complaining to him. He said, When your husband returns, convey my salutation to him and tell him to change the threshold of the gate (of his house). When Ishmael came, he seemed to have felt something unusual, so he asked his wife, Has anyone visited you? She replied, Yes, an old man of so-and-so description came and asked me about you and I informed him, and he asked about our state of living, and I told him that we were living in a hardship and poverty. On that Ishmael said, Did he advise you anything? She replied, Yes, he told me to convey his salutation to you and to tell you to change the threshold of your gate. Ishmael said, It was my father, and he has ordered me to divorce you. Go back to your family. So, Ishmael divorced her and married another woman from amongst them (i.e. Jurhum). Then Abraham stayed away from them for a period as long as Allah wished and called on them again but did not find Ishmael. So he came to Ishmaels wife and asked her about Ishmael. She said, He has gone in search of our livelihood. Abraham asked her, How are you getting on? asking her about their sustenance and living. She replied, We are prosperous and well-off (i.e. we have everything in abundance). Then she thanked Allah Abraham said, What kind of food do you eat? She said. Meat. He said, What do you drink? She said, Water.\" He said, \"O Allah! Bless their meat and water.\" The Prophet added, \"At that time they did not have grain, and if they had grain, he would have also invoked Allah to bless it.\" The Prophet added, \"If somebody has only these two things as his sustenance, his health and disposition will be badly affected, unless he lives in Mecca.\" The Prophet added,\" Then Abraham said Ishmaels wife, \"When your husband comes, give my regards to him and tell him that he should keep firm the threshold of his gate. When Ishmael came back, he asked his wife, Did anyone call on you? She replied, Yes, a good-looking old man came to me, so she praised him and added. He asked about you, and I informed him, and he asked about our livelihood and I told him that we were in a good condition. Ishmael asked her, Did he give you any piece of advice? She said, Yes, he told me to give his regards to you and ordered that you should keep firm the threshold of your gate. On that Ishmael said, It was my father, and you are the threshold (of the gate). He has ordered me to keep you with me. Then Abraham stayed away from them for a period as long as Allah wished, and called on them afterwards. He saw Ishmael under a tree near Zamzam, sharpening his arrows. When he saw Abraham, he rose up to welcome him (and they greeted each other as a father does with his son or a son does with his father). Abraham said, O Ishmael! Allah has given me an order. Ishmael said, Do what your Lord has ordered you to do. Abraham asked, Will you help me? Ishmael said, I will help you. Abraham said, Allah has ordered me to build a house here, pointing to a hillock higher than the land surrounding it.\" The Prophet added, \"Then they raised the foundations of the House (i.e. the Ka`ba). Ishmael brought the stones and Abraham was building, and when the walls became high, Ishmael brought this stone and put it for Abraham who stood over it and carried on building, while Ishmael was handing him the stones, and both of them were saying, O our Lord! Accept (this service) from us, Verily, You are the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing. The Prophet added, \"Then both of them went on building and going round the Ka`ba saying: O our Lord ! Accept (this service) from us, Verily, You are the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing.\" (2.127)<D>Narrated Qaylah bint Makhramah:Abdullah ibn Hasan al-Anbari said: My grandmothers, Safiyyah and Duhaybah, narrated to me, that hey were the daughters of Ulaybah and were nourished by Qaylah, daughter of Makhramah.

He took the oath of allegiance of Islam for himself and for his people. He then said: Messenger of Allah (), write a document for us, giving us the land lying between us and Banu Tamim at ad-Dahna to the effect that not one of them will cross it in our direction except a traveller or a passer-by. He said: Write down ad-Dahna for them, boy. When I saw that he passed orders to give it to him, I became anxious, for it was my native land and my home. I said: Messenger of Allah, he did not ask you for a true border when he asked you. This land of Dahna is a place where the camels have their home, and it is a pasture for the sheep. The women of Banu Tamim and their children are beyond it. He said: Stop, boy! A poor woman spoke the truth: a Muslim is a brother of a Muslim.

I'm not entirely sure about all the implications here, so I need to break this down.\n\nFirst, I should understand what Zam Zam water is. From what I know, Zam Zam is a sacred well in Mecca, Saudi Arabia, and the water is considered holy in Islam. Muslims often drink it for blessings and spiritual reasons. So, giving it to someone else, especially from another faith, might have some considerations.\n\nThe person in question is Hindu. I need to think about how Hindus view such things. I know that Hindus have their own set of sacred waters, like the Ganges River, so they might have respect for holy water in general. But would they accept Zam Zam water? I'm not sure if there are any religious prohibitions or if it's just a matter of personal choice.\n\nAlso, the person is suffering from hiccups for many years. That's a medical issue. While Zam Zam water is considered blessed, it's not a medical treatment. So, maybe the user is looking for both spiritual and physical relief. I should consider if there's any medical advice here. Maybe they should also consult a doctor, but that's separate from the religious aspect.\n\nFrom an Islamic perspective, is there any restriction on sharing Zam Zam water with non-Muslims? I don't recall any specific prohibition, but it's more about the intention and respect. If the Hindu person is open to receiving it and respects its significance, then maybe it's acceptable.\n\nI should also think about cultural sensitivities. Offering something sacred from another religion could be seen as respectful or might be declined. It's important to approach this with respect and ensure that the Hindu individual is comfortable with it.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer should address the spiritual aspects, respect for both faiths, and the medical advice. It's probably permissible as long as it's done with respect and the person is willing to accept it. But I'm not entirely sure if there are any specific rules, so I might need to mention that it's advisable to check with a religious scholar for more detailed guidance.\n</think>\n\nGiving Zam Zam water to a Hindu individual suffering from persistent hiccups can be approached with sensitivity and respect.

Walid b. Samit reported:I and my father set out in search of knowledge to a tribe of the Ansar before their death (i. e. before the Companions of the Holy Prophet left the world) and I was the first to meet Abu Yasar, a Companion of Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) and there was a young man with him who carried the record of letters with him and there was a mantle prepared by the tribe of Maafiri upon him. And his servant too had a Maafiri mantle over him. My father said to him: My uncle, I see the signs of anger or that of agony on your face. He said: Yes, such and such person, the son of so and so, of the tribe of Harami owed me a debt. I went to his family, extended salutations and said: Where is he? They said: He is not here. Then came out to me his son who was at the threshold of his youth. I said to him: Where is your father? He said: No sooner did he hear your sound than he hid himself behind my mothers bedstead. I said to him: Walk out to me, for I know where you are. He came out. I said to him: What prompted you to hide yourself from me? He said: By God, whatever I would say to you would not be a lie. By Allah, I fear that I should tell a lie to you and in case of making promise with you I should break it, as you are the Companion of Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him). The fact is that I was hard up in regard to money. I said: Do you adjure by Allah? He said: I adjure by Allah. I said: Do you adjure by Allah? He said: I adjure by Allah. I said: Do you adjure by Allah? He said: I adjure by Allah. Then he brought his promissory note and he wrote off (the debt) with his hand and said: Make payment when you find yourself solvent enough to pay me back; if you are not, then there is no liability upon you. These two eyes of mine saw, and he (AbuI-Yasar) placed his fingers upon his eyes and these two ears of mine heard and my heart retained, and he pointed towards his heart that Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: He who gives time to one who is financially hard up (in the payment of debt) or writes off his debt, Allah will provide him His shadow. I said to him: My uncle, if you get the cloak of your servant and you give him your two clothes, or take his two clothes of Maafir and give him your cloak, then there would be one dress for you and one for him. He wiped my head and said: O Allah, bless the son of my brother. O, son of my brother, these two very eyes of mine saw and these two ears of mine listened to and this heart of mine retained this, and he pointed towards the heart that Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: Feed them (the servants) and clothe them (the servants) what you wear, and if I give him the goods of the world, it is easy for me than this that he should take my virtues on the Day of Resurrection. We went on till we came to Jabir b. Abdullah in the mosque and he was busy in observing prayer in one cloth which he had joined at its opposite ends. I made my way through the people till I sat between him and the Qibla and I said: May Allah have mercy upon you. Do you observe prayer with one cloth on your body whereas your mantle is lying at your side? He pointed me with his hand towards my breast just like this and he separated his fingers and bent them in the shape of a bow. And (he said): I thought that a fool like you should come to me so that he should see me as I do and he should then also do like it. Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) came to us in this very mosque and he had in his hand the twig of the palm-tree and he saw mucus towards the Qibla of the mosque and he erased it with the help of the twig. He then came to us and said: Who amongst you likes that Allah should turn His face away from him? We were afraid. He then again said: Who amongst you likes that Allah should turn His face away from him? We were afraid. He again said: Who amongst you likes that Allah should turn His face away from him? We said: Allahs Messenger, none of us likes it. And he said: If one amongst you stands for prayer, Allah, the Exalted and Glorious, is before him he should not spit in front of him, or on his right side, but should spit on his left side beneath his left foot and if he is impelled to do so all of a sudden (in spite of himself) he should then spit in his cloth and fold it in some part of it. (and he further said: ) Bring some sweet-smelling thing. A young man who belonged to our tribe stood up, went and brought scent in his palm. Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) took that and applied it to the end of that twig and then touched the place where there had been mucus. Jabir said: This is why you should apply scent to your mosques. It is reported on the same authority: We set out along with Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) on an expedition of Batn Buwat. He (the Holy Prophet) was in search of al-Majdi b. Amr al-Juhani. (We had so meagre equipment) that five. six or seven of us had one camel to ride and so we mounted it turn by turn. Once there wan. the turn of an Ansari to ride upon the camel. He made it kneel down to ride over it (and after having. mounted it), he tried to raise it up but it hesitated. So he said. May there be curse of Allah upon you! Thereupon Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: Who is there to curse his camel? He said: Allahs Messenger, it is I. Thereupon he said: Get down from the camel and let us not have in our company the cursed one. Dont curse your own selves, nor your children. nor your belongings. There is the possibility that your curse may synchronies with the time when Allah is about to confer upon you what you demand and thus your prayer may be readily responded. It is reported on the same authority: We set out on an expedition along with Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) until it was evening, and we had been near a. water reservoir of Arabia. Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: Who would be the person who would go ahead and set right the reservoir and drink water himself and serve us with it? Jabir said: I stood up and said: Allahs Messenger, it is I who am ready to do that. Thereupon Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: Who is the person to accompany Jabir? And then Jabbar b. Sakhr stood up. So we went to that well and poured in that tank a bucket or two of water and plastered it with clay and then began to fill it (with water) until it was filled to the brim. Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) was the first who appeared before us, and he said: Do you (both) permit me to drink water out of it? We said: Yea, Allahs Messenger. He led his camel to drink water and it drank. He then pulled its rein and it stretched its legs and began to urinate. He then took it aside and made it kneel down at another place and then came to the tank and performed ablution. I then got up and performed ablution like the ablution of Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him), and Jabbar b. Sakhr went in order to relieve himself and Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) got up to observe prayer and there was a mantle over me. I tried to invert its ends but it was too short (to cover my body easily). It had its borders. I then inverted it (the mantle) and drew its opposite ends and then tied them at my neck. I then came and stood upon the left side of Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him). He caught hold of me and made me go round behind him, until he made me stand on his right side. Then Jabbar b. Sakhr came. He performed ablution and then came and stood on the left side of Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him). Then Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) caught hold of our hands together, pushed us back and made us stand behind him. Then Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) began to look upon me with darting looks, but I did not perceive that. After that I became aware of it and he pointed with the gesture of his hand that I should wrap my loin-cloth. When Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) had finished the prayer, he said: Jabir! I said: Allahs Messenger, at thy beck and call. He said: When the cloth around you is inadequate, then tie the opposite ends but when it is small, tie it over the lower body. Jabir reported: We set out on an expedition with Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) and the only means of sustenance for every person amongst us was only one date for a day and we used to chew it. And we struck the leaves with the help of our bow and ate them until the sides of our mouths were injured. It so happened one day that a person was overlooked and not given a date. We carried that person and bore witness to the fact that he had not been given that date so he was offered that and he got up and received that. Jabir reported: We set out on an expedition along with Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) until we got down at a spacious valley and Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) went to relieve himself. I followed him with a bucket full of water and Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) looked about and he found no privacy but two trees at the end of the valley and Allahs Messenger (may. peace be upon him) went to one of them and took hold of one of its twigs and said: Be thou under my control by the permission of Allah, and so it came under his control like the camel who has its nosestring in the hand of its rider, and then he came to the second tree and took hold of a twig and said: Be thou under my control with the permission of Allah, and it came under his control, and when he came in the middle of the two trees he joined together the two twigs and said: join with the permission of Allah. Jabir said: I was afraid lest Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) should be aware of my nearness and go still farther. And Muhammad b. Abbad has used the word\" faitabd\" and I began to talk to myself. And as I saw, I suddenly found Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) before me and the two trees were separated and each one of them was standing at its place. I saw Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) standing for a short time, nodding his head towards right and left. Ismail pointed towards the right and left with the help of his head (in order to demonstrate how the Holy Prophet had pointed). Then he (the Holy Prophet) came to me and said: Jabir did you see my place where I was standing? I said: Allahs Messenger, yes. He then said: Then you should go to those two trees and cut a twig from each of them and go to that place with them where I was standing and stand there where I was standing and place a twig on the right and a twig on the left. Jabir said: I set out and took hold of a stone and broke it and sharpened it and then I came to those trees and cut a twig from each one of them. I then came dragging them until I stood at the place where Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) had been standing and placed a twig on the right and a twig on the left. Then I met him and said: Allahs Messenger, I have done that, but (kindly) explain to me the reason for it. Thereupon he said: I passed by two graves the occupants of which had been undergoing torment. I liked to make intercession for them so that the might be relieved of this torment y as long as these twigs remain fresh. Jabir said: We came back to the (camp of the) army and Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: Jabir, call people for per- forming wudu. I cried: Come and perform wudu, come and perform wudu, come and perform wudu. I said: Allahs Messenger, there is not even a drop of water in the army camp, and there. was a person who used to cool the water for Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) in the old water-skin which kept hanging by the twig. He asked me to go to such and such Ansari and ask him to see if there was any water in that skin. I went to him and cast a glance in it but did not find anything but a drop in the mouth of that water-skin and if I were to draw that, the water-skins,. dried part would suck it up. I came to Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) and said: Allahs Messenger, I have not found anything in it but a drop of water in the mouth of the water-skin and now if I were to draw that, it would be absorbed. He said: Go and bring that to me. I brought that to him. He took hold of it -and began to utter something which I could not understand and then pressed it with his hand and gave that to me and said: Jabir, announce for the tub to be brought. So I announced that the tub of the army (be brought). It was brought accordingly and I placed it before him (the Holy Prophet). Thereupon Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) placed his hands in the tub like this: with his fingers stretched out, and then he placed his fingers at the bottom of the tub and said: Jabir, take it (that waters-skin) and pour water over me, by reciting Bismillah, and I poured water and I said: Bismillah, and found water sprouting out between the fingers of Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him). Then that tub gushed forth until it was filled up and the Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: Jabir, make an announcement to the effect: He who needs water should take that. Jabir said: The people came and got water until they were all satiated. I said: Is there anyone left who wants to get it? And Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) then lifted up his hand from that tub and it was still full. Then the people made a complaint to Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) about hunger and he said: May Allah provide you food! We came to the bank of the ocean and the ocean was tossing and it threw out a big animal and we lit fire and cooked it and took it until we had eaten to our hearts content. Jabir said: I and such and such five persons entered Its socket and nobody could see us until we had come out, and we took hold of one of its ribs and twisted it into a sort of arch, then we called the tallest of the persons of the army and the hugest of the camels of the army and it had the big saddle over it, and it could easily pass through it without the rider having need to bend down.<D>(They said: In Allah we put trust.

They mentioned that sometimes the toilet paper moves, making their underwear possibly impure (napaak), and they're worried about whether they need to wash their underwear. Also, they've led prayers as an imam in this state and are concerned about making up for the prayers of the people who followed them.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the Islamic rulings on purity, especially after using the toilet. From what I know, in Islam, maintaining purity (taharah) is crucial for valid prayers. After urinating, it's important to ensure that all droplets are removed to avoid any impurity (najis) remaining. If there's any moisture, it could invalidate the wudu (ablution) and thus the prayer.\n\nThe person is using toilet paper to clean themselves, which is fine, but sometimes the paper moves, causing them to doubt whether they've cleaned properly. This seems like it might be causing waswasa, which is a kind of obsessive doubt that can affect one's religious practices. I remember that Islamic scholars often advise against paying too much attention to waswasa and to trust in one's actions as long as they've done their best.\n\nRegarding the underwear, if they're unsure whether it came into contact with any impurity, they should check. If they see or feel something, they should wash that area. If not, then it's probably clean. So, they don't need to wash the entire underwear unless they're certain it's soiled.\n\nAs for leading prayers as an imam, if they were in a state where their wudu was broken, then the prayer might not be valid. But if they did their best to maintain their wudu, then the followers' prayers should still be valid. However, to be safe, they could repeat the prayers or advise the followers to do so if they're unsure.\n\nI think the key points are to trust in their cleaning process, not give in to waswasa, and if they're unsure, take necessary precautions without overreacting. They should also consult a scholar for personalized advice.\n</think>\n\nThe question revolves around maintaining purity for prayer in Islam, specifically after using the toilet, and the implications of potential impurity on leading prayers as an imam.

When I looked and found a snake there, I got up. Abu Sa’ld said:what is with you? I said : Here is a snake. He said : what do you want ? I said : I shall kill it. He then pointed to a room in his house in front of his room and said : My cousin (son of my uncle) was in this room. He asked his permission to go to his wife on the occasion of the battle of Troops (Ahzab), as he was recently married. The Messenger of Allah (May peace be upon him) gave him permission and ordered him to take his weapon with him. He came to his house and found his wife standing at the door of the house. When he pointed to her with the lance, she said; do not make haste till you see what has brought me out. He entered the house and found an ugly snake there. He pierced in the lance while it was quivering. He said : I do not know which of them died first, the man or the snake. His people then came to the Messenger of Allah (May peace be upon him) and said: supplicate Allah to restore our companion to life for us. He said : Ask forgiveness for your Companion. Then he said : In Medina a group of Jinn have embraced Islam, so when you see one of them, pronounce a waring to it three times and if it appears to you after that, kill it after three days.<D>Narrated Sahl bin Sa`d:A woman presented herself to the Prophet (for marriage). A man said to him, \"O Allahs Apostle! (If you are not in need of her) marry her to me.\" The Prophet said, \"What have you got?\" The man said, \"I have nothing.\" The Prophet said (to him), \"Go and search for something) even if it were an iron ring.\" The man went and returned saying, \"No, I have not found anything, not even an iron ring; but this is my (Izar) waist sheet, and half of it is for her.\" He had no Rida (upper garment). The Prophet said, \"What will she do with your waist sheet? If you wear it, she will have nothing over her; and if she wears it, you will have nothing over you.\" So the man sat down and when he had sat a long time, he got up (to leave). When the Prophet saw him (leaving), he called him back, or the man was called (for him), and he said to the man, \"How much of the Quran do you know (by heart)?\" The man replied I know such Sura and such Sura (by heart),\" naming the Suras The Prophet said, \"I have married her to you for what you know of the Quran .\"<D>Narrated Abu Huraira:Allahs Apostle said, \"Horses may be used for three purposes: For a man they may be a source of reward (in the Hereafter); for another, a means of protection; and for another, a source of sin. The man for whom they are a source of reward, is the one who keeps them for Allahs Cause and ties them with long ropes and lets them graze in a pasture or garden. Whatever those long ropes allow them to eat of that pasture or garden, will be written as good deeds for him and if they break their ropes and run one or two rounds, then all their footsteps and dung will be written as good deeds for him, and if they pass a river and drink from it though he has had no intention of watering them, even then, that will be written as good deeds for him. So such horses are a source of reward for that man. For the man who keeps horses for his livelihood in order not to ask others for help or beg his bread, and at the same time he does not forget Allahs right of what he earns through them and of their backs (that he presents it to be used in Allahs Cause), such horses are a shelter for him (from poverty). For the man who keeps them just out of pride and for showing off, they are a source of sin.\" Then Allahs Apostle was asked about donkeys. He said, \"Allah has not revealed anything to me regarding them except this comprehensive Verse: \"Then anyone who has done good, equal to the weight of an atom (or a small ant) shall see it, and any one who has done evil, equal to the weight of an atom (or a small ant) shall see it.\" (99.7-8)<D>(So Allah seized him) Allah punished him ((and made him) an example for the after (life) and for the former) the punishment that he suffered in the life of the world is drowning and the punishment of the Hereafter will be in the Fire; it is also said that this means: Allah has punished him because of his former and latter pronouncements.

They've been jobless for five years, can't get engaged, and had ear operations that aren't fixed. They're really sad and asking what to do with the papers.\n\nFirst, I should understand the context. Sura Jin is from the Quran, right? It's a chapter, and writing it many times might be a form of dhikr or devotion. But doing it without permission—maybe they think they needed some kind of authorization, like from a scholar or something.\n\nI remember that in Islam, writing Quranic verses is a good deed, but there are rules about handling the Quran. If the papers have Quranic text, they need to be disposed of properly, not just thrown away. Maybe that's part of the issue—improper disposal could be considered disrespectful.\n\nSo, the person might be feeling guilty or worried that their actions have led to their current problems. They might believe that not handling the papers correctly has caused them misfortune. That’s why they’re asking what to do with the papers now.\n\nI should consider advising them on how to properly dispose of the papers. In Islam, you can bury them or burn them respectfully. Also, maybe suggesting they perform some form of expiation or seek forgiveness if they think they mishandled the Quran.\n\nAdditionally, they might need spiritual guidance. They’re feeling stuck in life, so encouraging them to seek help from a trusted imam or scholar could be good. They might need to perform certain prayers or seek duas for their problems.\n\nI should also think about the psychological aspect. Being jobless and facing health issues can be really tough. Maybe suggesting they seek counseling or support groups could help them cope with their sadness and find practical solutions.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the advice should include proper disposal of the papers, seeking forgiveness, consulting a scholar, and addressing their emotional and practical needs.\n</think>\n\nThe individual is facing several challenges, including unemployment, personal issues, and health problems, which they attribute to writing Sura Jin 1000 times without permission.

(For such) for the unbelievers (We have prepared a painful doom) this was revealed about Tumah and his companions who had left Islam.", "Generated_Answer": "<think>\nOkay, so I have this question about Islamic purity laws, specifically dealing with najasah on clothing. Let me try to break it down and figure it out step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that najasah refers to impurities in Islam, like urine, feces, blood, etc. If someone has any of these on their clothes, they need to clean them before prayer because you can't pray with impure clothes. Now, the question is about immersing oneself in a big pool or something similar. I think this refers to making ghusl, which is a full-body wash, usually done after major impurity like menstrual bleeding or sexual activity.\n\nSo, the person is asking: if you have najasah on your clothes and then you do ghusl in a big pool, does that make the clothes pure again, even if you can't see any traces of the impurity anymore? I'm not entirely sure, so I need to think about the rules here.\n\nFrom what I remember, ghusl involves washing the entire body, and if you're immersed in water, like in a pool, it's considered a valid way to perform ghusl. But does that water also purify the clothes you're wearing? Or does each piece of clothing need to be washed separately?\n\nI think the key point is whether the impurity is only on the clothes or if it's on the body as well. If the impurity is just on the clothes and you do ghusl without removing them, maybe the water from ghusl could wash away the impurity. But I'm not certain if the clothes are considered pure just because you washed your body while wearing them.\n\nWait, there's a concept called \"istinjā' bil-māi\" where you wash a part of the body that had impurity. But that's more for specific areas, not the whole body. Also, I recall that for clothes, the impurity needs to be washed out. So just immersing in water without actively washing the spot might not be enough.\n\nAnother angle: if after ghusl, there's no trace of the impurity left on the clothes, does that mean they're pure? I think in Islamic law, if the impurity is removed and there's no trace, the clothing becomes pure. But does immersing in water without physically cleaning the area count as removing the impurity?\n\nMaybe it depends on whether the water was enough to remove the impurity. If"}
{"Question": "Q: Sometimes I am in situations where I am falsely accused or even penalised but in reality, I have not done anything wrong or committed any mistake or error? Is there any advice to help in these situations? ? --T--", "Answer": "If you are able to clarify the issue and in a respectful manner explain your side of the issue, then you should do so. And Allah Taala ( ) knows best", "Document": "Narrated Aisha:(the wife of the Prophet) \"Whenever Allahs Apostle intended to go on a journey, he would draw lots amongst his wives and would take with him the one upon whom the lot fell. During a Ghazwa of his, he drew lots amongst us and the lot fell upon me, and I proceeded with him after Allah had decreed the use of the veil by women. I was carried in a Howdah (on the camel) and dismounted while still in it. When Allahs Apostle was through with his Ghazwa and returned home, and we approached the city of Medina, Allahs Apostle ordered us to proceed at night. When the order of setting off was given, I walked till I was past the army to answer the call of nature. After finishing I returned (to the camp) to depart (with the others) and suddenly realized that my necklace over my chest was missing. So, I returned to look for it and was delayed because of that. The people who used to carry me on the camel, came to my Howdah and put it on the back of the camel, thinking that I was in it, as, at that time, women were light in weight, and thin and lean, and did not use to eat much. So, those people did not feel the difference in the heaviness of the Howdah while lifting it, and they put it over the camel. At that time I was a young lady. They set the camel moving and proceeded on. I found my necklace after the army had gone, and came to their camp to find nobody. So, I went to the place where I used to stay, thinking that they would discover my absence and come back in my search. While in that state, I felt sleepy and slept. Safwan bin Muattal As-Sulami Adh-Dhakwani was behind the army and reached my abode in the morning. When he saw a sleeping person, he came to me, and he used to see me before veiling. So, I got up when I heard him saying, \"Inna lil-lah-wa inn a ilaihi rajiun (We are for Allah, and we will return to Him).\" He made his camel knell down. He got down from his camel, and put his leg on the front legs of the camel and then I rode and sat over it. Safwan set out walking, leading the camel by the rope till we reached the army who had halted to take rest at midday. Then whoever was meant for destruction, fell into destruction, (some people accused me falsely) and the leader of the false accusers was `Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul. After that we returned to Medina, and I became ill for one month while the people were spreading the forged statements of the false accusers. I was feeling during my ailment as if I were not receiving the usual kindness from the Prophet which I used to receive from him when I got sick. But he would come, greet and say, How is that (girl)? I did not know anything of what was going on till I recovered from my ailment and went out with Um Mistah to the Manasi where we used to answer the call of nature, and we used not to go to answer the call of nature except from night to night and that was before we had lavatories near to our houses. And this habit of ours was similar to the habit of the old Arabs in the open country (or away from houses). So. I and Um Mistah bint Ruhm went out walking. Um Mistah stumbled because of her long dress and on that she said, Let Mistah be ruined. I said, You are saying a bad word. Why are you abusing a man who took part in (the battle of) Badr? She said, O Hanata (you there) didnt you hear what they said? Then she told me the rumors of the false accusers. My sickness was aggravated, and when I returned home, Allahs Apostle came to me, and after greeting he said, How is that (girl)? I requested him to allow me to go to my parents. I wanted then to be sure of the news through them I Allahs Apostle allowed me, and I went to my parents and asked my mother, What are the people talking about? She said, O my daughter! Dont worry much about this matter. By Allah, never is there a charming woman loved by her husband who has other wives, but the women would forge false news about her. I said, Glorified be Allah! Are the people really taking of this matter? That night I kept on weeping and could not sleep till morning. In the morning Allahs Apostle called `Ali bin Abu Talib and Usama bin Zaid when he saw the Divine Inspiration delayed, to consul them about divorcing his wife (i.e. `Aisha). Usama bin Zaid said what he knew of the good reputation of his wives and added, O Allahs Apostle! Keep you wife, for, by Allah, we know nothing about her but good. `Ali bin Abu Talib said, O Allahs Apostle! Allah has no imposed restrictions on you, and there are many women other than she, yet you may ask the woman-servant who will tell you the truth. On that Allahs Apostle called Buraira and said, O Burair. Did you ever see anything which roused your suspicions about her? Buraira said, No, by Allah Who has sent you with the Truth, I have never seen in her anything faulty except that she is a girl of immature age, who sometimes sleeps and leaves the dough for the goats to eat. On that day Allahs Apostle ascended the pulpit and requested that somebody support him in punishing `Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul. Allahs Apostle said, Who will support me to punish that person (`Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul) who has hurt me by slandering the reputation of my family? By Allah, I know nothing about my family but good, and they have accused a person about whom I know nothing except good, and he never entered my house except in my company. Sa`d bin Mu`adh got up and said, O Allahs Apostle! by Allah, I will relieve you from him. If that man is from the tribe of the Aus, then we will chop his head off, and if he is from our brothers, the Khazraj, then order us, and we will fulfill your order. On that Sa`d bin Ubada, the chief of the Khazraj and before this incident, he had been a pious man, got up, motivated by his zeal for his tribe and said, By Allah, you have told a lie; you cannot kill him, and you will never be able to kill him. On that Usaid bin Al-Hadir got up and said (to Sa`d bin Ubada), By Allah! you are a liar. By Allah, we will kill him; and you are a hypocrite, defending the hypocrites. On this the two tribes of Aus and Khazraj got excited and were about to fight each other, while Allahs Apostle was standing on the pulpit. He got down and quieted them till they became silent and he kept quiet. On that day I kept on weeping so much so that neither did my tears stop, nor could I sleep. In the morning my parents were with me and I had wept for two nights and a day, till I thought my liver would burst from weeping. While they were sitting with me and I was weeping, an Ansari woman asked my permission to enter, and I allowed her to come in. She sat down and started weeping with me. While we were in this state, Allahs Apostle came and sat down and he had never sat with me since the day they forged the accusation. No revelation regarding my case came to him for a month. He recited Tashah-hud (i.e. None has the right to be worshipped but Allah and Muhammad is His Apostle) and then said, O `Aisha! I have been informed such-and-such about you; if you are innocent, then Allah will soon reveal your innocence, and if you have committed a sin, then repent to Allah and ask Him to forgive you, for when a person confesses his sin and asks Allah for forgiveness, Allah accepts his repentance. When Allahs Apostle finished his speech my tears ceased completely and there remained not even a single drop of it. I requested my father to reply to Allahs Apostle on my behalf. My father said, By Allah, I do not know what to say to Allahs Apostle. I said to my mother, Talk to Allahs Apostle on my behalf. She said, By Allah, I do not know what to say to Allahs Apostle. I was a young girl and did not have much knowledge of the Quran. I said. I know, by Allah, that you have listened to what people are saying and that has been planted in your minds and you have taken it as a truth. Now, if I told you that I am innocent and Allah knows that I am innocent, you would not believe me and if I confessed to you falsely that I am guilty, and Allah knows that I am innocent you would believe me. By Allah, I dont compare my situation with you except to the situation of Josephs father (i.e. Jacob) who said, So (for me) patience is most fitting against that which you assert and it is Allah (Alone) whose help can be sought. Then I turned to the other side of my bed hoping that Allah would prove my innocence. By Allah I never thought that Allah would reveal Divine Inspiration in my case, as I considered myself too inferior to be talked of in the Holy Quran. I had hoped that Allahs Apostle might have a dream in which Allah would prove my innocence. By Allah, Allahs Apostle had not got up and nobody had left the house before the Divine Inspiration came to Allahs Apostle. So, there overtook him the same state which used to overtake him, (when he used to have, on being inspired divinely). He was sweating so much so that the drops of the sweat were dropping like pearls though it was a (cold) wintry day. When that state of Allahs Apostle was over, he was smiling and the first word he said, `Aisha! Thank Allah, for Allah has declared your innocence. My mother told me to go to Allahs Apostle . I replied, By Allah I will not go to him and will not thank but Allah. So Allah revealed: \"Verily! They who spread the slander are a gang among you . . .\" (24.11) When Allah gave the declaration of my Innocence, Abu Bakr, who used to provide for Mistah bin Uthatha for he was his relative, said, By Allah, I will never provide Mistah with anything because of what he said about Aisha. But Allah later revealed: -- \"And let not those who are good and wealthy among you swear not to help their kinsmen, those in need and those who left their homes in Allahs Cause. Let them forgive and overlook. Do you not wish that Allah should forgive you? Verily! Allah is Oft-forgiving, Most Merciful.\" (24.22) After that Abu Bakr said, Yes ! By Allah! I like that Allah should forgive me, and resumed helping Mistah whom he used to help before. Allahs Apostle also asked Zainab bint Jahsh (i.e. the Prophets wife about me saying, What do you know and what did you see? She replied, O Allahs Apostle! I refrain to claim hearing or seeing what I have not heard or seen. By Allah, I know nothing except goodness about Aisha.\" Aisha further added \"Zainab was competing with me (in her beauty and the Prophets love), yet Allah protected her (from being malicious), for she had piety.\"<D>Narrated Aishah:\"What was said about me had been said, and I myself was unaware of it, the Messenger of Allah () got up and addressed the people. He recited the Tashahhud and after praising and expressing gratitude to Allah, as He deserved, he said: To proceed: O people! Give me your opinion regarding those people who made a forged story against my wife. By Allah, I do not know anything bad about her at all. By Allah, they accused her of being with a man about whom I have never known anything bad, and he never entered my house unless I was present there, and whenever I went on a journey, he went with me. Sad bin Muadh [may Allah be pleased with him] got up and said: O Messenger of Allah ()! Allow me to chop their heads off! Then a man from Al-Khazraj, to whom the mother of Hassan bin Thabit was a relative, got up and said (to Sad): You have told a lie! By Allah, if those persons were from Al-Aws, you would not like to chop their heads. It was probable that some evil would take place between Aws and Khazraj in the Masjid while I was unaware of that. In the evening of that day, I went out for some of my needs, and Umm Mistah was accompanying me. On our return, Umm Mistah stumbled and said: Let Mistah be ruined! I said to her, O mother! Why do you abuse your son? On that Umm Mistah became silent for a while, and stumbling again, she said: Let Mistah be ruined! I said to her: O mother! Why do you abuse your son? She stumbled for the third time and said: Let Mistah be ruined! I said to her: O mother! Why do you abuse your son? Upon that she said: By Allah! I do not abuse him except because of you. I asked her: Concerning what of my affairs? So she disclosed the whole story to me. I said: Has this really happened? She replied: Yes, by Allah! I returned to my house, so astonished, that I did not know for what purpose I had gone out. Then I became sick and said to the Messenger of Allah () Send me to my fathers house. So he sent a servant with me, and when I entered the house, I found Umm Ruman downstairs, while Abu Bakr was reciting something upstairs. My mother asked: What has brought you, O daughter? She said: \"I informed her and mentioned the whole story to her, but she did not feel as I did about it. She said: O my daughter! Do not worry much about this matter, for there is never a charming lady loved by her husband who has other wives, but that they feel jealous of her and speak badly of her. But she did not feel the same about it as I did. I asked her: Does my father know about it? She said Yes. I asked: Does the Messenger of Allah () know about it too? She said Yes, the Messenger of Allah () also knows about it. Tears filled my eyes and I wept. Abu Bakr, who was reading upstairs, heard my voice, and came down asking my mother: What is the matter with her? She said: She has heard what has been said about her. On that Abu Bakr wept and said: I beseech you, by Allah, O my daughter, to go back to your home. I went back to my home, and the Messenger of Allah () had come to my house asking my maid-servant about me. The maid-servant said: By Allah! I do not know of any fault or defect in her character except that she sleeps and lets the sheep enter and eat her dough. On that, some of the Prophets Companions spoke harshly to her and said: Tell the truth to the Messenger of Allah (). Finally, they told her of the slander and she said: Subhan Allah! By Allah, I know nothing against her except what a goldsmith knows about a piece of pure gold. Then this news reached the man who was accused, and he said: Subhan Allah! By Allah, I have never uncovered the private parts of any woman. Later, that man was martyred in Allahs Cause. Then the next morning, my parents came to pay me a visit and they stayed with me until the Messenger of Allah () came to me, after he performed the Asr prayer. He came to me and while my parents were sitting around me on my right and my left. The Prophet () said the Tashahhud, praised and glorified Allah and said: Now then, O Aishah! If you have committed a bad deed, or you have wronged (yourself), then repent to Allah, as Allah accepts the repentance from His worshipers. An Ansari woman had come and was sitting near the gate. I said to the Prophet (): Isnt it improper that you speak in such a way in the presence of this lady? The Messenger of Allah () then gave a piece of advice and I turned to my father and requested him to reply to him. My father said: What should I say? Then I turned to my mother and asked her to answer him. She said: What should I say? When my parents did not reply to the Prophet (), I said the Tashahhud, praised and glorified Allah as His due, and I said: Then, by Allah! If I were to tell you that I have not done (this) and Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, is witness that I am telling the truth, that would not be of any use to me on your part, because you (people) have spoken about it and your hearts have absorbed it (as truth); and if I were to tell you that I have done this sin, and Allah knows that I have not done it, then you will say: She has confessed her guilt. By Allah! I do not see a suitable example for me and you except the example of - and I could not remember Yaqbus name - Yusufs father when he said: So patience is most fitting. And it is Allah Whose help can be sought against that which you describe (12:18). She said: \"It was at that time that Revelation came to the Messenger of Allah (), and we remained silent. Then the Revelation was over, and I noticed the signs of happiness on his face while he was wiping (the sweat) from his forehead, and saying: Have the good tidings O Aishah! Allah has revealed your innocence. At that time I was extremely angry. My parents said to me: Get up and go to him. I said: By Allah, I will not do it,and will not thank him nor either of you, but I will thank Allah, Who has revealed my innocence. You have heard (this story) but neither of you have denied it, nor have you changed it (to defend me).\" Aishah used to say: \"But as regards to Zainab bint Jahsh, Allah protected her because of her piety. She did not say anything except good (about me). But her sister, Hamnah was ruined among those who were ruined. Those who used to speak evil about me were Mistah, Hassan bin Thabit, and the hypocrite Abdullah bin Ubayy [bin Salul] and [it is he who] used to spread that news and tempt others to speak of it, and it was he and Hamnah who had the greater share therein. Abu Bakr took an oath that he would never do any favor for Mistah at all. Then Allah, Most High, revealed this Ayah: Let not those among you who are blessed with graces and wealth [until the end of the Ayah] referring to Abu Bakr: to give their kinsmen, the poor, and those who left their homes for Allahs Cause. - meaning Mistah - up to His saying: Do you not love that Allah should forgive you? And Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful (24:22). On that, Abu Bakr said: Yes, by Allah! O our Lord! We wish that You forgive us. So he returned to what he had been doing.\"<D>Abu Dharr reported:I went out one night (and found) the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) walking all alone. There was no man with him.

It's a pretty frustrating situation, and I'm not sure how to handle it. Let me think through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I guess I need to understand why this is happening. Maybe it's a misunderstanding, or maybe someone else made a mistake. I should probably start by staying calm because getting upset might make things worse. If I react emotionally, people might think I'm guilty even if I'm not.\n\nNext, I should gather all the facts. What exactly am I being accused of? What evidence do they have? If I can get all the details, maybe I can find where the mistake is. Documenting everything seems important too. If there are any records, messages, or witnesses, I should collect them to support my case.\n\nThen, I think I need to communicate clearly. Maybe I should talk to the person who accused me or whoever is in charge. I should explain my side without sounding defensive. Using \"I\" statements might help, like saying \"I feel misunderstood\" instead of blaming them. If talking directly doesn't work, maybe I need to take it to a higher authority, like a manager or HR if it's at work.\n\nI also wonder if there are formal processes I should follow. Like, if it's at work, maybe there's a grievance procedure. If it's a legal issue, I might need to consult a lawyer. It's important to know my rights so I don't get taken advantage of.\n\nAnother thing is to focus on the solution rather than the blame. Instead of just saying I'm not guilty, I could suggest ways to clear up the misunderstanding. Maybe proposing an investigation or a way to prevent such mistakes in the future.\n\nI should also take care of my mental health. Being falsely accused can be really stressful, so talking to someone I trust might help. If it's affecting my work or personal life too much, maybe seeing a professional would be a good idea.\n\nLearning from the experience is something to consider too. Even if I didn't do anything wrong, maybe there's a way to improve how I communicate or handle similar situations in the future. Building a good reputation by being honest and reliable could also help prevent such issues from happening again.\n\nIf the situation is really serious and I can't resolve it on my own, seeking legal advice might be necessary.

I know Jannah is like the Islamic concept of paradise, right? So, first, I should figure out what Islam says about suicide. I remember hearing that suicide is considered a major sin in Islam, but I'm not exactly sure why. Maybe it's because it's seen as a rejection of God's gift of life or something.\n\nI think the Quran mentions something about not killing oneself. Let me try to recall. I think there's a verse that says something like, \"And do not kill yourselves. Indeed, Allah is ever merciful to you.\" That might be from Surah Al-Nisa. So, if that's the case, suicide is forbidden and considered a sin.\n\nBut then, what happens after someone commits suicide? Do they automatically go to hell, or is there a chance for forgiveness? I remember hearing that only Allah can judge someone's fate, so maybe it's not so straightforward. Maybe the person's overall deeds and faith are considered.\n\nI also wonder if there are any hadiths about this. I think the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) mentioned that people who commit suicide will be in a punishment in the afterlife, like being in the fire and repeating the act. But I'm not sure if that's a direct hadith or just an interpretation.\n\nAnother thing to consider is mental health. If someone is suffering from mental illness and isn't in control of their actions, does that change the ruling? I know Islam emphasizes compassion and mercy, so maybe there's some leniency in such cases. But I'm not sure how scholars view this.\n\nI should also think about the concept of Jannah. It's not just about good deeds; it's about faith, intention, and Allah's mercy. So even if someone commits a major sin like suicide, if they were a believer, maybe there's still hope for mercy. But I don't know the specifics.\n\nI'm a bit confused because I've heard different opinions. Some people say that suicide leads to damnation, while others say that only Allah knows and we shouldn't judge. I think the correct approach is to rely on scholarly consensus rather than individual opinions.\n\nSo, to sum up, I think the Islamic stance is that suicide is a grave sin, but the final judgment is with Allah. The person's overall faith, circumstances, and mental state might be taken into account. But I'm not entirely sure, so I should look"}

Is it permissible to keep short hair as there is a hadith which mentions that Aisha (Radiyallahu Anaha) had short hair. ? --T--", "Answer": "In matters of Deen we are commanded to follow the Fuqaha. The Fuqaha are those experts in Deen who after carrying out an extensive and comprehensive study of the Quraan, the Mubarak Ahaadith of Rasulullah (Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam) and the verdicts of the Sahaabah (with all the related sciences that are required to understand Deen), deduce the masaail of Deen and explain to the Ummah the parameters of Shariah. Hence it would be a futile exercise for the person who is not knowledgeable and completely conversant with all the above-mentioned sciences of Deen, to try to challenge their verdicts. The Fuqaha have explained in the light of Shariah that it is impermissible for a woman to cut or trim her hair. Hence, If a woman cuts her hair, she will be sinful in the court of Allah Taala. Hazrat Aisha (Radiyallahu Anha) herself explains the reason for her hair not being very long. She says I had fallen ill and I suffered from hair loss until my hair became very short.

Purify yourself with it!\" Aishah said, as if whispering to her: \"Wipe away the traces of blood with it.\" Then she (Asma) asked him about bathing to cleanse oneself from sexual impurity.

I also want to know if it's permissible for women to cut their hair short, especially since there's a hadith mentioning Aisha had short hair.\n\nFirst, I remember that in Islam, modesty is a big deal for both men and women. For women, covering their hair is part of hijab. So, does that mean women must keep their hair long? I'm not sure. I think some cultures encourage long hair as a sign of beauty or modesty, but maybe that's more cultural than religious.\n\nThen, there's the hadith about Aisha. I think she was one of the wives of the Prophet Muhammad, and she had short hair. If that's the case, does that mean it's okay for women to have short hair? But wait, I also remember that some scholars say women should let their hair grow because it's part of their natural state. So, I'm a bit confused.\n\nI should check the sources. The Quran mentions covering the hair in Surah An-Nur, but does it specify the length? I don't think so. It just says to cover the bosoms and not display their adornment except to certain people. So, maybe the length isn't specified, making it more of a cultural practice.\n\nAs for cutting the hair, I've heard that trimming is allowed for cleanliness and beauty. But is cutting it very short permissible? Some might argue that it's not because it could make the woman look like a man, which is against the idea of maintaining femininity. But if Aisha had short hair, maybe that's acceptable.\n\nI should also consider different scholarly opinions. Some scholars might permit short hair as long as it's not imitating men, while others might discourage it, encouraging longer hair for modesty. So, the answer might depend on the interpretation and cultural context.\n\nIn conclusion, it seems that while there's no explicit religious ruling against short hair, cultural practices often emphasize long hair. Cutting hair for maintenance is permissible, but extremely short styles might be debated. Aisha's example could be used to support that short hair is allowed, provided it remains feminine and doesn't resemble a male haircut.\n</think>\n\nIn Islamic teachings, the ruling on women's hair length is primarily guided by modesty and cultural practices rather than explicit religious dictates.

Then he would say: So-and-so said this and that [So-and-so said this and that]. So when the Companions of the Prophet () would hear that poetry, they would say: By Allah!

As for his dependants, their only food was dates and barely. So an import arrived from Ash-Sham, and my uncle Rifaah bin Zaid bought a load of it, which he put in a storage area he had, where he kept his weapons - his shield and his sword.

We do not think the one you are looking for is other than Labid bin Sahl, a man among us who is righteous and accepted Islam. When Labid heard that, he brandished his sword and said: I stole? By Allah! You either prove this theft, or I take to you with this sword. They said: Leave us O man! You are not the one who has it. So we continued questioning in the dwellings until we had no doubt that they had taken it. So my uncle said to me: O my nephew!

They broken into his storage and took his weapons and his food. We want them to return our weapons, but we have no need for the food. So the Prophet () said: I will decide about that. So when Banu Ubairiq heard about that, they brought a man from among them named Usair bin Urwah to talk to him about that, and some people form their houses gathered and said: O Messenger of Allah! Qatadah bin An-Numan and his uncle came came to a family among us who are a people of Islam and righteousness, accusing them of stealing without proof or confirmation.\" Qatadah said: \"I went to the Messenger of Allah () and spoke to him, and he said: You went to a family among them known for their Islam and righteousness, and accused them of stealing without confirmation or proof.\" He said: \"So I returned wishing that I had lost some of my wealth, and that the Messenger of Allah () had not been spoke to about that. My uncle Rifaah came to me and said: O my nephew! What did you do? So I told him what the Messenger of Allah () said to me, so he said: It is from Allah, Whom we seek help. It was not long before the Quran was revealed: Surely, We have sent down to you the Book in truth, that you might judge between men by that which Allah has shown you, so be not a pelader for the treacherous. That is Banu Ubairiq. And seek forgiveness from Allah. [That is] from what you said to Qatadah. Certainly Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful. And argue not on behalf of those who deceive themselves. Verily, Allah does not like anyone who is a betrayer, sinner. They may hide from men, but they cannot hide from Allah for He is with them up to His saying: Most Merciful. That is: If you seek Allahs forgiveness then He will forgive you.

Qatadah said: \"When the weapon was brought to my uncle - and he was an elderly man with bad sight\" or \"an elderly weak man\" - Abu Eisa was in doubt - \"in Jahiliyyah, and I thought that he merely had entered into Islam (without real sincerity) but when I brought it to him, he said: O my nephew!

I remember reading somewhere that scholars must be respected, so I'm wondering if that means no discussions or debates, even if done politely.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the Quran and Hadith say about respecting scholars. I know the Quran mentions respecting people with knowledge, like in Surah Al-Mujadila where it says to lower your voice in the presence of the Prophet, but I'm not sure about other scholars. Maybe there are specific verses or hadiths about this.\n\nThen, I should think about the difference between respect and discussion. It's possible to respect someone while still engaging in a conversation, right? But maybe there's a line where discussion becomes disrespectful, especially in a casual setting.\n\nI also recall that in Islamic history, students would ask questions to scholars to clarify points. So maybe it's allowed as long as it's done with the right intention and manner. But how does that apply today? If a layperson has a question or a different viewpoint, can they express it without being considered disrespectful?\n\nI should consider the context. In a formal setting, like a lecture, it's probably better to listen and maybe ask questions after. But in a casual setting among friends, perhaps it's more acceptable. However, the person's intention is important—whether they're seeking knowledge or just arguing for the sake of it.\n\nAnother angle is the concept of ijma and seeking knowledge. Scholars are there to guide, so asking them questions is part of learning. But does that include discussing or debating? I think it's more about the approach—being humble and polite versus challenging their authority.\n\nI also wonder about cultural factors. In some cultures, respecting elders or scholars might mean not questioning them at all, while others encourage polite discussions. How does Islamic teaching reconcile this?\n\nMaybe I should look up specific hadiths or scholarly opinions on this. For example, the Prophet's companions used to ask him questions, which shows that seeking clarification is okay. But how does that apply to scholars today?\n\nI think the key points are: respect is important, but so is seeking knowledge. As long as the discussion is done politely and with the intention to learn, it's permissible. It's about the manner and intent, not the mere act of talking back.\n\nSo, in conclusion, it's not haram to have a casual, kind discussion with a"}

Let me try to break them down and think through each step.\n\nFirst question: If someone drinks alcohol and then consumes a soft drink and then water from a bottle, can the water be considered pure for consumption? I'm not entirely sure, but I remember that in Islam, anything intoxicated is considered impure. So if the bottle was used for alcohol, maybe it's impure. But does drinking something else after affect that? I'm a bit confused about how the impurity transfers. Maybe the bottle itself becomes impure if it held alcohol, and just rinsing it with other drinks doesn't purify it. So the water might still be impure because the bottle was contaminated. I should check what the rules are about containers that held impure substances.\n\nSecond question: If a family member is alcoholic, how does another person maintain purity for prayers regarding utensils and the house? Do they have to keep cleaning everything? I think that as long as the utensils and house aren't contaminated with impurities, they're fine. But if the alcoholic family member brings impure things into contact with them, then they might need cleaning. I'm not sure how often or how much cleaning is required. Maybe it's about avoiding direct contact with impurities and cleaning when necessary, but not excessively.\n\nI should probably look up some Islamic rulings on these topics. I recall that impurities can transfer through direct contact, so if a container held alcohol, it's impure. To purify it, it needs to be washed thoroughly. So in the first question, the bottle that held alcohol would need to be washed before it can be used for pure water. As for the second question, the person should avoid using utensils that have come into contact with alcohol and ensure the prayer area is clean. Maybe they don't have to clean everything all the time, just be mindful and clean when necessary.\n\nI'm still a bit unclear on the specifics, like how many times something needs to be washed to be considered pure again. I think there are specific rulings on washing vessels that have held intoxicants. Also, regarding the house, as long as there's no direct impurity, it's okay, but if there's a spill or contact, then cleaning is needed. I should find some reliable sources or fatwas that address these situations to get a clearer answer.\n</think>\n\n**Answer:**\n\n1. **"}

There is a man at Kufa who is a storyteller called Nauf; who claims that he (Al-Khadirs companion) is not Moses of Bani Israel.\" As for `Amr, he said to me, \"Ibn `Abbas said, \"(Nauf) the enemy of Allah told a lie.\" But Ya`la said to me, \"Ibn `Abbas said, Ubai bin Ka`b said, Allahs Apostle said, Once Moses, Allahs Apostle, preached to the people till their eyes shed tears and their hearts became tender, whereupon he finished his sermon. Then a man came to Moses and asked, O Allahs Apostle! Is there anyone on the earth who is more learned than you? Moses replied, No. So Allah admonished him (Moses), for he did not ascribe all knowledge to Allah. It was said, (on behalf of Allah), Yes, (there is a slave of ours who knows more than you ). Moses said, O my Lord! Where is he? Allah said, At the junction of the two seas. Moses said, O my Lord ! Tell I me of a sign whereby I will recognize the place. \" `Amr said to me, Allah said, \"That place will be where the fish will leave you.\" Ya`la said to me, \"Allah said (to Moses), Take a dead fish (and your goal will be) the place where it will become alive. \" So Moses took a fish and put it in a basket and said to his boy-servant \"I dont want to trouble you, except that you should inform me as soon as this fish leaves you.\" He said (to Moses).\" You have not demanded too much.\" And that is as mentioned by Allah: And (remember) when Moses said to his attendant ....  (18.60) Yusha` bin Noon. (Sa`id did not state that). The Prophet said, \"While the attendant was in the shade of the rock at a wet place, the fish slipped out (alive) while Moses was sleeping. His attend an said (to himself), \"I will not wake him, but when he woke up, he forgot to tell him The fish slipped out and entered the sea. Allah stopped the flow of the sea. where the fish was, so that its trace looked as if it was made on a rock. `Amr forming a hole with his two thumbs an index fingers, said to me, \"Like this, as in its trace was made on a rock.\" Moses said \"We have suffered much fatigue on this journey of ours.\" (This was not narrated by Sa`id). Then they returned back and found Al-Khadir. `Uthman bin Abi Sulaiman said to me, (they found him) on a green carpet in the middle of the sea. Al-Khadir was covered with his garment with one end under his feet and the other end under his head. When Moses greeted, he uncovered his face and said astonishingly, Is there such a greeting in my land? Who are you? Moses said, I am Moses. Al- Khadir said, Are you the Moses of Bani Israel? Moses said, Yes. Al-Khadir said, \"What do you want? Moses said,  I came to you so that you may teach me of the truth which you were taught. Al- Khadir said, Is it not sufficient for you that the Torah is in your hands and the Divine Inspiration comes to you, O Moses? Verily, I have a knowledge that you ought not learn, and you have a knowledge which I ought not learn. At that time a bird took with its beak (some water) from the sea: Al-Khadir then said, By Allah, my knowledge and your knowledge besides Allahs Knowledge is like what this bird has taken with its beak from the sea. Until, when they went on board the boat (18.71). They found a small boat which used to carry the people from this sea-side to the other sea-side. The crew recognized Al-Khadir and said, The pious slave of Allah. (We said to Sa`id \"Was that Khadir?\" He said, \"Yes.\") The boat men said, We will not get him on board with fare. Al-Khadir scuttled the boat and then plugged the hole with a piece o wood. Moses said, Have you scuttle it in order to drown these people surely, you have done a dreadful thing. (18.71) (Mujahid said. \"Moses said so protestingly.\") Al-Khadir said, didnt I say that you can have no patience with me? (18.72) The first inquiry of Moses was done because of forget fullness, the second caused him to be bound with a stipulation, and the third was done he intentionally. Moses said, Call me not to account for what I forgot and be not hard upon me for my affair (with you). (18.73) (Then) they found a boy and Al-Khadir killed him. Ya`la- said: Sa`id said They found boys playing and Al-Khadir got hold of a handsome infidel boy laid him down and then slew him with knife. Moses said, Have you killed a innocent soul who has killed nobody (18.74) Then they proceeded and found a wall which was on the point of falling down, and Al-Khadir set it up straight Sa`id moved his hand thus and said Al-Khadir raised his hand and the wall became straight. Ya`la said, I think Sa`id said, Al-Khadir touched the wall with his hand and it became straight (Moses said to Al-Khadir), If you had wished, you could have taken wages for it. Sa`id said, Wages that we might had eaten. And there was a king in furor (ahead) of them\" (18.79) And there was in front of them. Ibn `Abbas recited: In front of them (was) a king. It is said on the authority of somebody other than Sa`id that the king was Hudad bin Budad. They say that the boy was called Haisur. A king who seized every ship by force. (18.79) So I wished that if that boat passed by him, he would leave it because of its defect and when they have passed they would repair it and get benefit from it. Some people said that they closed that hole with a bottle, and some said with tar. His parents were believers, and he (the boy) was a non-believer and we(Khadir) feared lest he would oppress them by obstinate rebellion and disbelief. (18.80) (i.e. that their love for him would urge them to follow him in his religion, so we (Khadir) desired that their Lord should change him for them for one better in righteousness and near to mercy (18:81). This was in reply to Moses saying: Have you killed an innocent soul.? (18.74). Near to mercy\" means they will be more merciful to him than they were to the former whom Khadir had killed.

The question is asking whether wiping once with a wet cloth or tissue is enough, or if you need to wipe three times. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. It seems like this is related to some sort of purity or cleanliness ritual, maybe from a religious or cultural practice. The term \"impure hand\" suggests that after intimate relations, the hand is considered impure and needs to be cleaned before touching other things.\n\nI'm not entirely sure about the specific rules here, but I think different traditions have different guidelines. For example, in some cultures, certain numbers have significance, like three being a number of completeness or thoroughness. So, maybe wiping three times is more about ensuring the area is properly cleaned rather than just a symbolic gesture.\n\nOn the other hand, using a wet cloth or tissue might be considered sufficient after one wipe if it's done thoroughly. It could depend on how soiled the surface is. If it's just a light touch, one wipe might be enough, but if there's more substance, maybe three times is better to ensure it's clean.\n\nI also wonder if this is related to hygiene practices. In general, cleaning surfaces, especially after contact with bodily fluids, is important to prevent the spread of infections. So, the number of wipes might be more about ensuring all residue is removed rather than a specific rule.\n\nI'm not sure if there's a specific religious text or guideline that dictates this. Maybe in Islamic practices, for example, there are certain rules about purification. I think they have rules about how to clean after intimate relations, maybe using water and specific methods. But I'm not certain about the exact number of times.\n\nAnother angle is the practical aspect. If you wipe once and the area is still dirty, then you need to wipe again. So, it might not be about the number of times, but ensuring the area is clean. However, the question specifically asks whether once is enough or if three times is necessary, so it's probably referring to a specific guideline.\n\nI should also consider that different materials might require different cleaning. For example, a table made of wood versus one made of glass might need different cleaning approaches. But the question is more about the number of wipes rather than the material.\n\nIn summary, I think the answer depends on the specific cultural or religious guidelines the person is following.

I know that in Islam, there are certain rules about physical contact between men and women who are not mahram (close relatives). The user is asking about specific scenarios where there might not be direct physical contact, but there's still some form of proximity, like feeling body heat, and whether that would fall under musahara.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what musahara means. From what I remember, musahara refers to touching a woman with lust, and this is considered haram (forbidden) in Islam. The ruling applies even if there's a barrier, like clothing, as long as body heat can be felt. So, the key elements here are the intention of lust and the physical contact, even through a barrier.\n\nNow, the user is asking about a situation where there's no physical contact at all, but the person is in close proximity and can feel the other person's body heat. They also mention that the man felt lust at the time of feeling this heat. So, the question is whether this scenario would still necessitate the ruling of musahara.\n\nI think the first thing to consider is the definition of musahara. If musahara specifically requires some form of physical contact, even through a barrier, then merely feeling body heat without any contact might not fall under the same ruling. However, I'm not entirely sure about this. It might depend on the interpretation of Islamic scholars.\n\nThe user also asks whether the restriction is based on any lust or if an erection must occur in the male. This makes me think about whether the physical reaction is necessary for the ruling to apply. In some Islamic rulings, intentions and physical reactions can play a role in determining the applicability of certain rules.\n\nI should check some sources or fatwas to see how scholars have addressed this. From what I recall, some scholars consider that even if there's no direct contact, but there's a deliberate closeness with the intention of lust, it could be considered haram. However, the specific term musahara might still require some form of contact.\n\nAlso, regarding the physical reaction like an erection, I think the primary factor is the intention and the action, not necessarily the physical response. So, even if there's no erection, if the touching was done with lustful intent, it would still be haram.\n\nBut I'm not certain about this. I"}

I'm a bit confused about whether it's a sin for me to touch pork and if my paycheck from this job is haram because I'm handling haram meat.\n\nFirst, I know that in Islam, pork is considered haram, which means it's forbidden to eat. But I'm not sure about touching it. I've heard that some people avoid even touching pork, while others might say it's not a big deal. I should probably look into what Islamic teachings say about this. Maybe there are specific verses in the Quran or hadiths that address this.\n\nThen there's the issue of my income. I'm working in a place that serves haram food, so I'm worried that my earnings might not be halal. I've heard that earning a living through haram means is not permissible. But I'm not entirely sure how this applies to my situation. Do I need to find a different job, or is there a way to continue working here without sinning?\n\nI also wonder if there are any exceptions or if the situation changes based on necessity. For example, if I can't find another job, does that make my current job permissible? I should check if Islamic scholars have discussed similar scenarios and what their rulings are.\n\nAnother thing to consider is the separation of tasks. If I'm only handling halal foods and not directly involved in preparing or serving pork, maybe that's different. But in a fast-food setting, it's possible that I might come into contact with pork products even if I'm not directly handling them. So I need to think about how much contact I actually have with haram items.\n\nI also think about the intention behind my work. If my main goal is to provide for myself and my family in a way that's permissible, but my job requires me to handle haram products, does that taint my earnings? Or is it more about the direct actions I take, like whether I'm the one serving the pork or not.\n\nMaybe I should reach out to a local imam or a trusted Islamic scholar to get their opinion. They might provide guidance based on my specific circumstances. Alternatively, looking up reliable sources online could give me some clarity. I should make sure the sources are credible and well-respected in the Islamic community.\n\nIn summary, I need to understand the Islamic rulings on touching pork and whether working in an environment where haram food is served"}

During a Ghazwa of his, he drew lots amongst us and the lot fell upon me, and I proceeded with him after Allah had decreed the use of the veil by women. I was carried in a Howdah (on the camel) and dismounted while still in it. When Allahs Apostle was through with his Ghazwa and returned home, and we approached the city of Medina, Allahs Apostle ordered us to proceed at night. When the order of setting off was given, I walked till I was past the army to answer the call of nature. After finishing I returned (to the camp) to depart (with the others) and suddenly realized that my necklace over my chest was missing. So, I returned to look for it and was delayed because of that. The people who used to carry me on the camel, came to my Howdah and put it on the back of the camel, thinking that I was in it, as, at that time, women were light in weight, and thin and lean, and did not use to eat much. So, those people did not feel the difference in the heaviness of the Howdah while lifting it, and they put it over the camel. At that time I was a young lady. They set the camel moving and proceeded on. I found my necklace after the army had gone, and came to their camp to find nobody. So, I went to the place where I used to stay, thinking that they would discover my absence and come back in my search. While in that state, I felt sleepy and slept. Safwan bin Muattal As-Sulami Adh-Dhakwani was behind the army and reached my abode in the morning. When he saw a sleeping person, he came to me, and he used to see me before veiling. So, I got up when I heard him saying, \"Inna lil-lah-wa inn a ilaihi rajiun (We are for Allah, and we will return to Him).\" He made his camel knell down. He got down from his camel, and put his leg on the front legs of the camel and then I rode and sat over it. Safwan set out walking, leading the camel by the rope till we reached the army who had halted to take rest at midday. Then whoever was meant for destruction, fell into destruction, (some people accused me falsely) and the leader of the false accusers was `Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul. After that we returned to Medina, and I became ill for one month while the people were spreading the forged statements of the false accusers. I was feeling during my ailment as if I were not receiving the usual kindness from the Prophet which I used to receive from him when I got sick. But he would come, greet and say, How is that (girl)? I did not know anything of what was going on till I recovered from my ailment and went out with Um Mistah to the Manasi where we used to answer the call of nature, and we used not to go to answer the call of nature except from night to night and that was before we had lavatories near to our houses. And this habit of ours was similar to the habit of the old Arabs in the open country (or away from houses). So. I and Um Mistah bint Ruhm went out walking. Um Mistah stumbled because of her long dress and on that she said, Let Mistah be ruined. I said, You are saying a bad word. Why are you abusing a man who took part in (the battle of) Badr? She said, O Hanata (you there) didnt you hear what they said? Then she told me the rumors of the false accusers. My sickness was aggravated, and when I returned home, Allahs Apostle came to me, and after greeting he said, How is that (girl)? I requested him to allow me to go to my parents. I wanted then to be sure of the news through them I Allahs Apostle allowed me, and I went to my parents and asked my mother, What are the people talking about? She said, O my daughter! Dont worry much about this matter. By Allah, never is there a charming woman loved by her husband who has other wives, but the women would forge false news about her. I said, Glorified be Allah! Are the people really taking of this matter? That night I kept on weeping and could not sleep till morning. In the morning Allahs Apostle called `Ali bin Abu Talib and Usama bin Zaid when he saw the Divine Inspiration delayed, to consul them about divorcing his wife (i.e. `Aisha). Usama bin Zaid said what he knew of the good reputation of his wives and added, O Allahs Apostle! Keep you wife, for, by Allah, we know nothing about her but good. `Ali bin Abu Talib said, O Allahs Apostle! Allah has no imposed restrictions on you, and there are many women other than she, yet you may ask the woman-servant who will tell you the truth. On that Allahs Apostle called Buraira and said, O Burair. Did you ever see anything which roused your suspicions about her? Buraira said, No, by Allah Who has sent you with the Truth, I have never seen in her anything faulty except that she is a girl of immature age, who sometimes sleeps and leaves the dough for the goats to eat. On that day Allahs Apostle ascended the pulpit and requested that somebody support him in punishing `Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul. Allahs Apostle said, Who will support me to punish that person (`Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul) who has hurt me by slandering the reputation of my family? By Allah, I know nothing about my family but good, and they have accused a person about whom I know nothing except good, and he never entered my house except in my company. Sa`d bin Mu`adh got up and said, O Allahs Apostle! by Allah, I will relieve you from him. If that man is from the tribe of the Aus, then we will chop his head off, and if he is from our brothers, the Khazraj, then order us, and we will fulfill your order. On that Sa`d bin Ubada, the chief of the Khazraj and before this incident, he had been a pious man, got up, motivated by his zeal for his tribe and said, By Allah, you have told a lie; you cannot kill him, and you will never be able to kill him. On that Usaid bin Al-Hadir got up and said (to Sa`d bin Ubada), By Allah! you are a liar. By Allah, we will kill him; and you are a hypocrite, defending the hypocrites. On this the two tribes of Aus and Khazraj got excited and were about to fight each other, while Allahs Apostle was standing on the pulpit. He got down and quieted them till they became silent and he kept quiet. On that day I kept on weeping so much so that neither did my tears stop, nor could I sleep. In the morning my parents were with me and I had wept for two nights and a day, till I thought my liver would burst from weeping. While they were sitting with me and I was weeping, an Ansari woman asked my permission to enter, and I allowed her to come in. She sat down and started weeping with me. While we were in this state, Allahs Apostle came and sat down and he had never sat with me since the day they forged the accusation. No revelation regarding my case came to him for a month. He recited Tashah-hud (i.e. None has the right to be worshipped but Allah and Muhammad is His Apostle) and then said, O `Aisha! I have been informed such-and-such about you; if you are innocent, then Allah will soon reveal your innocence, and if you have committed a sin, then repent to Allah and ask Him to forgive you, for when a person confesses his sin and asks Allah for forgiveness, Allah accepts his repentance. When Allahs Apostle finished his speech my tears ceased completely and there remained not even a single drop of it. I requested my father to reply to Allahs Apostle on my behalf. My father said, By Allah, I do not know what to say to Allahs Apostle. I said to my mother, Talk to Allahs Apostle on my behalf. She said, By Allah, I do not know what to say to Allahs Apostle. I was a young girl and did not have much knowledge of the Quran. I said. I know, by Allah, that you have listened to what people are saying and that has been planted in your minds and you have taken it as a truth. Now, if I told you that I am innocent and Allah knows that I am innocent, you would not believe me and if I confessed to you falsely that I am guilty, and Allah knows that I am innocent you would believe me. By Allah, I dont compare my situation with you except to the situation of Josephs father (i.e. Jacob) who said, So (for me) patience is most fitting against that which you assert and it is Allah (Alone) whose help can be sought. Then I turned to the other side of my bed hoping that Allah would prove my innocence. By Allah I never thought that Allah would reveal Divine Inspiration in my case, as I considered myself too inferior to be talked of in the Holy Quran. I had hoped that Allahs Apostle might have a dream in which Allah would prove my innocence. By Allah, Allahs Apostle had not got up and nobody had left the house before the Divine Inspiration came to Allahs Apostle. So, there overtook him the same state which used to overtake him, (when he used to have, on being inspired divinely). He was sweating so much so that the drops of the sweat were dropping like pearls though it was a (cold) wintry day. When that state of Allahs Apostle was over, he was smiling and the first word he said, `Aisha! Thank Allah, for Allah has declared your innocence. My mother told me to go to Allahs Apostle . I replied, By Allah I will not go to him and will not thank but Allah. So Allah revealed: \"Verily! They who spread the slander are a gang among you . . .\" (24.11) When Allah gave the declaration of my Innocence, Abu Bakr, who used to provide for Mistah bin Uthatha for he was his relative, said, By Allah, I will never provide Mistah with anything because of what he said about Aisha. But Allah later revealed: -- \"And let not those who are good and wealthy among you swear not to help their kinsmen, those in need and those who left their homes in Allahs Cause. Let them forgive and overlook. Do you not wish that Allah should forgive you? Verily! Allah is Oft-forgiving, Most Merciful.\" (24.22) After that Abu Bakr said, Yes ! By Allah! I like that Allah should forgive me, and resumed helping Mistah whom he used to help before. Allahs Apostle also asked Zainab bint Jahsh (i.e. the Prophets wife about me saying, What do you know and what did you see? She replied, O Allahs Apostle! I refrain to claim hearing or seeing what I have not heard or seen. By Allah, I know nothing except goodness about Aisha.\" Aisha further added \"Zainab was competing with me (in her beauty and the Prophets love), yet Allah protected her (from being malicious), for she had piety.\"<D>(And those who look not for a meeting with Us) those who do not believe in resurrection after death, i.e. Abu Jahl and his host (say: Why are angels not sent down unto us) to inform us that Allah sent you to us (and (why) do we not see our Lord) to ask Him about you? (Assuredly they think too highly of themselves) to simply believe; it is also said that this means: they think too highly of themselves when they ask to see Allah, (and are scornful with great pride) refusing to believe; it is also said that they dared to ask for a tremendous thing when they asked for the angels to come to them.<D>(Allah hath decreed: Lo! I verily shall conquer, I and My messengers) i.e. Muhammad (pbuh) they shall conquer Persia, Byzantium, the hypocrites and the Jews. (Lo! Allah is Strong) through giving help to his prophets, (Almighty) in retribution against His enemies. This was revealed about Abdullah Ibn Ubayy Ibn Salul who said to the true believers: Do you really think that you shall conquer Persia and Byzantium?.<D>(Then said: Lo! I feel sick!) so that they leave him alone. ", "Generated_Answer": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm feeling really down about myself and confused because people seem to have negative feelings towards me, and I don't even know why. It's making me feel guilty for no reason, and I don't like how I look or act sometimes. I'm not sure what's going on or how to fix it. I want to find an Islamic way to deal with this because I know Islam has guidance for everything, but I'm not exactly sure where to start.\n\nFirst, I think I should understand why I'm feeling this way. Maybe I'm being too sensitive or misinterpreting others' behavior. I remember reading that in Islam, having a good opinion of others (husn al-dhann) is important. So maybe I should try to assume people have good intentions unless I know for sure otherwise. But it's hard when I feel like people are judging me or looking at me strangely.\n\nI also feel like I don't like my behavior or looks. That's making me feel low about myself. I know Islam teaches self-compassion and that we should focus on our inner qualities. The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) said something about not considering ourselves better than others, so maybe I need to work on my humility and not compare myself to others.\n\nI should probably start with some specific duas. I remember there's a duaa for seeking refuge from lowly aspirations, which is \"Allahumma inni a'udhu bika min al-hammi wal-hazani, wal-jubni wal-bukhli, wa dhale-il amali, wa khidhlan il-amal.\" That might help me with feeling sad and guilty without reason. Also, the duaa for self-compassion, \"Allahumma anta rabbi, la ilaha illa anta, khalaqtani wa ana abduka, wa ana ala ahdika wa wa'dika mastata'tu,\" could help me remember that I'm a slave to Allah and should seek His help.\n\nI think reflecting on my actions might be useful. Maybe I'm doing something unintentionally that's causing people to react negatively. But if I'm not doing anything wrong, then their perceptions might be their own issues. Focusing on my relationship with Allah could help me be more at peace. Performing my prayers on time and with concentration might make me feel more connected and less worried about what others think.\n\nSeeking knowledge is another point.

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that istibraa is the process after urinating where a person ensures that no more urine is left. It involves things like squeezing the penis, moving the organ, etc., to make sure nothing is left. So, I did that and felt like I was done. But then, when I go to wash or bathe, I feel these drops again. That's confusing because I thought I was finished.\n\nI wonder if these drops are actually urine or something else. Maybe it's just my body reacting to the water. Sometimes when you wash, the warmth or the pressure of the water can cause a little discharge, but I'm not sure if that's urine or just normal moisture. I should check the color and consistency. If it's clear and not yellow, maybe it's not urine. But if it's yellowish, then it might be.\n\nI also need to consider how much is coming out. If it's just a tiny drop, maybe it's not a big deal. But if it's more, I should be concerned. I should also think about whether this happens every time I wash or only sometimes. Consistency might help determine if it's a one-off thing or a recurring issue.\n\nNext, I should think about how to handle it. If I'm unsure whether it's urine or not, maybe I should do istibraa again after feeling the drops. That way, I can make sure I'm completely clean. Also, when washing, maybe I can be more careful about how I clean myself, ensuring that the area is thoroughly washed without applying too much pressure that might cause any remaining drops to come out.\n\nI also recall that sometimes after istibraa, there might be a small amount of discharge, especially if the bladder isn't completely empty. Maybe I need to wait a bit longer after urinating before considering myself done. Or perhaps I should try different positions or techniques during istibraa to make sure everything is out.\n\nI should also consider consulting someone knowledgeable, like a scholar or a medical professional, because they can give more precise advice based on both Islamic rulings and medical knowledge. It's possible that there's a physical reason for this, and a doctor might be able to help me"}

And his servant too had a Maafiri mantle over him. My father said to him: My uncle, I see the signs of anger or that of agony on your face. He said: Yes, such and such person, the son of so and so, of the tribe of Harami owed me a debt. I went to his family, extended salutations and said: Where is he? They said: He is not here. Then came out to me his son who was at the threshold of his youth. I said to him: Where is your father? He said: No sooner did he hear your sound than he hid himself behind my mothers bedstead. I said to him: Walk out to me, for I know where you are. He came out. I said to him: What prompted you to hide yourself from me? He said: By God, whatever I would say to you would not be a lie. By Allah, I fear that I should tell a lie to you and in case of making promise with you I should break it, as you are the Companion of Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him). The fact is that I was hard up in regard to money. I said: Do you adjure by Allah? He said: I adjure by Allah. I said: Do you adjure by Allah? He said: I adjure by Allah. I said: Do you adjure by Allah? He said: I adjure by Allah. Then he brought his promissory note and he wrote off (the debt) with his hand and said: Make payment when you find yourself solvent enough to pay me back; if you are not, then there is no liability upon you. These two eyes of mine saw, and he (AbuI-Yasar) placed his fingers upon his eyes and these two ears of mine heard and my heart retained, and he pointed towards his heart that Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: He who gives time to one who is financially hard up (in the payment of debt) or writes off his debt, Allah will provide him His shadow. I said to him: My uncle, if you get the cloak of your servant and you give him your two clothes, or take his two clothes of Maafir and give him your cloak, then there would be one dress for you and one for him. He wiped my head and said: O Allah, bless the son of my brother. O, son of my brother, these two very eyes of mine saw and these two ears of mine listened to and this heart of mine retained this, and he pointed towards the heart that Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: Feed them (the servants) and clothe them (the servants) what you wear, and if I give him the goods of the world, it is easy for me than this that he should take my virtues on the Day of Resurrection. We went on till we came to Jabir b. Abdullah in the mosque and he was busy in observing prayer in one cloth which he had joined at its opposite ends. I made my way through the people till I sat between him and the Qibla and I said: May Allah have mercy upon you. Do you observe prayer with one cloth on your body whereas your mantle is lying at your side? He pointed me with his hand towards my breast just like this and he separated his fingers and bent them in the shape of a bow. And (he said): I thought that a fool like you should come to me so that he should see me as I do and he should then also do like it. Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) came to us in this very mosque and he had in his hand the twig of the palm-tree and he saw mucus towards the Qibla of the mosque and he erased it with the help of the twig. He then came to us and said: Who amongst you likes that Allah should turn His face away from him? We were afraid. He then again said: Who amongst you likes that Allah should turn His face away from him? We were afraid. He again said: Who amongst you likes that Allah should turn His face away from him? We said: Allahs Messenger, none of us likes it. And he said: If one amongst you stands for prayer, Allah, the Exalted and Glorious, is before him he should not spit in front of him, or on his right side, but should spit on his left side beneath his left foot and if he is impelled to do so all of a sudden (in spite of himself) he should then spit in his cloth and fold it in some part of it. (and he further said: ) Bring some sweet-smelling thing. A young man who belonged to our tribe stood up, went and brought scent in his palm. Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) took that and applied it to the end of that twig and then touched the place where there had been mucus. Jabir said: This is why you should apply scent to your mosques. It is reported on the same authority: We set out along with Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) on an expedition of Batn Buwat. He (the Holy Prophet) was in search of al-Majdi b. Amr al-Juhani. (We had so meagre equipment) that five. six or seven of us had one camel to ride and so we mounted it turn by turn. Once there wan. the turn of an Ansari to ride upon the camel. He made it kneel down to ride over it (and after having. mounted it), he tried to raise it up but it hesitated. So he said. May there be curse of Allah upon you! Thereupon Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: Who is there to curse his camel? He said: Allahs Messenger, it is I. Thereupon he said: Get down from the camel and let us not have in our company the cursed one. Dont curse your own selves, nor your children. nor your belongings. There is the possibility that your curse may synchronies with the time when Allah is about to confer upon you what you demand and thus your prayer may be readily responded. It is reported on the same authority: We set out on an expedition along with Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) until it was evening, and we had been near a. water reservoir of Arabia. Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: Who would be the person who would go ahead and set right the reservoir and drink water himself and serve us with it? Jabir said: I stood up and said: Allahs Messenger, it is I who am ready to do that. Thereupon Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: Who is the person to accompany Jabir? And then Jabbar b. Sakhr stood up. So we went to that well and poured in that tank a bucket or two of water and plastered it with clay and then began to fill it (with water) until it was filled to the brim. Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) was the first who appeared before us, and he said: Do you (both) permit me to drink water out of it? We said: Yea, Allahs Messenger. He led his camel to drink water and it drank. He then pulled its rein and it stretched its legs and began to urinate. He then took it aside and made it kneel down at another place and then came to the tank and performed ablution. I then got up and performed ablution like the ablution of Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him), and Jabbar b. Sakhr went in order to relieve himself and Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) got up to observe prayer and there was a mantle over me. I tried to invert its ends but it was too short (to cover my body easily). It had its borders. I then inverted it (the mantle) and drew its opposite ends and then tied them at my neck. I then came and stood upon the left side of Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him). He caught hold of me and made me go round behind him, until he made me stand on his right side. Then Jabbar b. Sakhr came. He performed ablution and then came and stood on the left side of Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him). Then Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) caught hold of our hands together, pushed us back and made us stand behind him. Then Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) began to look upon me with darting looks, but I did not perceive that. After that I became aware of it and he pointed with the gesture of his hand that I should wrap my loin-cloth. When Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) had finished the prayer, he said: Jabir! I said: Allahs Messenger, at thy beck and call. He said: When the cloth around you is inadequate, then tie the opposite ends but when it is small, tie it over the lower body. Jabir reported: We set out on an expedition with Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) and the only means of sustenance for every person amongst us was only one date for a day and we used to chew it. And we struck the leaves with the help of our bow and ate them until the sides of our mouths were injured. It so happened one day that a person was overlooked and not given a date. We carried that person and bore witness to the fact that he had not been given that date so he was offered that and he got up and received that. Jabir reported: We set out on an expedition along with Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) until we got down at a spacious valley and Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) went to relieve himself. I followed him with a bucket full of water and Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) looked about and he found no privacy but two trees at the end of the valley and Allahs Messenger (may. peace be upon him) went to one of them and took hold of one of its twigs and said: Be thou under my control by the permission of Allah, and so it came under his control like the camel who has its nosestring in the hand of its rider, and then he came to the second tree and took hold of a twig and said: Be thou under my control with the permission of Allah, and it came under his control, and when he came in the middle of the two trees he joined together the two twigs and said: join with the permission of Allah. Jabir said: I was afraid lest Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) should be aware of my nearness and go still farther. And Muhammad b. Abbad has used the word\" faitabd\" and I began to talk to myself. And as I saw, I suddenly found Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) before me and the two trees were separated and each one of them was standing at its place. I saw Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) standing for a short time, nodding his head towards right and left. Ismail pointed towards the right and left with the help of his head (in order to demonstrate how the Holy Prophet had pointed). Then he (the Holy Prophet) came to me and said: Jabir did you see my place where I was standing? I said: Allahs Messenger, yes. He then said: Then you should go to those two trees and cut a twig from each of them and go to that place with them where I was standing and stand there where I was standing and place a twig on the right and a twig on the left. Jabir said: I set out and took hold of a stone and broke it and sharpened it and then I came to those trees and cut a twig from each one of them. I then came dragging them until I stood at the place where Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) had been standing and placed a twig on the right and a twig on the left. Then I met him and said: Allahs Messenger, I have done that, but (kindly) explain to me the reason for it. Thereupon he said: I passed by two graves the occupants of which had been undergoing torment. I liked to make intercession for them so that the might be relieved of this torment y as long as these twigs remain fresh. Jabir said: We came back to the (camp of the) army and Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: Jabir, call people for per- forming wudu. I cried: Come and perform wudu, come and perform wudu, come and perform wudu. I said: Allahs Messenger, there is not even a drop of water in the army camp, and there. was a person who used to cool the water for Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) in the old water-skin which kept hanging by the twig. He asked me to go to such and such Ansari and ask him to see if there was any water in that skin. I went to him and cast a glance in it but did not find anything but a drop in the mouth of that water-skin and if I were to draw that, the water-skins,. dried part would suck it up. I came to Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) and said: Allahs Messenger, I have not found anything in it but a drop of water in the mouth of the water-skin and now if I were to draw that, it would be absorbed. He said: Go and bring that to me. I brought that to him. He took hold of it -and began to utter something which I could not understand and then pressed it with his hand and gave that to me and said: Jabir, announce for the tub to be brought. So I announced that the tub of the army (be brought). It was brought accordingly and I placed it before him (the Holy Prophet). Thereupon Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) placed his hands in the tub like this: with his fingers stretched out, and then he placed his fingers at the bottom of the tub and said: Jabir, take it (that waters-skin) and pour water over me, by reciting Bismillah, and I poured water and I said: Bismillah, and found water sprouting out between the fingers of Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him). Then that tub gushed forth until it was filled up and the Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: Jabir, make an announcement to the effect: He who needs water should take that. Jabir said: The people came and got water until they were all satiated. I said: Is there anyone left who wants to get it? And Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) then lifted up his hand from that tub and it was still full. Then the people made a complaint to Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) about hunger and he said: May Allah provide you food! We came to the bank of the ocean and the ocean was tossing and it threw out a big animal and we lit fire and cooked it and took it until we had eaten to our hearts content. Jabir said: I and such and such five persons entered Its socket and nobody could see us until we had come out, and we took hold of one of its ribs and twisted it into a sort of arch, then we called the tallest of the persons of the army and the hugest of the camels of the army and it had the big saddle over it, and it could easily pass through it without the rider having need to bend down.<D>It wasnarrated from Anas bin Malik that the Prophet () said:“Whoeverperforms ablution on Friday, it is well and good for him, andhe hasdone what is obligatory for him. But whoever takes a bath, bathisbetter.”<D>Nafi’ said It was Ibn ‘Umar’s habit that whenever he came to Makkah he spent the night at Dhu Tuwa in the morning he would take a bath and enter Makkah in the daytime. He used to say the Prophet () had done so.<D> (Who set some other god along with Allah) they acknowledge different other gods along with Allah. (Butthey will come to know) what will be done with them. Allah destroyed, in the span of one night and oneday, each one of them by means of a different torment. These were five in number, among them was al-As Ibn Wail al-Sahmi who was stung by something and died on the spot, may Allah keep him far from His mercy. And among them was al-Harth Ibn Qays al-Sahmi who ate salted fish which made him very thirsty. He drank so much water that his stomach burst open and he died, may Allah ruin him. And among themwas al-Aswad Ibn Abd al-Muttalib whose head Gabriel banged on a tree and then hit his face with thorns until he died, may Allah curse him. And among them is al-Aswad Ibn Abd Yaghuth who left his house in an extremely hot day and was caught by the simoom such that his colour turned black and resembled an Abyssinian. He went back to his house, but they refused to open the door for him. He banged the door with his head so hard that he died, may Allah forsake him. And among them was al-Walid Ibn al-Mughirah al- Makhzumi who died as a result of an arrow which grazed his anklebone, may Allah banish him. All these people used to say before they died: the Lord of Muhammad (pbuh) has killed me.<D>Allah then taught them what they ought to learn in their dealings, saying: (O ye who believe!) in Allah and His Messenger (when ye contract a debt for a fixed term, record it) i.e. the debt (in writing. Let a scribe record it in writing between you) the indebted person and the creditor (in (terms of) equity) justice. (No scribe should refuse to write) the contract between the creditor and the debtor (as Allah hath taught him) how to write, (so let him write) the contract without addition or omission, (and let him who incurreth the debt dictate) i.e. the indebted person should explain to the scribe the debt he owes, (and let him observe his duty to Allah his Lord) let the indebted person fear his Lord, (and diminish naught thereof) and not diminish any amount of debt he owes upon dictation. (But if he who oweth the debt is of low understanding) is ignorant of dictation, (or weak) unable to dictate, (or unable himself to dictate) does not know how to dictate to the scribe, (then let the guardian of his interests dictate) the guardian of his wealth who is the creditor (in (terms of) equity) without any addition. (And call to witness) for your rights, (from among your men, two witnesses) from among your free, Muslim men who are of good character. (And if two men be not (at hand) then a man and two women, of such as ye approve as witnesses) from among people who are reliable in their witness, (so that if the one erreth (through forgetfulness)) so that if one of the women forgets (the other) who did not forget (will remind her. And the witnesses must not refuse) togive witness (when they are summoned) to court. (Be not averse) disinclined (to writing down) i.e. the debt(whether it be small or great, with (record of) the term thereof. That) i.e. that which I mentioned regarding the writing down of the debt (is more equitable) more correct and fairer (in the sight of Allah and more sure for testimony) clearer for the witness when he gives his testimony if he happens to forget, (and the bestway of avoiding doubt between you) concerning the debt and the fixed term of its payment; (save only inthe case when it is actual merchandise which you transfer among yourselves from hand to hand. In that case it is no sin) there is no harm (for you if ye write it not) the transaction. (And have witnesses when ye sell one to another) on credit, (and let no harm be done to scribe) by committing the transaction to writing (or witness) by giving his witness, that is, do not coerce them to do so. (If ye do (harm to them)) if you harm them, (lo! It is a sin in you. Observe your duty to Allah) fear Allah for causing such harm.

Hmm, let me think. Okay, ghusl is the Islamic ritual bath, right? It's important for purification before certain acts like prayer or fasting. So, the user is saying their bathtub is positioned such that when they take a bath, their back is facing the qibla. Qibla is the direction towards the Kaaba in Mecca, which Muslims face during prayers.\n\nI remember that in Islam, facing the qibla is significant, especially during prayers and other acts of worship. But what about during ghusl? Is there a specific direction one should face? I'm not entirely sure, but I think the rules might be a bit different for ghusl compared to salah.\n\nWait, I recall that during salah, facing the qibla is obligatory. But for ghusl, I'm not sure if the same rule applies. Maybe it's more about the intention and the actual act of purification rather than the direction one is facing. So perhaps the direction isn't as critical as long as the act of ghusl is performed correctly.\n\nBut the user is concerned because their back is to the qibla. I should check some sources or think about similar situations. I remember reading that turning one's back to the qibla during salah is not allowed, but ghusl is a different matter. Maybe it's permissible as long as the person isn't intentionally disrespecting the qibla.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the direction doesn't matter at all for ghusl. So if the bathtub is facing away from the qibla, it's still acceptable. But the user might feel uncomfortable about it, thinking it's disrespectful. In that case, what can they do? Maybe rearrange the bathtub, but that might not be feasible. Or perhaps they can perform ghusl in a different part of the bathroom where they can face the qibla.\n\nI think the key point is that while facing the qibla is important in certain acts of worship, ghusl might not require it. However, if it makes the person feel better or more respectful, they could try to adjust their position if possible. But it's not a strict requirement, so their ghusl would still be valid regardless of the direction.\n\nI should also consider different opinions or scholars' views on this. Maybe some scholars have addressed this specific scenario. But generally, I think the consensus is that ghusl doesn"}

I remember hearing that there's a Hadith about this, so I should start by recalling that.\n\nFrom what I know, the Hadith mentions that the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) said something about men wearing their garments above their ankles because trailing garments are from arrogance, and God doesn't like arrogance. So that's the basis for this practice.\n\nNow, focusing on the four Imams. I think each of them might have slightly different interpretations or rulings based on this Hadith. Let me try to break it down one by one.\n\nStarting with Imam Abu Hanifa. I believe the Hanafi school generally holds that wearing clothes above the ankles is recommended but not strictly obligatory. They might consider it a Sunnah, something the Prophet did, so it's good to follow, but not a hard rule. If someone's pants go below the ankle, it might not be considered a major sin, but it's better to avoid.\n\nNext, Imam Malik. The Maliki school might have a slightly different take. I think they could view it as more of a recommendation as well, but perhaps with a bit more emphasis. They might say it's better to wear above the ankle to follow the Sunnah, but again, not necessarily haram if it's below.\n\nMoving on to Imam al-Shafi'i. The Shafi'i school, if I recall correctly, might have a stricter view. They could consider it makruh (disliked) to have the pants below the ankle. So, while it's not haram, it's definitely something to avoid because it goes against the Sunnah.\n\nLastly, Imam Ahmad ibn Hanbal, the founder of the Hanbali school. I think the Hanbalis might have the strictest view here. They could consider it haram to wear pants below the ankle, especially if it's done out of arrogance. This would make it a more serious issue in their view.\n\nWait, but I'm not entirely sure about the differences. Maybe I should double-check. For instance, in the Hanafi school, is it just a recommendation or is there any condition where it might be considered makruh? And with the Hanbalis, is it outright haram or just strongly disliked?\n\nAlso, I should consider if the Imams had any specific reasons for their rulings"}

The person is concerned about being sexually impure, known as napaak, and how that affects their daily activities, especially after showering. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that in Islam, certain activities can make a person impure, like sexual intercourse or menstruation. The person is menstruating and is worried about their state of purity. They showered not for the purpose of becoming pure (which I think is called ghusl) but just a regular shower. Now they're worried that everything they touch becomes impure because of their menstrual state.\n\nThey mentioned that their hair is wet after the shower, and if drops fall, would that make things in the house impure? Also, since they can't wash their coat and bag, they're concerned those items might become impure. Plus, they're worried that their bed and other places they were before showering are now impure.\n\nI'm not very familiar with all the details, so I need to think about what I know. I remember that when someone is menstruating, they are in a state of impurity, which means they can't perform certain acts like prayer or fasting. But I'm not sure how that impurity affects objects they touch or use.\n\nI think that during menstruation, the woman herself is impure, but I'm not sure if that impurity transfers to objects. Maybe it's more about the blood itself. So if there's blood on something, that would make it impure, but just touching things while menstruating might not necessarily make them impure.\n\nRegarding the shower, if the intention wasn't to perform ghusl, then maybe the shower doesn't change her state. So she might still be considered impure until she performs the proper ghusl after her period ends. But I'm not certain about this.\n\nAs for the wet hair, if the water is pure, then maybe drops of water wouldn't be impure. But if the water itself is considered impure because of her state, then maybe. But I don't think that's the case. Water is generally considered pure unless it's been contaminated.\n\nThe coat and bag—since she can't wash them, maybe she can avoid using them or find a way to clean them. Or perhaps there's a way to make them pure without washing, like just sprinkling water or something.\n\nThe bed and other"}

We will summon our sons and your sons) and you summon your sons, (and our women and your women) and you summon your women, (and ourselves and yourselves, then we will pray humbly (to our Lord)) and exert our effort in praying ((and (solemnly) invoke) all together (the curse of Allah upon those who lie) about Allah concerning Jesus.", "Generated_Answer": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether women can wear makeup after performing wudu and then pray. I remember that in Islam, wudu is the act of washing specific parts of the body to prepare for prayer, and it's important to maintain that state of purity. But I'm not entirely sure how makeup factors into this.\n\nFirst, I think about what wudu entails. It involves washing the face, arms, head, and feet. If a woman wears makeup after wudu, does that invalidate her wudu? I know that wudu can be broken by things like touching the face or other parts without a barrier, but I'm not certain about makeup specifically.\n\nI also recall something about barriers. If the makeup forms a layer that prevents water from reaching the skin during wudu, that might be an issue. But if the makeup is light and doesn't create a solid barrier, maybe it's okay. So, the type of makeup could matter. Heavy makeup might block water, whereas light makeup probably doesn't.\n\nAnother point is the prayer itself. During prayer, you have to prostrate, which involves placing your face on the ground. If the makeup is such that it might come off or get in the way, that could be problematic. But I don't think that's a major issue unless it's really excessive.\n\nI also wonder about the intention behind wearing makeup. If it's for beautification for her husband, that's considered positive in Islam. But if it's for showing off in public, that might be frowned upon. However, the question is specifically about praying after wudu with makeup, so maybe the intention isn't the main concern here.\n\nI should also consider scholarly opinions. Some scholars might say that as long as the makeup doesn't prevent water from touching the skin during wudu, it's permissible. Others might be stricter. It's possible that there's a consensus that light makeup is okay, but anything too heavy is not.\n\nI remember reading somewhere that women should avoid heavy makeup during prayer times, but I'm not sure if that's a general advice or a specific rule. Maybe it's more about modesty and focus during prayer rather than the wudu itself.\n\nSo, putting it all together, I think the answer is that women can wear makeup after wudu as long as it doesn't form a barrier that prevents water from touching the skin. The makeup should be light and not obstruct the wudu process. Additionally, during prayer, the makeup shouldn't cause any issues like smudging"}
{"Question": "Q: I have come into contact with a guy at work, who had already researched a lot about Islam via the internet. So Ive explained to him that to be a Muslim he requires belief in Tawhid (Monotheism) and Risaalat (the prophethood of Nabi Sallallahu Alayhi Wasallam). I took him to the Musjid to see how we offer Salaah etc. He says he believes in Monotheism, but now hes got one question. Why could Islam unconditionally stop/forbid Alcohol, while it only regulated Slavery, and did not forbid it? I couldnt answer him, I replied by saying that it was eventually forbidden, and it was over a period of time, so that the people will willingly accept and obey, he was however not satisfied with my answer. Is there anything wrong in what I said? and please provide an answer. ? --T--", "Answer": "Forget about him. Alcohol etc. are secondary issues. There is no point in talking about secondary issues when he has not accepted the fundamental issues. Dont waste your time with such people. And Allah Taala ( ) knows best", "Document": "Narrated Aisha:(the wife of the Prophet) \"Whenever Allahs Apostle intended to go on a journey, he would draw lots amongst his wives and would take with him the one upon whom the lot fell. During a Ghazwa of his, he drew lots amongst us and the lot fell upon me, and I proceeded with him after Allah had decreed the use of the veil by women. I was carried in a Howdah (on the camel) and dismounted while still in it. When Allahs Apostle was through with his Ghazwa and returned home, and we approached the city of Medina, Allahs Apostle ordered us to proceed at night. When the order of setting off was given, I walked till I was past the army to answer the call of nature. After finishing I returned (to the camp) to depart (with the others) and suddenly realized that my necklace over my chest was missing. So, I returned to look for it and was delayed because of that. The people who used to carry me on the camel, came to my Howdah and put it on the back of the camel, thinking that I was in it, as, at that time, women were light in weight, and thin and lean, and did not use to eat much. So, those people did not feel the difference in the heaviness of the Howdah while lifting it, and they put it over the camel. At that time I was a young lady. They set the camel moving and proceeded on. I found my necklace after the army had gone, and came to their camp to find nobody. So, I went to the place where I used to stay, thinking that they would discover my absence and come back in my search. While in that state, I felt sleepy and slept. Safwan bin Muattal As-Sulami Adh-Dhakwani was behind the army and reached my abode in the morning. When he saw a sleeping person, he came to me, and he used to see me before veiling. So, I got up when I heard him saying, \"Inna lil-lah-wa inn a ilaihi rajiun (We are for Allah, and we will return to Him).\" He made his camel knell down. He got down from his camel, and put his leg on the front legs of the camel and then I rode and sat over it. Safwan set out walking, leading the camel by the rope till we reached the army who had halted to take rest at midday. Then whoever was meant for destruction, fell into destruction, (some people accused me falsely) and the leader of the false accusers was `Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul. After that we returned to Medina, and I became ill for one month while the people were spreading the forged statements of the false accusers. I was feeling during my ailment as if I were not receiving the usual kindness from the Prophet which I used to receive from him when I got sick. But he would come, greet and say, How is that (girl)? I did not know anything of what was going on till I recovered from my ailment and went out with Um Mistah to the Manasi where we used to answer the call of nature, and we used not to go to answer the call of nature except from night to night and that was before we had lavatories near to our houses. And this habit of ours was similar to the habit of the old Arabs in the open country (or away from houses). So. I and Um Mistah bint Ruhm went out walking. Um Mistah stumbled because of her long dress and on that she said, Let Mistah be ruined. I said, You are saying a bad word. Why are you abusing a man who took part in (the battle of) Badr? She said, O Hanata (you there) didnt you hear what they said? Then she told me the rumors of the false accusers. My sickness was aggravated, and when I returned home, Allahs Apostle came to me, and after greeting he said, How is that (girl)? I requested him to allow me to go to my parents. I wanted then to be sure of the news through them I Allahs Apostle allowed me, and I went to my parents and asked my mother, What are the people talking about? She said, O my daughter! Dont worry much about this matter. By Allah, never is there a charming woman loved by her husband who has other wives, but the women would forge false news about her. I said, Glorified be Allah! Are the people really taking of this matter? That night I kept on weeping and could not sleep till morning. In the morning Allahs Apostle called `Ali bin Abu Talib and Usama bin Zaid when he saw the Divine Inspiration delayed, to consul them about divorcing his wife (i.e. `Aisha). Usama bin Zaid said what he knew of the good reputation of his wives and added, O Allahs Apostle! Keep you wife, for, by Allah, we know nothing about her but good. `Ali bin Abu Talib said, O Allahs Apostle! Allah has no imposed restrictions on you, and there are many women other than she, yet you may ask the woman-servant who will tell you the truth. On that Allahs Apostle called Buraira and said, O Burair. Did you ever see anything which roused your suspicions about her? Buraira said, No, by Allah Who has sent you with the Truth, I have never seen in her anything faulty except that she is a girl of immature age, who sometimes sleeps and leaves the dough for the goats to eat. On that day Allahs Apostle ascended the pulpit and requested that somebody support him in punishing `Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul. Allahs Apostle said, Who will support me to punish that person (`Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul) who has hurt me by slandering the reputation of my family? By Allah, I know nothing about my family but good, and they have accused a person about whom I know nothing except good, and he never entered my house except in my company. Sa`d bin Mu`adh got up and said, O Allahs Apostle! by Allah, I will relieve you from him. If that man is from the tribe of the Aus, then we will chop his head off, and if he is from our brothers, the Khazraj, then order us, and we will fulfill your order. On that Sa`d bin Ubada, the chief of the Khazraj and before this incident, he had been a pious man, got up, motivated by his zeal for his tribe and said, By Allah, you have told a lie; you cannot kill him, and you will never be able to kill him. On that Usaid bin Al-Hadir got up and said (to Sa`d bin Ubada), By Allah! you are a liar. By Allah, we will kill him; and you are a hypocrite, defending the hypocrites. On this the two tribes of Aus and Khazraj got excited and were about to fight each other, while Allahs Apostle was standing on the pulpit. He got down and quieted them till they became silent and he kept quiet. On that day I kept on weeping so much so that neither did my tears stop, nor could I sleep. In the morning my parents were with me and I had wept for two nights and a day, till I thought my liver would burst from weeping. While they were sitting with me and I was weeping, an Ansari woman asked my permission to enter, and I allowed her to come in. She sat down and started weeping with me. While we were in this state, Allahs Apostle came and sat down and he had never sat with me since the day they forged the accusation. No revelation regarding my case came to him for a month. He recited Tashah-hud (i.e. None has the right to be worshipped but Allah and Muhammad is His Apostle) and then said, O `Aisha! I have been informed such-and-such about you; if you are innocent, then Allah will soon reveal your innocence, and if you have committed a sin, then repent to Allah and ask Him to forgive you, for when a person confesses his sin and asks Allah for forgiveness, Allah accepts his repentance. When Allahs Apostle finished his speech my tears ceased completely and there remained not even a single drop of it. I requested my father to reply to Allahs Apostle on my behalf. My father said, By Allah, I do not know what to say to Allahs Apostle. I said to my mother, Talk to Allahs Apostle on my behalf. She said, By Allah, I do not know what to say to Allahs Apostle. I was a young girl and did not have much knowledge of the Quran. I said. I know, by Allah, that you have listened to what people are saying and that has been planted in your minds and you have taken it as a truth. Now, if I told you that I am innocent and Allah knows that I am innocent, you would not believe me and if I confessed to you falsely that I am guilty, and Allah knows that I am innocent you would believe me. By Allah, I dont compare my situation with you except to the situation of Josephs father (i.e. Jacob) who said, So (for me) patience is most fitting against that which you assert and it is Allah (Alone) whose help can be sought. Then I turned to the other side of my bed hoping that Allah would prove my innocence. By Allah I never thought that Allah would reveal Divine Inspiration in my case, as I considered myself too inferior to be talked of in the Holy Quran. I had hoped that Allahs Apostle might have a dream in which Allah would prove my innocence. By Allah, Allahs Apostle had not got up and nobody had left the house before the Divine Inspiration came to Allahs Apostle. So, there overtook him the same state which used to overtake him, (when he used to have, on being inspired divinely). He was sweating so much so that the drops of the sweat were dropping like pearls though it was a (cold) wintry day. When that state of Allahs Apostle was over, he was smiling and the first word he said, `Aisha! Thank Allah, for Allah has declared your innocence. My mother told me to go to Allahs Apostle . I replied, By Allah I will not go to him and will not thank but Allah. So Allah revealed: \"Verily! They who spread the slander are a gang among you . . .\" (24.11) When Allah gave the declaration of my Innocence, Abu Bakr, who used to provide for Mistah bin Uthatha for he was his relative, said, By Allah, I will never provide Mistah with anything because of what he said about Aisha. But Allah later revealed: -- \"And let not those who are good and wealthy among you swear not to help their kinsmen, those in need and those who left their homes in Allahs Cause. Let them forgive and overlook. Do you not wish that Allah should forgive you? Verily! Allah is Oft-forgiving, Most Merciful.\" (24.22) After that Abu Bakr said, Yes ! By Allah! I like that Allah should forgive me, and resumed helping Mistah whom he used to help before. Allahs Apostle also asked Zainab bint Jahsh (i.e. the Prophets wife about me saying, What do you know and what did you see? She replied, O Allahs Apostle! I refrain to claim hearing or seeing what I have not heard or seen. By Allah, I know nothing except goodness about Aisha.\" Aisha further added \"Zainab was competing with me (in her beauty and the Prophets love), yet Allah protected her (from being malicious), for she had piety.\"<D>Narrated Qatadah bin An-Numan:\"There was a household among us called Banu Ubairiq, among whom was a Bishr, a Bushair, and a Mubashshir. Bushair was a hypocrite who would recite poetry reviling the Companions of the Prophet () then he would attribute it to some of the Arabs. Then he would say: So-and-so said this and that [So-and-so said this and that]. So when the Companions of the Prophet () would hear that poetry, they would say: By Allah! No one but this filthy person said this poetry - or as the man said - and they would say: Ibn Al-Ubairiq said it.\" He said: \"They were a poor and needy household during Jahiliyyah and Islam. The only food the people of Al-Madinah had was dates and barely. When a man was able to, he would import flour from Ash-Sham which he bought and kept for himself. As for his dependants, their only food was dates and barely. So an import arrived from Ash-Sham, and my uncle Rifaah bin Zaid bought a load of it, which he put in a storage area he had, where he kept his weapons - his shield and his sword. But it was taken from him from under the house. The storage was broken into and and the food and weapons were taken. In the morning, my uncle Rifaah came to me and said: O my nephew! We were robbed during the night, our storage was broken into, and our food and weapons are gone.\" He said: \"They overheard us in the house, and questioned us, and someone said to us, We saw Banu Ubairiq cooking during the night, and it looked like they had some of your food.\" He said: \"Banu Ubairiq were saying - while we were questioning them amidst their dwellings - By Allah! We do not think the one you are looking for is other than Labid bin Sahl, a man among us who is righteous and accepted Islam. When Labid heard that, he brandished his sword and said: I stole? By Allah! You either prove this theft, or I take to you with this sword. They said: Leave us O man! You are not the one who has it. So we continued questioning in the dwellings until we had no doubt that they had taken it. So my uncle said to me: O my nephew! You should go to the Messenger of Allah () and tell him about that.\" Qatadah said: \"So I went to the Messenger of Allah () and said: A family among us are ill-mannered, and they conspired against my uncle Rifaah bin aid. They broken into his storage and took his weapons and his food. We want them to return our weapons, but we have no need for the food. So the Prophet () said: I will decide about that. So when Banu Ubairiq heard about that, they brought a man from among them named Usair bin Urwah to talk to him about that, and some people form their houses gathered and said: O Messenger of Allah! Qatadah bin An-Numan and his uncle came came to a family among us who are a people of Islam and righteousness, accusing them of stealing without proof or confirmation.\" Qatadah said: \"I went to the Messenger of Allah () and spoke to him, and he said: You went to a family among them known for their Islam and righteousness, and accused them of stealing without confirmation or proof.\" He said: \"So I returned wishing that I had lost some of my wealth, and that the Messenger of Allah () had not been spoke to about that. My uncle Rifaah came to me and said: O my nephew! What did you do? So I told him what the Messenger of Allah () said to me, so he said: It is from Allah, Whom we seek help. It was not long before the Quran was revealed: Surely, We have sent down to you the Book in truth, that you might judge between men by that which Allah has shown you, so be not a pelader for the treacherous. That is Banu Ubairiq. And seek forgiveness from Allah. [That is] from what you said to Qatadah. Certainly Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful. And argue not on behalf of those who deceive themselves. Verily, Allah does not like anyone who is a betrayer, sinner. They may hide from men, but they cannot hide from Allah for He is with them up to His saying: Most Merciful. That is: If you seek Allahs forgiveness then He will forgive you. And whoever earns sin, he earns it only against himself... up to His saying: A manifest sin. Their saying about Labid; Had it not been for the grace of Allah and His Mercy upon you... up to His saying: We shall give him a great reward. (4:105-115)\" So when the Quran was revealed, the Messenger of Allah () brought the weapon and returned it to Rifaah. Qatadah said: \"When the weapon was brought to my uncle - and he was an elderly man with bad sight\" or \"an elderly weak man\" - Abu Eisa was in doubt - \"in Jahiliyyah, and I thought that he merely had entered into Islam (without real sincerity) but when I brought it to him, he said: O my nephew! It is for Allahs cause. So I knew that his Islam was genuine. When the Quran was revealed, Bushair went with the idolaters, staying with Sulafah bint Sad bin Sumayyah. So Allah, Most High, revealed: Whoever contradicts and opposes the Messenger after the right path has been shown clearly to him, and follows other than the believers way, We shall keep him in the path he has chosen, and burn him in Hell - what an evil destination. Verily Allah forgives not associating others with Him, but He forgives what is less than that for whomever He wills. And whoever associates others with Allah, then he has indeed strayed away (4:115-116). \"When he went to stay with Sulafah, Hassan bin Thabit lampooned her with verses of poetry. So she took his saddle, put it on her head, then she left with it to cast into the valley. Then she said: You gave me the poetry of Hassan - you did not bring me any good.\"<D>Narrated Ibn `Abbas:When Abu Dhar received the news of the Advent of the Prophet he said to his brother, \"Ride to this valley (of Mecca) and try to find out the truth of the person who claims to be a prophet who is informed of the news of Heaven. Listen to what he says and come back to me.\" So his brother set out and came to the Prophet and listened to some of his talks, and returned to Abu Dhar and said to him. \"I have seen him enjoining virtuous behavior and saying something that is not poetry.\" Abu Dhar said, \"You have not satisfied me as to what I wanted.\" He then took his journey-food and carried a waterskin of his, containing some water till be reached Mecca. He went to the Mosque and searched for the Prophet and though he did not know him, he hated to ask anybody about him. When a part of the night had passed away, `Ali saw him and knew that he was a stranger. So when Abu Dhar saw `Ali, he followed him, and none of them asked his companion about anything, and when it was dawn, Abu Dhar took his journey food and his water-skin to the Mosque and stayed there all the day long without being perceived by the Prophet, and when it was evening, he came back to his retiring place. `Ali passed by him and said, \"Has the man not known his dwelling place yet?\" So `Ali awakened him and took him with him and none of them spoke to the other about anything. When it was the third day. `Ali did the same and Abu Dhar stayed with him. Then `Ali said \"Will you tell me what has brought you here?\" Abu Dhar said, \"If you give me a firm promise that you will guide me, then I will tell you.\" `Ali promised him, and he informed `Ali about the matter. `Ali said, \"It is true, and he is the Apostle of Allah. Next morning when you get up, accompany me, and if I see any danger for you, I will stop as if to pass water, but if I go on, follow me and enter the place which I will enter.\" Abu Dhar did so, and followed `Ali till he entered the place of the Prophet, and Abu Dhar went in with him, Abu Dhar listened to some of the Prophets talks and embraced Islam on the spot. The Prophet said to him, \"Go back to your people and inform them (about it) till you receive my order.\" Abu Dhar said, \"By Him in Whose Hand my life is, I will proclaim my conversion loudly amongst them (i.e. the pagans).\" So he went out, and when he reached the Mosque, he said as loudly as possible, \"I bear witness that None has the right to be worshipped except Allah, and Muhammad is the Apostle of Allah.\" The People got up and beat him painfully. Then Al-Abbas came and knelt over him ((to protect him) and said (to the people), \"Woe to you! Dont you know that this man belongs to the tribe of Ghifar and your trade to Sham is through their way?\" So he rescued him from them. Abu Dhar again did the same the next day. They beat him and took vengeance on him and again Al-Abbas knelt over him (to protect him).<D>Allah then mentions the dispute of the Jews and Christians and the question which they put to the Prophet (pbuh) regarding who really follows the religion of Abraham. When the Prophet (pbuh) told them that they were both far from the Religion of Abraham, they said that they did not accept this judgement. Hence, Allah said: (Seek they) with you (other than the religion of Allah) Islam (complete surrender to Allah), (when unto Him submiteth) acknowledges Islam and Allahs divine Oneness (whosoever is in the heavens) of angels(and the earth) of believers, (willingly) the dwellers of the heavens willingly, (or unwillingly) the dwellers ofthe earth unwillingly. It is also said that this means: the sincere among the believers acknowledge this willingly while the hypocrites do so unwillingly; it is also said this means: those who are born Muslim acknowledge this willingly while those who were made to embrace Islam do so unwillingly, (and unto Him they will be returned) after death.<D>(Wait they) i.e. the people of Mecca, (indeed, for nothing less than that the angels should come unto them) to take their souls away at the moment of death, (or thy Lord should come) on the Day of Judgement, and His coming is without modality, (or there should come one of the portents from thy Lord) i.e. the rising of the sun from the West? (In the day when one of the portents from they Lord cometh) before the rising of the sun from the West, (its belief availeth naught a soul which theretofore) before the rising of the sun from the West (believed not, nor in its belief earned good) nor was it sincere in its belief, nor doing any good works before the rising of the sun from the West. This is because no faith, works or repentance areaccepted from an unbeliever who embraces Islam upon seeing the sun rise from the West, unless thatperson is young at that time or is born after. In such a case, if he leaves Islam after the sun rises from the West and then returns to Islam, his repentance is accepted. Likewise, the repentance of a sinning believer who repents of his sins after the sun rises from the West is accepted. (Say) O Muhammad to the people of Mecca: (Wait you) the Day of Judgement! (Lo! We (too) are waiting) for your punishment on the Day of Judgement or before the Day of Judgement; it is also said that this means: Say, O Muhammad, wait for my destruction, I am also waiting for yours.<D>(And a generation hath succeeded them) a generation of people succeeded the righteous ones, but their successors, among the Jews, were evil (who inherited the Scriptures) they took the Scripture and concealed the traits and description of Muhammad (pbuh) that is in it. (They grasp the goods of this low life (as the price of evil doing)) they take bribes and other unlawful stuff of this world in exchange for concealing the traits and description of Muhammad (pbuh) (and say: It will be forgiven us) the sins we commit at night shall be forgiven during the day, and the sins we commit in the day shall be forgiven at night. (And if there came to them (again)) today (the offer of the like) similar to the unlawful that had come to them before, (they would accept it) and declaring to be lawful. (Hath not the covenant of the Scripture been taken on their behalf that they should not speak aught concerning Allah save the Truth? And they have studied that which is therein) of the traits and attributes of Muhammad (pbuh); it is also said that this means: they studied what is in it of the lawful and the unlawful but did not act upon it. (And the abode of the Hereafter) i.e. Paradise (is better, for those who ward off (evil)) ward off disbelief, idolatry, indecencies, bribery and changing the traits and description of the Prophet (pbuh) in the Torah. Warding off these is better than the abode of the life of this world. (Have ye then no sense?) do you not realise that the life of this world is vanishing and the Hereafter is everlasting?", "Generated_Answer": "<think>\nOkay, so I have this question from a friend who's been talking to a guy at work about Islam. The guy has already done a lot of research online and is curious about converting. My friend explained the basics of Tawhid and Risaalat, took him to the mosque to see the prayers, and the guy believes in monotheism. But he has this one question that's holding him back: why does Islam completely forbid alcohol but only regulate slavery instead of banning it outright?\n\nMy friend tried to answer by saying that Islam eventually forbade slavery over time, doing it gradually so people would accept it willingly. But the guy wasn't satisfied with that. So, my friend is asking if there's anything wrong with what he said and wants a better answer.\n\nAlright, first, I need to understand why Islam prohibits alcohol completely but didn't outright ban slavery. I remember that in the Quran, there are verses about both issues. Let me think about the timeline of when these rulings were revealed.\n\nFor alcohol, I recall that the Quran prohibits it in stages. Initially, there were questions about prayer and intoxication, then it was discouraged, and finally, it was completely forbidden. So, it was a gradual process. That makes sense because people were used to drinking, and stopping cold turkey might have been harder.\n\nNow, regarding slavery. In Islamic history, slavery was a common practice. Islam didn't outright ban it, but it introduced regulations that made it easier for slaves to gain freedom. For example, freeing a slave was considered an act of charity, and there were specific instances where slaves could be freed, like as a form of expiration for certain sins.\n\nI think the key difference is that alcohol was seen as inherently harmful without any redeeming value, so it was completely prohibited. On the other hand, slavery was part of the existing social structure, so Islam aimed to improve the treatment of slaves and provide ways for them to become free, eventually leading to its decline.\n\nBut I'm not sure if this is entirely accurate. Maybe there's more to it. Let me think about the broader context. Islam came into a world where slavery was deeply ingrained. By regulating it, Islam set the groundwork for its eventual abolition. Over time, as societies developed, the practices aligned more with Islamic teachings, leading to the end of slavery.\n\nSo, in summary, Islam addressed both issues but in different ways. Alcohol was prohibited outright because of its direct harm, while slavery was reformed through regulations that encouraged its abolition over time."}

Hmm, I need to figure this out. Let me start by recalling what I know about Islamic practices and Salaah.\n\nFirst, Salaah is one of the five pillars of Islam, so it's really important. When performing Salaah, especially in a Masjid (mosque), there are certain etiquettes and rules to follow. One of the key things is maintaining cleanliness and purity, both physically and in the surroundings.\n\nI remember that before Salaah, one must ensure they are in a state of Wudu (ablution). This involves washing certain parts of the body to be pure for prayer. But the question here is about using deodorants or perfumes. I think this relates more to personal hygiene and the scent in the prayer area.\n\nI think using deodorant is a good hygiene practice. It helps prevent body odor, which could be distracting or unpleasant for others praying nearby. But I'm not sure if there's any specific ruling about it. Maybe it's allowed as long as it doesn't have any impermissible ingredients, like alcohol. Wait, but some deodorants do contain alcohol. Is that a problem?\n\nThen there's perfume. I recall that the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) used perfume and encouraged others to do so, especially on Fridays for Jumu'ah prayer. However, I also remember something about not using perfume that might be overpowering or distracting to others in the mosque. Maybe it's about not using too much or strong scents that could bother people nearby.\n\nWait, but I think there's a Hadith where the Prophet told a man not to come to the mosque after eating garlic because of the strong smell. So, maybe the idea is to avoid strong odors that could disturb others, whether it's from food or perfume. So, using a little perfume might be okay, but using a lot could be frowned upon.\n\nAlso, considering the mosque is a place where people gather to pray and concentrate, it's important to be mindful of others. So, using a moderate amount of perfume or deodorant that doesn't cause distraction would be permissible. But if someone uses a lot and it's overpowering, that might not be appropriate.\n\nI should also consider the ingredients. Some perfumes and deodorants might contain alcohol or other prohibited substances. If the product is Halal, then it's okay. But if it contains Haram"}

The latter is called a Bahirah. The latters milk and benefits were for men only, to the exclusion of women, and when she died both men and women could share her meat. As for the Saibah, people used to give whatever they were willing to give of cattle and hand it over to the custodians of idols. The latter would offer it to travellers who passed by, the men not the women. The animals offered were also male and never female. When thesedied both men and women shared its meat. As for the Wasilah, when a sheep had delivered seven times, they used to check the seventh birth. If it were male, they used to immolate it and its meat was shared by men and women. If it were female, women would not be allowed to benefit from it until the animal died. When the animal died, both men and women shared its meat. If it were a twin delivery, male and female, both were spared for the benefit of men only, until their death. When the animal died, both men and women shared their meat. As for the Ham, it is the male camel whose offspring has produced its own offspring, it is said that such an animal has protected its back. This animal is left alone: it is not used forriding or transporting things. It cannot be stopped from drinking of any water or grazing in any pasture, norcan it be stopped from copulating with any she-camel that comes its way.

The user used an alcohol-based sanitizer without knowing and now is worried about it. I need to figure this out.\n\nFirst, I should recall what halal and haram mean. Halal is permissible, and haram is forbidden in Islam. So, the question is about the permissibility of using alcohol-based hand sanitizers.\n\nI remember that alcohol, specifically ethanol, is considered haram when consumed because it's intoxicating. But what about using it on the skin? I think the scholars have different opinions on this. Some might say that since it's not being ingested, it's permissible for external use, like in medicine or sanitizers. Others might argue that any alcohol is haram regardless of use.\n\nI should check some reliable sources or fatwas on this. From what I know, many Islamic scholars allow the use of alcohol-based hand sanitizers when soap and water aren't available. They consider the necessity of hygiene and the intention behind using it, which is to maintain health and prevent illness.\n\nSo, if the user used it unknowingly, they didn't intend to do something wrong. In Islam, there's a principle that actions are judged by their intentions. Since they didn't know, it's not considered a sin.\n\nBut what should they do now? I think they should just continue their daily prayers and routines. Maybe they can perform wudu again if they're concerned, but it's not strictly necessary unless they feel it's a sin. They should also try to avoid using such products in the future if they can find non-alcohol-based alternatives.\n\nI should make sure to present this in a clear way, citing scholarly opinions and reassuring the user that their action was not sinful, especially since it was unintentional.\n</think>\n\nHand sanitizers that contain alcohol are generally considered permissible (halal) for use in Islam, especially when water and soap are not available. This is based on the principle that necessity makes prohibited things permissible. Many Islamic scholars agree that using alcohol-based hand sanitizers for hygiene and health purposes is acceptable, as the intention is to maintain cleanliness and prevent illness, not to consume or intoxicate.\n\nSince you used the hand sanitizer unintentionally and without knowledge, it is not considered a sin. You can continue with your prayers and daily activities as usual. However, if you are uncomfortable, you can perform wudu (ablution) again. For future use, you might consider using non"}

The following is a chart prepared by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA): Alcohol Burn-off Chart Preparation MethodPercent Retained alcohol added to boiling liquid & removed from heat 85% alcohol flamed 75% no heat, stored overnight 70% baked, 25 minutes, alcohol not stirred into mixture 45% Baked/simmered dishes with alcohol stirred into mixture: 15 minutes cooking time 40% 30 minutes cooking time 35% 1 hour cooking time 25% 1.5 hours cooking time 20% 2 hours cooking time 10% 2.5 hours cooking time 5% (http://homecooking.about.com/library/archive/blalcohol12.htm) Since it is evident that at least some percentage of wine would still be retained in the food after cooking, eating the food in question would be forbidden. Jabir ibn `Abdullah (RA) reports: The Prophet (may Allahs peace and mercy be upon him) said: whatever intoxicates in a large quantity, a small quantity of it is forbidden. (Abu Dawood; similar tradition reported in Nasai) All four Sunni schools are unanimous on the prohibition of consuming wine in any quantity. As well, wine is a type of najasa (filth). With reference to wine, the classical Arabic Hanafi fiqh text Al-Hidayah states: It is filthsevere filth, similar to urine. (Al-Hidayah, Book of Drinks) As a result, the mixture would become filthy as soon as the wine is added to it. Hence, even if the wine were to evaporate after extensive boiling or cooking, it would make no difference. Deriving benefit from filth is forbidden.

I'm not entirely sure about the rules here, especially from a religious or dietary perspective, but I'll try to think it through.\n\nFirst, I know that in many religions, including Islam and some Christian traditions, consuming alcohol is prohibited. So, if a food product contains wine, that might be a problem. But the question is about whether boiling it for a long time makes it okay because the alcohol evaporates.\n\nI remember that when you cook with alcohol, like wine or beer, a significant amount of the alcohol can evaporate, especially if it's cooked for a long time. But does all of it evaporate? I think it depends on the cooking method and the duration. For example, if you simmer something for 15 minutes, a lot of the alcohol might be gone, but maybe not all. If you boil it for a really long time, like an hour or more, perhaps more of the alcohol evaporates.\n\nBut wait, I also heard that even after cooking, some alcohol might remain. So, if the food still contains even a tiny amount of alcohol, would that still be prohibited? I'm not sure. It might depend on the specific religious guidelines. For example, in Islam, even a small amount of alcohol might make the food impermissible. But I'm not certain about that.\n\nOn the other hand, I think some traditions might allow it if the alcohol has been completely removed or significantly reduced. But how can you be sure? Maybe it's about intention as well. If the purpose is to remove the alcohol, then it might be permissible. But I'm not sure if that's the case.\n\nI should also consider the difference between cooking at home and consuming pre-made foods. If someone is cooking at home and uses wine, they might have more control over how much alcohol remains. But if it's a pre-made food, it's harder to know how much alcohol is left after processing.\n\nAnother angle is the concept of transformation in food. Some traditions might consider that if the wine has been transformed through cooking, it's no longer the same substance, so it's permissible. But again, I'm not sure if that applies here.\n\nI think I need to look up some specific guidelines. Maybe in Islamic jurisprudence, there's a rule about this. I recall something about the prohibition being on the intoxicant,"}

While I was cleaning myself, my hand touched the impurity, and some of it got on my hand.

Also, I'm wondering if the water I used to clean my feet was enough to purify the slippers, especially if it didn't reach the base.\n\nMaybe I should think about the principles of purification in Islam.

During a Ghazwa of his, he drew lots amongst us and the lot fell upon me, and I proceeded with him after Allah had decreed the use of the veil by women. I was carried in a Howdah (on the camel) and dismounted while still in it. When Allahs Apostle was through with his Ghazwa and returned home, and we approached the city of Medina, Allahs Apostle ordered us to proceed at night. When the order of setting off was given, I walked till I was past the army to answer the call of nature. After finishing I returned (to the camp) to depart (with the others) and suddenly realized that my necklace over my chest was missing. So, I returned to look for it and was delayed because of that. The people who used to carry me on the camel, came to my Howdah and put it on the back of the camel, thinking that I was in it, as, at that time, women were light in weight, and thin and lean, and did not use to eat much. So, those people did not feel the difference in the heaviness of the Howdah while lifting it, and they put it over the camel. At that time I was a young lady. They set the camel moving and proceeded on. I found my necklace after the army had gone, and came to their camp to find nobody. So, I went to the place where I used to stay, thinking that they would discover my absence and come back in my search. While in that state, I felt sleepy and slept. Safwan bin Muattal As-Sulami Adh-Dhakwani was behind the army and reached my abode in the morning. When he saw a sleeping person, he came to me, and he used to see me before veiling. So, I got up when I heard him saying, \"Inna lil-lah-wa inn a ilaihi rajiun (We are for Allah, and we will return to Him).\" He made his camel knell down. He got down from his camel, and put his leg on the front legs of the camel and then I rode and sat over it. Safwan set out walking, leading the camel by the rope till we reached the army who had halted to take rest at midday. Then whoever was meant for destruction, fell into destruction, (some people accused me falsely) and the leader of the false accusers was `Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul. After that we returned to Medina, and I became ill for one month while the people were spreading the forged statements of the false accusers. I was feeling during my ailment as if I were not receiving the usual kindness from the Prophet which I used to receive from him when I got sick. But he would come, greet and say, How is that (girl)? I did not know anything of what was going on till I recovered from my ailment and went out with Um Mistah to the Manasi where we used to answer the call of nature, and we used not to go to answer the call of nature except from night to night and that was before we had lavatories near to our houses. And this habit of ours was similar to the habit of the old Arabs in the open country (or away from houses). So. I and Um Mistah bint Ruhm went out walking. Um Mistah stumbled because of her long dress and on that she said, Let Mistah be ruined. I said, You are saying a bad word. Why are you abusing a man who took part in (the battle of) Badr? She said, O Hanata (you there) didnt you hear what they said? Then she told me the rumors of the false accusers. My sickness was aggravated, and when I returned home, Allahs Apostle came to me, and after greeting he said, How is that (girl)? I requested him to allow me to go to my parents. I wanted then to be sure of the news through them I Allahs Apostle allowed me, and I went to my parents and asked my mother, What are the people talking about? She said, O my daughter! Dont worry much about this matter. By Allah, never is there a charming woman loved by her husband who has other wives, but the women would forge false news about her. I said, Glorified be Allah! Are the people really taking of this matter? That night I kept on weeping and could not sleep till morning. In the morning Allahs Apostle called `Ali bin Abu Talib and Usama bin Zaid when he saw the Divine Inspiration delayed, to consul them about divorcing his wife (i.e. `Aisha). Usama bin Zaid said what he knew of the good reputation of his wives and added, O Allahs Apostle! Keep you wife, for, by Allah, we know nothing about her but good. `Ali bin Abu Talib said, O Allahs Apostle! Allah has no imposed restrictions on you, and there are many women other than she, yet you may ask the woman-servant who will tell you the truth. On that Allahs Apostle called Buraira and said, O Burair. Did you ever see anything which roused your suspicions about her? Buraira said, No, by Allah Who has sent you with the Truth, I have never seen in her anything faulty except that she is a girl of immature age, who sometimes sleeps and leaves the dough for the goats to eat. On that day Allahs Apostle ascended the pulpit and requested that somebody support him in punishing `Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul. Allahs Apostle said, Who will support me to punish that person (`Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul) who has hurt me by slandering the reputation of my family? By Allah, I know nothing about my family but good, and they have accused a person about whom I know nothing except good, and he never entered my house except in my company. Sa`d bin Mu`adh got up and said, O Allahs Apostle! by Allah, I will relieve you from him. If that man is from the tribe of the Aus, then we will chop his head off, and if he is from our brothers, the Khazraj, then order us, and we will fulfill your order. On that Sa`d bin Ubada, the chief of the Khazraj and before this incident, he had been a pious man, got up, motivated by his zeal for his tribe and said, By Allah, you have told a lie; you cannot kill him, and you will never be able to kill him. On that Usaid bin Al-Hadir got up and said (to Sa`d bin Ubada), By Allah! you are a liar. By Allah, we will kill him; and you are a hypocrite, defending the hypocrites. On this the two tribes of Aus and Khazraj got excited and were about to fight each other, while Allahs Apostle was standing on the pulpit. He got down and quieted them till they became silent and he kept quiet. On that day I kept on weeping so much so that neither did my tears stop, nor could I sleep. In the morning my parents were with me and I had wept for two nights and a day, till I thought my liver would burst from weeping. While they were sitting with me and I was weeping, an Ansari woman asked my permission to enter, and I allowed her to come in. She sat down and started weeping with me. While we were in this state, Allahs Apostle came and sat down and he had never sat with me since the day they forged the accusation. No revelation regarding my case came to him for a month. He recited Tashah-hud (i.e. None has the right to be worshipped but Allah and Muhammad is His Apostle) and then said, O `Aisha! I have been informed such-and-such about you; if you are innocent, then Allah will soon reveal your innocence, and if you have committed a sin, then repent to Allah and ask Him to forgive you, for when a person confesses his sin and asks Allah for forgiveness, Allah accepts his repentance. When Allahs Apostle finished his speech my tears ceased completely and there remained not even a single drop of it. I requested my father to reply to Allahs Apostle on my behalf. My father said, By Allah, I do not know what to say to Allahs Apostle. I said to my mother, Talk to Allahs Apostle on my behalf. She said, By Allah, I do not know what to say to Allahs Apostle.

I know, by Allah, that you have listened to what people are saying and that has been planted in your minds and you have taken it as a truth. Now, if I told you that I am innocent and Allah knows that I am innocent, you would not believe me and if I confessed to you falsely that I am guilty, and Allah knows that I am innocent you would believe me. By Allah, I dont compare my situation with you except to the situation of Josephs father (i.e. Jacob) who said, So (for me) patience is most fitting against that which you assert and it is Allah (Alone) whose help can be sought. Then I turned to the other side of my bed hoping that Allah would prove my innocence. By Allah I never thought that Allah would reveal Divine Inspiration in my case, as I considered myself too inferior to be talked of in the Holy Quran. I had hoped that Allahs Apostle might have a dream in which Allah would prove my innocence. By Allah, Allahs Apostle had not got up and nobody had left the house before the Divine Inspiration came to Allahs Apostle. So, there overtook him the same state which used to overtake him, (when he used to have, on being inspired divinely). He was sweating so much so that the drops of the sweat were dropping like pearls though it was a (cold) wintry day. When that state of Allahs Apostle was over, he was smiling and the first word he said, `Aisha! Thank Allah, for Allah has declared your innocence. My mother told me to go to Allahs Apostle . I replied, By Allah I will not go to him and will not thank but Allah. So Allah revealed: \"Verily! They who spread the slander are a gang among you . . .\" (24.11) When Allah gave the declaration of my Innocence, Abu Bakr, who used to provide for Mistah bin Uthatha for he was his relative, said, By Allah, I will never provide Mistah with anything because of what he said about Aisha. But Allah later revealed: -- \"And let not those who are good and wealthy among you swear not to help their kinsmen, those in need and those who left their homes in Allahs Cause. Let them forgive and overlook. Do you not wish that Allah should forgive you? Verily! Allah is Oft-forgiving, Most Merciful.\" (24.22) After that Abu Bakr said, Yes ! By Allah! I like that Allah should forgive me, and resumed helping Mistah whom he used to help before. Allahs Apostle also asked Zainab bint Jahsh (i.e. the Prophets wife about me saying, What do you know and what did you see? She replied, O Allahs Apostle! I refrain to claim hearing or seeing what I have not heard or seen. By Allah, I know nothing except goodness about Aisha.\" Aisha further added \"Zainab was competing with me (in her beauty and the Prophets love), yet Allah protected her (from being malicious), for she had piety.\"<D>Narrated Aisha:(The wife of the Prophet) Whenever Allahs Apostle intended to go on a journey, he used to draw lots among his wives and would take with him the one on whom the lot had fallen. Once he drew lots when he wanted to carry out a Ghazwa, and the lot came upon me. So I proceeded with Allahs Apostle after Allahs order of veiling (the women) had been revealed and thus I was carried in my howdah (on a camel) and dismounted while still in it. We carried on our journey, and when Allahs Apostle had finished his Ghazwa and returned and we approached Medina, Allahs Apostle ordered to proceed at night. When the army was ordered to resume the homeward journey, I got up and walked on till I left the army (camp) behind. When I had answered the call of nature, I went towards my howdah, but behold ! A necklace of mine made of Jaz Azfar (a kind of black bead) was broken and I looked for it and my search for it detained me. The group of people who used to carry me, came and carried my howdah on to the back of my camel on which I was riding, considering that I was therein. At that time women were light in weight and were not fleshy for they used to eat little (food), so those people did not feel the lightness of the howdah while raising it up, and I was still a young lady. They drove away the camel and proceeded. Then I found my necklace after the army had gone. I came to their camp but found nobody therein so I went to the place where I used to stay, thinking that they would miss me and come back in my search. While I was sitting at my place, I felt sleepy and slept. Safwan bin Al-Muattil As-Sulami Adh- Dhakw-ani was behind the army. He had started in the last part of the night and reached my stationing place in the morning and saw the figure of a sleeping person. He came to me and recognized me on seeing me for he used to see me before veiling. I got up because of his saying: \"Inna Li l-lahi wa inna ilaihi rajiun,\" which he uttered on recognizing me. I covered my face with my garment, and by Allah, he did not say to me a single word except, \"Inna Li l-lahi wa inna ilaihi rajiun,\" till he made his shecamel kneel down whereupon he trod on its forelegs and I mounted it. Then Safwan set out, leading the she-camel that was carrying me, till we met the army while they were resting during the hot midday. Then whoever was meant for destruction, fell in destruction, and the leader of the Ifk (forged statement) was `Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul. After this we arrived at Medina and I became ill for one month while the people were spreading the forged statements of the people of the Ifk, and I was not aware of anything thereof. But what aroused my doubt while I was sick, was that I was no longer receiving from Allahs Apostle the same kindness as I used to receive when I fell sick. Allahs Apostle would enter upon me, say a greeting and add, \"How is that (lady)?\" and then depart. That aroused my suspicion but I was not aware of the propagated evil till I recovered from my ailment. I went out with Um Mistah to answer the call of nature towards Al-Manasi, the place where we used to relieve ourselves, and used not to go out for this purpose except from night to night, and that was before we had lavatories close to our houses. And this habit of ours was similar to the habit of the old Arabs (in the deserts or in the tents) concerning the evacuation of the bowels, for we considered it troublesome and harmful to take lavatories in the houses. So I went out with Um Mistah who was the daughter of Abi Ruhm bin `Abd Manaf, and her mother was daughter of Sakhr bin Amir who was the aunt of Abi Bakr As-Siddiq, and her son was Mistah bin Uthatha. When we had finished our affair, Um Mistah and I came back towards my house. Um Mistah stumbled over her robe whereupon she said, \"Let Mistah be ruined ! \" I said to her, \"What a bad word you have said! Do you abuse a man who has taken part in the Battle of Badr? She said, \"O you there! Didnt you hear what he has said?\" I said, \"And what did he say?\" She then told me the statement of the people of the Ifk (forged statement) which added to my ailment. When I returned home, Allahs Apostle came to me, and after greeting, he said, \"How is that (lady)?\" I said, \"Will you allow me to go to my parents?\" At that time I intended to be sure of the news through them. Allahs Apostle allowed me and I went to my parents and asked my mother, \"O my mother! What are the people talking about?\" My mother said, \"O my daughter! Take it easy, for by Allah, there is no charming lady who is loved by her husband who has other wives as well, but that those wives would find fault with her.\" I said, \"Subhan Allah! Did the people really talk about that?\" That night I kept on weeping the whole night till the morning. My tears never stopped, nor did I sleep, and morning broke while I was still weeping, Allahs Apostle called `Ali bin Abi Talib and Usama bin Zaid when the Divine Inspiration delayed, in order to consult them as to the idea of divorcing his wife. Usama bin Zaid told Allahs Apostle of what he knew about the innocence of his wife and of his affection he kept for her. He said, \"O Allahs Apostle! She is your wife, and we do not know anything about her except good.\" But `Ali bin Abi Talib said, \"O Allahs Apostle! Allah does not impose restrictions on you; and there are plenty of women other than her. If you however, ask (her) slave girl, she will tell you the truth.\" `Aisha added: So Allahs Apostle called for Barira and said, \"O Barira! Did you ever see anything which might have aroused your suspicion? (as regards Aisha). Barira said, \"By Allah Who has sent you with the truth, I have never seen anything regarding Aisha which I would blame her for except that she is a girl of immature age who sometimes sleeps and leaves the dough of her family unprotected so that the domestic goats come and eat it.\" So Allahs Apostle got up (and addressed) the people an asked for somebody who would take revenge on `Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul then. Allahs Apostle, while on the pulpit, said, \"O Muslims! Who will help me against a man who has hurt me by slandering my family? By Allah, I know nothing except good about my family, and people have blamed a man of whom I know nothing except good, and he never used to visit my family except with me,\" Sa`d bin Mu`adh Al-Ansari got up and said, \"O Allahs Apostle! By Allah, I will relieve you from him. If he be from the tribe of (Bani) Al-Aus, then I will chop his head off; and if he be from our brethren, the Khazraj, then you give us your order and we will obey it.\" On that, Sa`d bin Ubada got up, and he was the chief of the Khazraj, and before this incident he had been a pious man but he was incited by his zeal for his tribe. He said to Sa`d (bin Mu`adh), \"By Allah the Eternal, you have told a lie! You shall not kill him and you will never be able to kill him!\" On that, Usaid bin Hudair, the cousin of Sa`d (bin Mu`adh) got up and said to Sa`d bin Ubada, \"You are a liar! By Allah the Eternal, we will surely kill him; and you are a hypocrite defending the hypocrites!\" So the two tribes of Al-Aus and Al-Khazraj got excited till they were on the point of fighting with each other while Allahs Apostle was standing on the pulpit. Allahs Apostle continued quietening them till they became silent whereupon he became silent too. On that day I kept on weeping so much that neither did my tears stop, nor could I sleep. In the morning my parents were with me, and I had wept for two nights and a day without sleeping and with incessant tears till they thought that my liver would burst with weeping. While they were with me and I was weeping, an Ansari woman asked permission to see me. I admitted her and she sat and started weeping with me. While I was in that state, Allahs Apostle came to us, greeted, and sat down,. He had never sat with me since the day what was said, was said. He had stayed a month without receiving any Divine Inspiration concerning my case. Allahs Apostle recited the Tashahhud after he had sat down, and then said, \"Thereafter, O `Aisha! I have been informed such and-such a thing about you; and if you are innocent, Allah will reveal your innocence, and if you have committed a sin, then ask for Allahs forgiveness and repent to Him, for when a slave confesses his sin and then repents to Allah, Allah accepts his repentance.\" When Allahs Apostle had finished his speech, my tears ceased completely so that I no longer felt even a drop thereof. Then I said to my father, \"Reply to Allahs Apostle on my behalf as to what he said.\" He said, \"By Allah, I do not know what to say to Allahs Apostle.\" Then I said to my mother, \"Reply to Allahs Apostle.\" She said, \"I do not know what to say to Allahs Apostle.\" Still a young girl as I was and though I had little knowledge of Quran, I said, \"By Allah, I know that you heard this story (of the Ifk) so much so that it has been planted in your minds and you have believed it. So now, if I tell you that I am innocent, and Allah knows that I am innocent, you will not believe me; and if I confess something, and Allah knows that I am innocent of it, you will believe me. By Allah, I cannot find of you an example except that of Josephs father: \"So (for me) patience is most fitting against that which you assert and it is Allah (Alone) Whose help can be sought. Then I turned away and lay on my bed, and at that time I knew that I was innocent and that Allah would reveal my innocence. But by Allah, I never thought that Allah would sent down about my affair, Divine Inspiration that would be recited (forever), as I considered myself too unworthy to be talked of by Allah with something that was to be recited: but I hoped that Allahs Apostle might have a vision in which Allah would prove my innocence. By Allah, Allahs Apostle had not left his seat and nobody had left the house when the Divine Inspiration came to Allahs Apostle . So there overtook him the same hard condition which used to overtake him (when he was Divinely Inspired) so that the drops of his sweat were running down, like pearls, though it was a (cold) winter day, and that was because of the heaviness of the Statement which was revealed to him. When that state of Allahs Apostle was over, and he was smiling when he was relieved, the first word he said was, \"Aisha, Allah has declared your innocence.\" My mother said to me, \"Get up and go to him.\" I said, \"By Allah, I will not go to him and I will not thank anybody but Allah.\" So Allah revealed: \"Verily! They who spread the Slander are a gang among you. Think it not....\" (24.11-20). When Allah revealed this to confirm my innocence, Abu Bakr As-Siddiq who used to provide for Mistah bin Uthatha because of the latters kinship to him and his poverty, said, \"By Allah, I will never provide for Mistah anything after what he has said about Aisha\". So Allah revealed: (continued...) (continuing... 1): -6.274:... ... \"Let not those among you who are good and are wealthy swear not to give (help) to their kinsmen, those in need, and those who have left their homes for Allahs Cause. Let them Pardon and forgive (i.e. do not punish them). Do you not love that should forgive you? Verily Allah is Oft-forgiving. Most Merciful.\" (24.22) Abu Bakr said, \"Yes, by Allah, I wish that Allah should forgive me.\" So he resumed giving Mistah the aid he used to give him before and said, \"By Allah, I will never withold it from him at all.\" Aisha further said: Allahs Apostle also asked Zainab bint Jahsh about my case. He said, \"O Zainab! What have you seen?\" She replied, \"O Allahs Apostle! I protect my hearing and my sight (by refraining from telling lies). I know nothing but good (about Aisha).\" Of all the wives of Allahs Apostle, it was Zainab who aspired to receive from him the same favor as I used to receive, yet, Allah saved her (from telling lies) because of her piety. But her sister, Hamna, kept on fighting on her behalf so she was destroyed as were those who invented and spread the slander.<D>Narrated Ibn `Abbas:The first lady to use a girdle was the mother of Ishmael. She used a girdle so that she might hide her tracks from Sarah. Abraham brought her and her son Ishmael while she was suckling him, to a place near the Ka`ba under a tree on the spot of Zamzam, at the highest place in the mosque. During those days there was nobody in Mecca, nor was there any water So he made them sit over there and placed near them a leather bag containing some dates, and a small water-skin containing some water, and set out homeward. Ishmaels mother followed him saying, \"O Abraham! Where are you going, leaving us in this valley where there is no person whose company we may enjoy, nor is there anything (to enjoy)?\" She repeated that to him many times, but he did not look back at her Then she asked him, \"Has Allah ordered you to do so?\" He said, \"Yes.\" She said, \"Then He will not neglect us,\" and returned while Abraham proceeded onwards, and on reaching the Thaniya where they could not see him, he faced the Ka`ba, and raising both hands, invoked Allah saying the following prayers: O our Lord! I have made some of my offspring dwell in a valley without cultivation, by Your Sacred House (Ka`ba at Mecca) in order, O our Lord, that they may offer prayer perfectly. So fill some hearts among men with love towards them, and (O Allah) provide them with fruits, so that they may give thanks. (14.37) Ishmaels mother went on suckling Ishmael and drinking from the water (she had). When the water in the water-skin had all been used up, she became thirsty and her child also became thirsty. She started looking at him (i.e. Ishmael) tossing in agony; She left him, for she could not endure looking at him, and found that the mountain of Safa was the nearest mountain to her on that land. She stood on it and started looking at the valley keenly so that she might see somebody, but she could not see anybody. Then she descended from Safa and when she reached the valley, she tucked up her robe and ran in the valley like a person in distress and trouble, till she crossed the valley and reached the Marwa mountain where she stood and started looking, expecting to see somebody, but she could not see anybody. She repeated that (running between Safa and Marwa) seven times.\" The Prophet said, \"This is the source of the tradition of the walking of people between them (i.e. Safa and Marwa). When she reached the Marwa (for the last time) she heard a voice and she asked herself to be quiet and listened attentively. She heard the voice again and said, O, (whoever you may be)! You have made me hear your voice; have you got something to help me?\" And behold! She saw an angel at the place of Zamzam, digging the earth with his heel (or his wing), till water flowed from that place. She started to make something like a basin around it, using her hand in this way, and started filling her water-skin with water with her hands, and the water was flowing out after she had scooped some of it.\" The Prophet added, \"May Allah bestow Mercy on Ishmaels mother! Had she let the Zamzam (flow without trying to control it) (or had she not scooped from that water) (to fill her water-skin), Zamzam would have been a stream flowing on the surface of the earth.\" The Prophet further added, \"Then she drank (water) and suckled her child. The angel said to her, Dont be afraid of being neglected, for this is the House of Allah which will be built by this boy and his father, and Allah never neglects His people. The House (i.e. Ka`ba) at that time was on a high place resembling a hillock, and when torrents came, they flowed to its right and left. She lived in that way till some people from the tribe of Jurhum or a family from Jurhum passed by her and her child, as they (i.e. the Jurhum people) were coming through the way of Kada. They landed in the lower part of Mecca where they saw a bird that had the habit of flying around water and not leaving it. They said, This bird must be flying around water, though we know that there is no water in this valley. They sent one or two messengers who discovered the source of water, and returned to inform them of the water. So, they all came (towards the water).\" The Prophet added, \"Ishmaels mother was sitting near the water. They asked her, Do you allow us to stay with you?\" She replied, Yes, but you will have no right to possess the water. They agreed to that.\" The Prophet further said, \"Ishmaels mother was pleased with the whole situation as she used to love to enjoy the company of the people. So, they settled there, and later on they sent for their families who came and settled with them so that some families became permanent residents there. The child (i.e. Ishmael) grew up and learnt Arabic from them and (his virtues) caused them to love and admire him as he grew up, and when he reached the age of puberty they made him marry a woman from amongst them. After Ishmaels mother had died, Abraham came after Ishmaels marriage in order to see his family that he had left before, but he did not find Ishmael there. When he asked Ishmaels wife about him, she replied, He has gone in search of our livelihood. Then he asked her about their way of living and their condition, and she replied, We are living in misery; we are living in hardship and destitution, complaining to him. He said, When your husband returns, convey my salutation to him and tell him to change the threshold of the gate (of his house). When Ishmael came, he seemed to have felt something unusual, so he asked his wife, Has anyone visited you? She replied, Yes, an old man of so-and-so description came and asked me about you and I informed him, and he asked about our state of living, and I told him that we were living in a hardship and poverty. On that Ishmael said, Did he advise you anything? She replied, Yes, he told me to convey his salutation to you and to tell you to change the threshold of your gate. Ishmael said, It was my father, and he has ordered me to divorce you. Go back to your family. So, Ishmael divorced her and married another woman from amongst them (i.e. Jurhum). Then Abraham stayed away from them for a period as long as Allah wished and called on them again but did not find Ishmael. So he came to Ishmaels wife and asked her about Ishmael. She said, He has gone in search of our livelihood. Abraham asked her, How are you getting on? asking her about their sustenance and living. She replied, We are prosperous and well-off (i.e. we have everything in abundance). Then she thanked Allah Abraham said, What kind of food do you eat? She said. Meat. He said, What do you drink? She said, Water.\" He said, \"O Allah! Bless their meat and water.\" The Prophet added, \"At that time they did not have grain, and if they had grain, he would have also invoked Allah to bless it.\" The Prophet added, \"If somebody has only these two things as his sustenance, his health and disposition will be badly affected, unless he lives in Mecca.\" The Prophet added,\" Then Abraham said Ishmaels wife, \"When your husband comes, give my regards to him and tell him that he should keep firm the threshold of his gate. When Ishmael came back, he asked his wife, Did anyone call on you? She replied, Yes, a good-looking old man came to me, so she praised him and added. He asked about you, and I informed him, and he asked about our livelihood and I told him that we were in a good condition. Ishmael asked her, Did he give you any piece of advice? She said, Yes, he told me to give his regards to you and ordered that you should keep firm the threshold of your gate. On that Ishmael said, It was my father, and you are the threshold (of the gate). He has ordered me to keep you with me. Then Abraham stayed away from them for a period as long as Allah wished, and called on them afterwards. He saw Ishmael under a tree near Zamzam, sharpening his arrows. When he saw Abraham, he rose up to welcome him (and they greeted each other as a father does with his son or a son does with his father). Abraham said, O Ishmael! Allah has given me an order. Ishmael said, Do what your Lord has ordered you to do. Abraham asked, Will you help me? Ishmael said, I will help you. Abraham said, Allah has ordered me to build a house here, pointing to a hillock higher than the land surrounding it.\" The Prophet added, \"Then they raised the foundations of the House (i.e. the Ka`ba). Ishmael brought the stones and Abraham was building, and when the walls became high, Ishmael brought this stone and put it for Abraham who stood over it and carried on building, while Ishmael was handing him the stones, and both of them were saying, O our Lord! Accept (this service) from us, Verily, You are the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing. The Prophet added, \"Then both of them went on building and going round the Ka`ba saying: O our Lord ! Accept (this service) from us, Verily, You are the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing.\" (2.127)<D>Allah then went back to His saying: (Divorce must be pronounced twice) saying: (And if he hath divorced her) i.e. the third time, (then she is not lawful unto him thereafter) after the third divorce (until she hath wedded another husband) and the marriage must be consummated. (Then if he (the other husband) divorce her) this was revealed about Abd al-Rahman Ibn al-Zubayr, (it is no sin for both of them) the first husband and the woman (that they come together again) with a new dowry and marriage contract (if they consider) if they know (that they are able to observe the limits of Allah) the rulings of Allah regulating the relationship between husband and wife. (These are the limits of Allah) these are Allahs rulings andobligations. (He manifesteth them for people who have knowledge) they are from Allah and believe them tobe so. <D>(Divorce must be pronounced twice) He says: the divorce in which a man is entitled to take back his wife is pronounced once on two separate occasions (and then (a woman) must be retained) before she is pronounced divorced a third time and before performing major ritual ablution from the third menstruation (in honour) with kind companionship and intercourse (or released in kindness) or divorced a third time with such kindness as restores her rights. (And it is not lawful for you that ye take from women aught of that which ye have given them) of dowry; (except (in the case) when both arbiters) when the husband and wifeboth know that she wants to ransom her divorce (fear that they may not be able to keep the limits (imposed by) Allah) the rulings of Allah regulating the relationship between husband and wife. (And if ye fear) if you know (that they may not be able to keep the limits (imposed by) Allah) the rulings of Allah regulating the relationship between husband and wife, (in that case it is no sin for either of them) and especially the husband (if the woman ransom herself) if the husband takes what the woman ransoms herself with, out of the generosity of her soul. This verse was revealed about Thabit Ibn Qays Ibn Shammas whose wife Jamilah was the daughter of Abdullah Ibn Ubayy Ibn Salul, chief of the hypocrites. This woman ransomed her divorce from her husband by giving him back what he gave her as dowry. (These are the limits of Allah) the rulings of Allah regulating the relationship between husband and wife, (Transgress them not) do not step beyond that which Allah has prohibited. (For whoso transgresseth Allahs limits) steps beyond them: (such are wrong-doers) harmful to themselves.<D>(And the wife of Pharaoh) Asiyah Bint Muzahim, who was Moses aunt (said: (He will be)) this child will be (a consolation for me and for you) O Pharaoh. (Kill him not. Peradventure he may be of use to us) in our farm, (or we may choose him for a son) or adopt him as a son. (And they perceived not) the Children of Israel did not know that he was not from them; it is also said that this means: and they did not know that their destruction will be at his hands.", "Generated_Answer": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to help someone who's really struggling with panic attacks and a difficult marriage situation. She's reached out because she's feeling scared all the time and doesn't know why. She's been reading Surah Naas and other things, but she's still not finding relief. She also mentioned that her husband hasn't lived with her for seven years, and she wants him to be more supportive and caring. She's feeling stressed and depressed, and she's getting advice from various sources, some saying she has a \"saya\" which might be causing her panic attacks.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what she's going through. Panic attacks can be really debilitating, and feeling unsupported in a marriage can compound that stress. She's reaching out to Allah every day, which is a good foundation, but she's still struggling. She's also confused about whether to read Darood Tanjina or not, as different sources have given conflicting advice.\n\nI should consider her mental and emotional state. She's feeling isolated, both because of her husband's absence and her panic attacks. The mention of \"saya\" makes me think she might be referring to something like an evil eye or negative energy, which is a concept in some cultures where someone's envy or negative thoughts can bring harm. If she believes this is affecting her, it's important to address it in a way that's culturally sensitive and within an Islamic framework.\n\nShe needs practical steps she can take. She's already reading some Surahs, but maybe she needs more specific duas or additional steps. It's also important to encourage her to seek professional help, as mental health is crucial. However, she might be hesitant due to cultural reasons, so it's important to present it as a supplement to her spiritual practices.\n\nFor her marriage situation, she needs guidance on how to pray for her husband and their relationship. She might be feeling hopeless after seven years, so the duas should focus on reconciliation, healing, and restoring the bond between her and her husband.\n\nI should structure the response to first address her panic attacks, providing specific duas and practical steps. Then, move on to her marriage, giving her heartfelt prayers she can recite. It's also important to address the confusion about Darood Tanjina, clarifying its use and reassuring her that there's no harm in reciting it if it brings her comfort.\n\nAdditionally, she needs reassurance that her feelings are valid and that it's okay to seek help. Encouraging her to maintain a routine"}
{"Question": "Q: This evening, I was in a shop about to pay for my shopping, when a woman, who seemed to be off her head, came into the shop and began talking away incoherently with the shopkeeper and myself. She seemed to be on drugs or drunk or something. She had some shopping gathered, and about to pay for it. Amongst her shopping, she had some beer cans (alcohol). As she was talking to me, she kept on touching the back of my left hand with her index finger every now and then, so as to get me to sort of agree with her on what she was going on about, and also as a way of making a point. It was harmless, but I felt uncomfortable. But just after she had paid for her stuff, one of her beer cans fell out of her bag on the ground, and I picked it up and gave it to her. That was it. I know one shouldnt deal with alcohol in any way, but I went ahead and picked the beer can up (knowing alcohol is haram) for her and handed it to her! Is there any sin on me due to this? And what is the ruling on this sort of thing, i.e helping someone pick up their beer cans/bottles after they had dropped it on the floor? What can I do to make up for this if anything? How about the woman tapping me on the back of my hand, as a way of emphasising her, incoherent points? What should I do in this case? ? --T--", "Answer": "1. You should make tawbah for picking up the beer can and giving it to her and refrain from this in the future. 2. Allowing her to touch you was incorrect and impermissible. You should have immediately stopped her from touching you. You should make istighfaar for what has happened. And Allah Taala ( ) knows best", "Document": "Ubadah b. Walid b. Samit reported:I and my father set out in search of knowledge to a tribe of the Ansar before their death (i. e. before the Companions of the Holy Prophet left the world) and I was the first to meet Abu Yasar, a Companion of Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) and there was a young man with him who carried the record of letters with him and there was a mantle prepared by the tribe of Maafiri upon him. And his servant too had a Maafiri mantle over him. My father said to him: My uncle, I see the signs of anger or that of agony on your face. He said: Yes, such and such person, the son of so and so, of the tribe of Harami owed me a debt. I went to his family, extended salutations and said: Where is he? They said: He is not here. Then came out to me his son who was at the threshold of his youth. I said to him: Where is your father? He said: No sooner did he hear your sound than he hid himself behind my mothers bedstead. I said to him: Walk out to me, for I know where you are. He came out. I said to him: What prompted you to hide yourself from me? He said: By God, whatever I would say to you would not be a lie. By Allah, I fear that I should tell a lie to you and in case of making promise with you I should break it, as you are the Companion of Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him). The fact is that I was hard up in regard to money. I said: Do you adjure by Allah? He said: I adjure by Allah. I said: Do you adjure by Allah? He said: I adjure by Allah. I said: Do you adjure by Allah? He said: I adjure by Allah. Then he brought his promissory note and he wrote off (the debt) with his hand and said: Make payment when you find yourself solvent enough to pay me back; if you are not, then there is no liability upon you. These two eyes of mine saw, and he (AbuI-Yasar) placed his fingers upon his eyes and these two ears of mine heard and my heart retained, and he pointed towards his heart that Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: He who gives time to one who is financially hard up (in the payment of debt) or writes off his debt, Allah will provide him His shadow. I said to him: My uncle, if you get the cloak of your servant and you give him your two clothes, or take his two clothes of Maafir and give him your cloak, then there would be one dress for you and one for him. He wiped my head and said: O Allah, bless the son of my brother. O, son of my brother, these two very eyes of mine saw and these two ears of mine listened to and this heart of mine retained this, and he pointed towards the heart that Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: Feed them (the servants) and clothe them (the servants) what you wear, and if I give him the goods of the world, it is easy for me than this that he should take my virtues on the Day of Resurrection. We went on till we came to Jabir b. Abdullah in the mosque and he was busy in observing prayer in one cloth which he had joined at its opposite ends. I made my way through the people till I sat between him and the Qibla and I said: May Allah have mercy upon you. Do you observe prayer with one cloth on your body whereas your mantle is lying at your side? He pointed me with his hand towards my breast just like this and he separated his fingers and bent them in the shape of a bow. And (he said): I thought that a fool like you should come to me so that he should see me as I do and he should then also do like it. Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) came to us in this very mosque and he had in his hand the twig of the palm-tree and he saw mucus towards the Qibla of the mosque and he erased it with the help of the twig. He then came to us and said: Who amongst you likes that Allah should turn His face away from him? We were afraid. He then again said: Who amongst you likes that Allah should turn His face away from him? We were afraid. He again said: Who amongst you likes that Allah should turn His face away from him? We said: Allahs Messenger, none of us likes it. And he said: If one amongst you stands for prayer, Allah, the Exalted and Glorious, is before him he should not spit in front of him, or on his right side, but should spit on his left side beneath his left foot and if he is impelled to do so all of a sudden (in spite of himself) he should then spit in his cloth and fold it in some part of it. (and he further said: ) Bring some sweet-smelling thing. A young man who belonged to our tribe stood up, went and brought scent in his palm. Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) took that and applied it to the end of that twig and then touched the place where there had been mucus. Jabir said: This is why you should apply scent to your mosques. It is reported on the same authority: We set out along with Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) on an expedition of Batn Buwat. He (the Holy Prophet) was in search of al-Majdi b. Amr al-Juhani. (We had so meagre equipment) that five. six or seven of us had one camel to ride and so we mounted it turn by turn. Once there wan. the turn of an Ansari to ride upon the camel. He made it kneel down to ride over it (and after having. mounted it), he tried to raise it up but it hesitated. So he said. May there be curse of Allah upon you! Thereupon Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: Who is there to curse his camel? He said: Allahs Messenger, it is I. Thereupon he said: Get down from the camel and let us not have in our company the cursed one. Dont curse your own selves, nor your children. nor your belongings. There is the possibility that your curse may synchronies with the time when Allah is about to confer upon you what you demand and thus your prayer may be readily responded. It is reported on the same authority: We set out on an expedition along with Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) until it was evening, and we had been near a. water reservoir of Arabia. Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: Who would be the person who would go ahead and set right the reservoir and drink water himself and serve us with it? Jabir said: I stood up and said: Allahs Messenger, it is I who am ready to do that. Thereupon Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: Who is the person to accompany Jabir? And then Jabbar b. Sakhr stood up. So we went to that well and poured in that tank a bucket or two of water and plastered it with clay and then began to fill it (with water) until it was filled to the brim. Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) was the first who appeared before us, and he said: Do you (both) permit me to drink water out of it? We said: Yea, Allahs Messenger. He led his camel to drink water and it drank. He then pulled its rein and it stretched its legs and began to urinate. He then took it aside and made it kneel down at another place and then came to the tank and performed ablution. I then got up and performed ablution like the ablution of Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him), and Jabbar b. Sakhr went in order to relieve himself and Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) got up to observe prayer and there was a mantle over me. I tried to invert its ends but it was too short (to cover my body easily). It had its borders. I then inverted it (the mantle) and drew its opposite ends and then tied them at my neck. I then came and stood upon the left side of Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him). He caught hold of me and made me go round behind him, until he made me stand on his right side. Then Jabbar b. Sakhr came. He performed ablution and then came and stood on the left side of Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him). Then Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) caught hold of our hands together, pushed us back and made us stand behind him. Then Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) began to look upon me with darting looks, but I did not perceive that. After that I became aware of it and he pointed with the gesture of his hand that I should wrap my loin-cloth. When Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) had finished the prayer, he said: Jabir! I said: Allahs Messenger, at thy beck and call. He said: When the cloth around you is inadequate, then tie the opposite ends but when it is small, tie it over the lower body. Jabir reported: We set out on an expedition with Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) and the only means of sustenance for every person amongst us was only one date for a day and we used to chew it. And we struck the leaves with the help of our bow and ate them until the sides of our mouths were injured. It so happened one day that a person was overlooked and not given a date. We carried that person and bore witness to the fact that he had not been given that date so he was offered that and he got up and received that. Jabir reported: We set out on an expedition along with Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) until we got down at a spacious valley and Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) went to relieve himself. I followed him with a bucket full of water and Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) looked about and he found no privacy but two trees at the end of the valley and Allahs Messenger (may. peace be upon him) went to one of them and took hold of one of its twigs and said: Be thou under my control by the permission of Allah, and so it came under his control like the camel who has its nosestring in the hand of its rider, and then he came to the second tree and took hold of a twig and said: Be thou under my control with the permission of Allah, and it came under his control, and when he came in the middle of the two trees he joined together the two twigs and said: join with the permission of Allah. Jabir said: I was afraid lest Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) should be aware of my nearness and go still farther. And Muhammad b. Abbad has used the word\" faitabd\" and I began to talk to myself. And as I saw, I suddenly found Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) before me and the two trees were separated and each one of them was standing at its place. I saw Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) standing for a short time, nodding his head towards right and left. Ismail pointed towards the right and left with the help of his head (in order to demonstrate how the Holy Prophet had pointed). Then he (the Holy Prophet) came to me and said: Jabir did you see my place where I was standing? I said: Allahs Messenger, yes. He then said: Then you should go to those two trees and cut a twig from each of them and go to that place with them where I was standing and stand there where I was standing and place a twig on the right and a twig on the left. Jabir said: I set out and took hold of a stone and broke it and sharpened it and then I came to those trees and cut a twig from each one of them. I then came dragging them until I stood at the place where Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) had been standing and placed a twig on the right and a twig on the left. Then I met him and said: Allahs Messenger, I have done that, but (kindly) explain to me the reason for it. Thereupon he said: I passed by two graves the occupants of which had been undergoing torment. I liked to make intercession for them so that the might be relieved of this torment y as long as these twigs remain fresh. Jabir said: We came back to the (camp of the) army and Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: Jabir, call people for per- forming wudu. I cried: Come and perform wudu, come and perform wudu, come and perform wudu. I said: Allahs Messenger, there is not even a drop of water in the army camp, and there. was a person who used to cool the water for Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) in the old water-skin which kept hanging by the twig. He asked me to go to such and such Ansari and ask him to see if there was any water in that skin. I went to him and cast a glance in it but did not find anything but a drop in the mouth of that water-skin and if I were to draw that, the water-skins,. dried part would suck it up. I came to Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) and said: Allahs Messenger, I have not found anything in it but a drop of water in the mouth of the water-skin and now if I were to draw that, it would be absorbed. He said: Go and bring that to me. I brought that to him. He took hold of it -and began to utter something which I could not understand and then pressed it with his hand and gave that to me and said: Jabir, announce for the tub to be brought. So I announced that the tub of the army (be brought). It was brought accordingly and I placed it before him (the Holy Prophet). Thereupon Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) placed his hands in the tub like this: with his fingers stretched out, and then he placed his fingers at the bottom of the tub and said: Jabir, take it (that waters-skin) and pour water over me, by reciting Bismillah, and I poured water and I said: Bismillah, and found water sprouting out between the fingers of Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him). Then that tub gushed forth until it was filled up and the Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: Jabir, make an announcement to the effect: He who needs water should take that. Jabir said: The people came and got water until they were all satiated. I said: Is there anyone left who wants to get it? And Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) then lifted up his hand from that tub and it was still full. Then the people made a complaint to Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) about hunger and he said: May Allah provide you food! We came to the bank of the ocean and the ocean was tossing and it threw out a big animal and we lit fire and cooked it and took it until we had eaten to our hearts content. Jabir said: I and such and such five persons entered Its socket and nobody could see us until we had come out, and we took hold of one of its ribs and twisted it into a sort of arch, then we called the tallest of the persons of the army and the hugest of the camels of the army and it had the big saddle over it, and it could easily pass through it without the rider having need to bend down.<D>Musab b. Sad reported on the authority of his father that many verses of the Quran had been revealed in connection with him. His mother Umm Sad had taken oath that she would never talk with him until he abandoned his faith and she neither ate nor drank and said:Allah has commanded you to treat well your parents and I am your mother and I command you to do this. She passed three days in this state until she fainted because of extreme hunger and at that time her son whose name was Umara stood up and served her drink and she began to curse Sad that Allah, the Exalted and Glorions, revealed these verses of the Holy Quran:\" And We have enjoined upon a person goodness to his parents but if they contend with thee to associate (others) with Me of which you have no knowledge, then obey them not\" (xxix. 8) ; Treat thein with customary good in this world\" (xxxi. 15). He also reported that there fell to the lot of Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) huge spoils of war and there was one sword in them. I picked that up and came to Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) and said: Bestow this sword upon me (as my share in the spoils of war) and you know my state. Thereupon he said: Return it to the place from where you picked it up. I went back until I decided to throw it in a store but my soul repulsed me so I came back and asked him to give that sword to me. He said in a loud voice to return it to the place from where I had picked it up. It was on this occasion that this verse was revealed:\" They asked about the spoils of war\" (viii. 1). He further said: I once fell ill and sent a message to Allahs Apostle (may peace be upon him). He visited me and I said to him: Permit me to distribute (in charity) my property as much as I like. He did not agree. I said: (Permit me to distribute) half of it. He did not agree. I said: (Permit me to distribute) the third part, whereupon he kept quiet and it was after this (that the distribution of ones property in charity) to the extent of one-third was held valid. He further said: I came to a group of persons of the Ansir and Muhajirin and they said: Come, so that we may serve you wine, and it was before the use of wine had been prohibited. I went to them in a garden and there had been with them the roasted head of a camel and a small water-skin containing wine. I ate and drank along with them and there came under discussion the Ansr (Helpers) and Muhajirin (immigrants). I said: The immigrants are better than the Ansar, that a person picked up a portion of the head (of the camel and struck me with it that my nose was injured. I came to Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) and informed him of the situation that Aliah, the Exalted and Glorious, revealed verses pertaining to wine:\" Intoxicants and the games of chance and (sacrificing to) stones set up and (divining by) arrows are only an uncleanliness, the devils work\" (v. 90).<D>Narrated Ibn `Abbas:The first lady to use a girdle was the mother of Ishmael. She used a girdle so that she might hide her tracks from Sarah. Abraham brought her and her son Ishmael while she was suckling him, to a place near the Ka`ba under a tree on the spot of Zamzam, at the highest place in the mosque. During those days there was nobody in Mecca, nor was there any water So he made them sit over there and placed near them a leather bag containing some dates, and a small water-skin containing some water, and set out homeward. Ishmaels mother followed him saying, \"O Abraham! Where are you going, leaving us in this valley where there is no person whose company we may enjoy, nor is there anything (to enjoy)?\" She repeated that to him many times, but he did not look back at her Then she asked him, \"Has Allah ordered you to do so?\" He said, \"Yes.\" She said, \"Then He will not neglect us,\" and returned while Abraham proceeded onwards, and on reaching the Thaniya where they could not see him, he faced the Ka`ba, and raising both hands, invoked Allah saying the following prayers: O our Lord! I have made some of my offspring dwell in a valley without cultivation, by Your Sacred House (Ka`ba at Mecca) in order, O our Lord, that they may offer prayer perfectly. So fill some hearts among men with love towards them, and (O Allah) provide them with fruits, so that they may give thanks. (14.37) Ishmaels mother went on suckling Ishmael and drinking from the water (she had). When the water in the water-skin had all been used up, she became thirsty and her child also became thirsty. She started looking at him (i.e. Ishmael) tossing in agony; She left him, for she could not endure looking at him, and found that the mountain of Safa was the nearest mountain to her on that land. She stood on it and started looking at the valley keenly so that she might see somebody, but she could not see anybody. Then she descended from Safa and when she reached the valley, she tucked up her robe and ran in the valley like a person in distress and trouble, till she crossed the valley and reached the Marwa mountain where she stood and started looking, expecting to see somebody, but she could not see anybody. She repeated that (running between Safa and Marwa) seven times.\" The Prophet said, \"This is the source of the tradition of the walking of people between them (i.e. Safa and Marwa). When she reached the Marwa (for the last time) she heard a voice and she asked herself to be quiet and listened attentively. She heard the voice again and said, O, (whoever you may be)! You have made me hear your voice; have you got something to help me?\" And behold! She saw an angel at the place of Zamzam, digging the earth with his heel (or his wing), till water flowed from that place. She started to make something like a basin around it, using her hand in this way, and started filling her water-skin with water with her hands, and the water was flowing out after she had scooped some of it.\" The Prophet added, \"May Allah bestow Mercy on Ishmaels mother! Had she let the Zamzam (flow without trying to control it) (or had she not scooped from that water) (to fill her water-skin), Zamzam would have been a stream flowing on the surface of the earth.\" The Prophet further added, \"Then she drank (water) and suckled her child. The angel said to her, Dont be afraid of being neglected, for this is the House of Allah which will be built by this boy and his father, and Allah never neglects His people. The House (i.e. Ka`ba) at that time was on a high place resembling a hillock, and when torrents came, they flowed to its right and left. She lived in that way till some people from the tribe of Jurhum or a family from Jurhum passed by her and her child, as they (i.e. the Jurhum people) were coming through the way of Kada. They landed in the lower part of Mecca where they saw a bird that had the habit of flying around water and not leaving it. They said, This bird must be flying around water, though we know that there is no water in this valley. They sent one or two messengers who discovered the source of water, and returned to inform them of the water. So, they all came (towards the water).\" The Prophet added, \"Ishmaels mother was sitting near the water. They asked her, Do you allow us to stay with you?\" She replied, Yes, but you will have no right to possess the water. They agreed to that.\" The Prophet further said, \"Ishmaels mother was pleased with the whole situation as she used to love to enjoy the company of the people. So, they settled there, and later on they sent for their families who came and settled with them so that some families became permanent residents there. The child (i.e. Ishmael) grew up and learnt Arabic from them and (his virtues) caused them to love and admire him as he grew up, and when he reached the age of puberty they made him marry a woman from amongst them. After Ishmaels mother had died, Abraham came after Ishmaels marriage in order to see his family that he had left before, but he did not find Ishmael there. When he asked Ishmaels wife about him, she replied, He has gone in search of our livelihood. Then he asked her about their way of living and their condition, and she replied, We are living in misery; we are living in hardship and destitution, complaining to him. He said, When your husband returns, convey my salutation to him and tell him to change the threshold of the gate (of his house). When Ishmael came, he seemed to have felt something unusual, so he asked his wife, Has anyone visited you? She replied, Yes, an old man of so-and-so description came and asked me about you and I informed him, and he asked about our state of living, and I told him that we were living in a hardship and poverty. On that Ishmael said, Did he advise you anything? She replied, Yes, he told me to convey his salutation to you and to tell you to change the threshold of your gate. Ishmael said, It was my father, and he has ordered me to divorce you. Go back to your family. So, Ishmael divorced her and married another woman from amongst them (i.e. Jurhum). Then Abraham stayed away from them for a period as long as Allah wished and called on them again but did not find Ishmael. So he came to Ishmaels wife and asked her about Ishmael. She said, He has gone in search of our livelihood. Abraham asked her, How are you getting on? asking her about their sustenance and living. She replied, We are prosperous and well-off (i.e. we have everything in abundance). Then she thanked Allah Abraham said, What kind of food do you eat? She said. Meat. He said, What do you drink? She said, Water.\" He said, \"O Allah! Bless their meat and water.\" The Prophet added, \"At that time they did not have grain, and if they had grain, he would have also invoked Allah to bless it.\" The Prophet added, \"If somebody has only these two things as his sustenance, his health and disposition will be badly affected, unless he lives in Mecca.\" The Prophet added,\" Then Abraham said Ishmaels wife, \"When your husband comes, give my regards to him and tell him that he should keep firm the threshold of his gate. When Ishmael came back, he asked his wife, Did anyone call on you? She replied, Yes, a good-looking old man came to me, so she praised him and added. He asked about you, and I informed him, and he asked about our livelihood and I told him that we were in a good condition. Ishmael asked her, Did he give you any piece of advice? She said, Yes, he told me to give his regards to you and ordered that you should keep firm the threshold of your gate. On that Ishmael said, It was my father, and you are the threshold (of the gate). He has ordered me to keep you with me. Then Abraham stayed away from them for a period as long as Allah wished, and called on them afterwards. He saw Ishmael under a tree near Zamzam, sharpening his arrows. When he saw Abraham, he rose up to welcome him (and they greeted each other as a father does with his son or a son does with his father). Abraham said, O Ishmael! Allah has given me an order. Ishmael said, Do what your Lord has ordered you to do. Abraham asked, Will you help me? Ishmael said, I will help you. Abraham said, Allah has ordered me to build a house here, pointing to a hillock higher than the land surrounding it.\" The Prophet added, \"Then they raised the foundations of the House (i.e. the Ka`ba). Ishmael brought the stones and Abraham was building, and when the walls became high, Ishmael brought this stone and put it for Abraham who stood over it and carried on building, while Ishmael was handing him the stones, and both of them were saying, O our Lord! Accept (this service) from us, Verily, You are the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing. The Prophet added, \"Then both of them went on building and going round the Ka`ba saying: O our Lord ! Accept (this service) from us, Verily, You are the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing.\" (2.127)<D>Allah then said to them after He brought them back to life: (And fight in the way of Allah) in obedience of Allah against your enemies, (and know that Allah is Hearer) of what you say, (Knower) of your intentions and the punishment that is going to visit you if you disobey what you have been commanded to do.<D>(Say: O People of the Scripture! Why drive ye back believers) in Allah, Muhammad and the Quran (from the way of Allah) from the Religion of Allah and His worship, (seeking to make it crooked, when you are witnesses?) when you know it to be in the Scripture. (Allah is not unaware of what ye do) Allah is not oblivious to your disbelief: concealing the Truth and committing transgressions. This verse was revealed about those who invited Ammar [Ibn Yasir] and his fellow Muslims to join their religion: Judaism.<D>Allah then mentions His covenant with the Children of Israel, saying: (And when We made a covenant with the Children of Israel: Worship none save Allah) declare Him as the only true God and do not ascribe any partner to Him, (and be good to parents) be dutiful to them (and to kindred) and keep contact with relatives (and to orphans) and be kind to orphans (and the needy) and generous to the needy, (and speak kindly to mankind) say the Truth regarding Muhammad (pbuh); (and establish prayer) perfect the five daily prayers (and pay the poor-due) and give from your wealth what is due to the poor. (Then, after that, ye slid back) you turned back on this covenant, (save a few of you) from amongst your forefathers; as it is said that this refers to Abdullah Ibn Salam and his companions, (being averse) denying and leaving it aside. ", "Generated_Answer": "<think>\nOkay, so I just read this situation where someone helped pick up a beer can for a woman who was acting strangely, possibly drunk or on drugs. The person is worried about whether they've committed a sin by handling alcohol, even though it was just picking up a can. They're also concerned about the woman touching their hand while talking. I need to figure out how to address these concerns from an Islamic perspective.\n\nFirst, I should recall the Islamic rulings on alcohol. I know that consuming alcohol is haram, but what about handling it? I think there's a difference between consuming and handling. Maybe handling isn't haram, but it's discouraged if it's for the purpose of consuming. But in this case, the person was just picking up the can that fell, not consuming it or helping someone else to consume it.\n\nThen, there's the part about the woman touching their hand. Touching someone of the opposite gender without a valid reason is not allowed in Islam. It's considered a form of physical contact that can lead to inappropriate situations. So, the person felt uncomfortable, which is understandable.\n\nI should also think about the intentions behind the actions. The person picked up the can to help, which is a good intention. But the act of handling alcohol might have some implications. Maybe it's not a sin, but it's something to be cautious about in the future.\n\nTo make up for it, perhaps the person should seek forgiveness and be more mindful in the future. For the touching part, they could have politely moved away or indicated discomfort, but since it's already done, they should reflect on how to handle similar situations next time.\n\nI should also consider any relevant Hadith or Quranic verses. For example, the Quran mentions that alcohol is the work of Satan and should be avoided. As for physical contact, there are teachings about modesty and avoiding unnecessary touch between genders.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the person didn't sin by picking up the can, but they should be cautious. They should avoid such situations in the future and reflect on their actions to strengthen their faith. For the touching, they should remember to maintain boundaries in the future.\n</think>\n\nIn addressing the concerns from an Islamic perspective:\n\n1. **Handling Alcohol**: Handling alcohol, such as picking up a beer can, is not considered haram if it is not for the purpose of consumption. The intention was to help, which is a positive act. Therefore, no sin is incurred, though caution is advised in similar future situations.\n\n2"}

I'm not super familiar with all the Islamic practices, but I know wudhu is a purification ritual before prayers. Let me try to break this down.\n\nFirst, I remember that in Islam, modesty is important, especially for women. I think women are supposed to cover their hair in public, but I'm not sure if that applies during wudhu. Wudhu involves washing the face, arms, head, and feet, so maybe the hair is involved in that process. If she's washing her hair, does she need to cover it before or after? Or is it about covering it during the actual wudhu?\n\nI also recall that during prayer, women are supposed to cover their hair, but wudhu is a separate act. Maybe the rules are different. I'm not sure if the obligation to cover hair is the same during wudhu as it is in other situations.\n\nI should consider the steps of wudhu. Typically, it's washing the face, then the arms, then wetting the head, and then the feet. When wetting the head, does that mean the hair is already exposed? So perhaps during wudhu, the hair is uncovered because she needs to wash it. But does she need to cover it immediately after? Or is it only about the act of washing?\n\nWait, maybe the issue isn't about covering during wudhu, but rather whether the hair needs to be covered before or after. If she's performing wudhu in a place where she's alone, maybe it's not necessary. But if she's in a public place, she might need to cover it for modesty. But I'm not sure if that affects the validity of wudhu.\n\nI also think about the concept of 'awrah,' which refers to parts of the body that should be covered. For women, the awrah in prayer is everything except the face and hands, but I'm not sure how that applies to wudhu. Maybe during wudhu, the same rules apply, so she should cover her awrah, which would include her hair.\n\nBut then again, during wudhu, she's washing parts of her body, so perhaps she needs to have them uncovered to wash them properly. So maybe she doesn't need to cover her hair while performing wudhu, but should cover"}

It's making me worried that I might be doing something wrong. I'm not sure if it's because of the hijab itself or maybe the way I'm taking care of my hair. I want to find out if there's a specific type of cloth that hijabs should be made of to help reduce hair loss. \n\nFirst, I should think about why hijab wearers might experience hair loss. I remember reading somewhere that tight clothing can cause hair loss because it puts stress on the hair follicles. So maybe the way I tie my hijab is too tight. I usually wrap it around my head a couple of times and then pin it under my chin. Maybe the tension from the pins or the fabric is causing some friction or pulling on my scalp.\n\nI also heard that the material of the hijab can make a difference. Some fabrics might be rougher on the hair, causing more friction and leading to breakage. Maybe I'm using a fabric that's too harsh. I usually wear hijabs made of cotton or polyester. I know cotton is a natural fiber, but maybe it's not the best for my hair. Are there other materials that are gentler?\n\nI should consider the types of fabric available for hijabs. There's silk, which is smooth and might reduce friction. But silk can be slippery, so maybe it's not the best if I'm worried about the hijab staying in place. Then there's chiffon or georgette, which are lightweight and soft. Maybe those would be better options because they're less likely to cause friction.\n\nAnother thing to think about is how I care for my hair under the hijab. I usually braid it or put it into a bun before covering it. Maybe these styles are too tight and are contributing to hair loss. I should try loose styles or maybe just leave it in a loose bun without tight braids.\n\nI also wonder if I'm using the right products for my hair. Maybe I'm using harsh shampoos or conditioners that are stripping my hair of its natural oils, leading to dryness and breakage. I should consider using sulfate-free shampoos and deep conditioning treatments to keep my hair healthy.\n\nHydration is another factor. If I'm not drinking enough water, my hair might be suffering. I should make sure I'm staying hydrated and maybe take vitamins that promote hair health,"}

Abraham brought her and her son Ishmael while she was suckling him, to a place near the Ka`ba under a tree on the spot of Zamzam, at the highest place in the mosque. During those days there was nobody in Mecca, nor was there any water So he made them sit over there and placed near them a leather bag containing some dates, and a small water-skin containing some water, and set out homeward. Ishmaels mother followed him saying, \"O Abraham! Where are you going, leaving us in this valley where there is no person whose company we may enjoy, nor is there anything (to enjoy)?\" She repeated that to him many times, but he did not look back at her Then she asked him, \"Has Allah ordered you to do so?\" He said, \"Yes.\" She said, \"Then He will not neglect us,\" and returned while Abraham proceeded onwards, and on reaching the Thaniya where they could not see him, he faced the Ka`ba, and raising both hands, invoked Allah saying the following prayers: O our Lord! I have made some of my offspring dwell in a valley without cultivation, by Your Sacred House (Ka`ba at Mecca) in order, O our Lord, that they may offer prayer perfectly. So fill some hearts among men with love towards them, and (O Allah) provide them with fruits, so that they may give thanks. (14.37) Ishmaels mother went on suckling Ishmael and drinking from the water (she had). When the water in the water-skin had all been used up, she became thirsty and her child also became thirsty. She started looking at him (i.e. Ishmael) tossing in agony; She left him, for she could not endure looking at him, and found that the mountain of Safa was the nearest mountain to her on that land. She stood on it and started looking at the valley keenly so that she might see somebody, but she could not see anybody. Then she descended from Safa and when she reached the valley, she tucked up her robe and ran in the valley like a person in distress and trouble, till she crossed the valley and reached the Marwa mountain where she stood and started looking, expecting to see somebody, but she could not see anybody. She repeated that (running between Safa and Marwa) seven times.\" The Prophet said, \"This is the source of the tradition of the walking of people between them (i.e. Safa and Marwa). When she reached the Marwa (for the last time) she heard a voice and she asked herself to be quiet and listened attentively. She heard the voice again and said, O, (whoever you may be)! You have made me hear your voice; have you got something to help me?\" And behold! She saw an angel at the place of Zamzam, digging the earth with his heel (or his wing), till water flowed from that place. She started to make something like a basin around it, using her hand in this way, and started filling her water-skin with water with her hands, and the water was flowing out after she had scooped some of it.\" The Prophet added, \"May Allah bestow Mercy on Ishmaels mother! Had she let the Zamzam (flow without trying to control it) (or had she not scooped from that water) (to fill her water-skin), Zamzam would have been a stream flowing on the surface of the earth.\" The Prophet further added, \"Then she drank (water) and suckled her child. The angel said to her, Dont be afraid of being neglected, for this is the House of Allah which will be built by this boy and his father, and Allah never neglects His people. The House (i.e. Ka`ba) at that time was on a high place resembling a hillock, and when torrents came, they flowed to its right and left. She lived in that way till some people from the tribe of Jurhum or a family from Jurhum passed by her and her child, as they (i.e. the Jurhum people) were coming through the way of Kada. They landed in the lower part of Mecca where they saw a bird that had the habit of flying around water and not leaving it. They said, This bird must be flying around water, though we know that there is no water in this valley. They sent one or two messengers who discovered the source of water, and returned to inform them of the water. So, they all came (towards the water).\" The Prophet added, \"Ishmaels mother was sitting near the water. They asked her, Do you allow us to stay with you?\" She replied, Yes, but you will have no right to possess the water. They agreed to that.\" The Prophet further said, \"Ishmaels mother was pleased with the whole situation as she used to love to enjoy the company of the people. So, they settled there, and later on they sent for their families who came and settled with them so that some families became permanent residents there. The child (i.e. Ishmael) grew up and learnt Arabic from them and (his virtues) caused them to love and admire him as he grew up, and when he reached the age of puberty they made him marry a woman from amongst them. After Ishmaels mother had died, Abraham came after Ishmaels marriage in order to see his family that he had left before, but he did not find Ishmael there. When he asked Ishmaels wife about him, she replied, He has gone in search of our livelihood. Then he asked her about their way of living and their condition, and she replied, We are living in misery; we are living in hardship and destitution, complaining to him. He said, When your husband returns, convey my salutation to him and tell him to change the threshold of the gate (of his house). When Ishmael came, he seemed to have felt something unusual, so he asked his wife, Has anyone visited you? She replied, Yes, an old man of so-and-so description came and asked me about you and I informed him, and he asked about our state of living, and I told him that we were living in a hardship and poverty. On that Ishmael said, Did he advise you anything? She replied, Yes, he told me to convey his salutation to you and to tell you to change the threshold of your gate. Ishmael said, It was my father, and he has ordered me to divorce you. Go back to your family. So, Ishmael divorced her and married another woman from amongst them (i.e. Jurhum). Then Abraham stayed away from them for a period as long as Allah wished and called on them again but did not find Ishmael. So he came to Ishmaels wife and asked her about Ishmael. She said, He has gone in search of our livelihood. Abraham asked her, How are you getting on? asking her about their sustenance and living. She replied, We are prosperous and well-off (i.e. we have everything in abundance). Then she thanked Allah Abraham said, What kind of food do you eat? She said. Meat. He said, What do you drink? She said, Water.\" He said, \"O Allah! Bless their meat and water.\" The Prophet added, \"At that time they did not have grain, and if they had grain, he would have also invoked Allah to bless it.\" The Prophet added, \"If somebody has only these two things as his sustenance, his health and disposition will be badly affected, unless he lives in Mecca.\" The Prophet added,\" Then Abraham said Ishmaels wife, \"When your husband comes, give my regards to him and tell him that he should keep firm the threshold of his gate. When Ishmael came back, he asked his wife, Did anyone call on you? She replied, Yes, a good-looking old man came to me, so she praised him and added. He asked about you, and I informed him, and he asked about our livelihood and I told him that we were in a good condition. Ishmael asked her, Did he give you any piece of advice? She said, Yes, he told me to give his regards to you and ordered that you should keep firm the threshold of your gate. On that Ishmael said, It was my father, and you are the threshold (of the gate). He has ordered me to keep you with me. Then Abraham stayed away from them for a period as long as Allah wished, and called on them afterwards. He saw Ishmael under a tree near Zamzam, sharpening his arrows. When he saw Abraham, he rose up to welcome him (and they greeted each other as a father does with his son or a son does with his father). Abraham said, O Ishmael! Allah has given me an order. Ishmael said, Do what your Lord has ordered you to do. Abraham asked, Will you help me? Ishmael said, I will help you. Abraham said, Allah has ordered me to build a house here, pointing to a hillock higher than the land surrounding it.\" The Prophet added, \"Then they raised the foundations of the House (i.e. the Ka`ba). Ishmael brought the stones and Abraham was building, and when the walls became high, Ishmael brought this stone and put it for Abraham who stood over it and carried on building, while Ishmael was handing him the stones, and both of them were saying, O our Lord! Accept (this service) from us, Verily, You are the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing. The Prophet added, \"Then both of them went on building and going round the Ka`ba saying: O our Lord ! Accept (this service) from us, Verily, You are the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing.\" (2.127)<D>Narrated Aisha:(The wife of the Prophet) Whenever Allahs Apostle intended to go on a journey, he used to draw lots among his wives and would take with him the one on whom the lot had fallen. Once he drew lots when he wanted to carry out a Ghazwa, and the lot came upon me. So I proceeded with Allahs Apostle after Allahs order of veiling (the women) had been revealed and thus I was carried in my howdah (on a camel) and dismounted while still in it. We carried on our journey, and when Allahs Apostle had finished his Ghazwa and returned and we approached Medina, Allahs Apostle ordered to proceed at night. When the army was ordered to resume the homeward journey, I got up and walked on till I left the army (camp) behind. When I had answered the call of nature, I went towards my howdah, but behold ! A necklace of mine made of Jaz Azfar (a kind of black bead) was broken and I looked for it and my search for it detained me. The group of people who used to carry me, came and carried my howdah on to the back of my camel on which I was riding, considering that I was therein. At that time women were light in weight and were not fleshy for they used to eat little (food), so those people did not feel the lightness of the howdah while raising it up, and I was still a young lady. They drove away the camel and proceeded. Then I found my necklace after the army had gone. I came to their camp but found nobody therein so I went to the place where I used to stay, thinking that they would miss me and come back in my search. While I was sitting at my place, I felt sleepy and slept. Safwan bin Al-Muattil As-Sulami Adh- Dhakw-ani was behind the army. He had started in the last part of the night and reached my stationing place in the morning and saw the figure of a sleeping person. He came to me and recognized me on seeing me for he used to see me before veiling. I got up because of his saying: \"Inna Li l-lahi wa inna ilaihi rajiun,\" which he uttered on recognizing me. I covered my face with my garment, and by Allah, he did not say to me a single word except, \"Inna Li l-lahi wa inna ilaihi rajiun,\" till he made his shecamel kneel down whereupon he trod on its forelegs and I mounted it. Then Safwan set out, leading the she-camel that was carrying me, till we met the army while they were resting during the hot midday. Then whoever was meant for destruction, fell in destruction, and the leader of the Ifk (forged statement) was `Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul. After this we arrived at Medina and I became ill for one month while the people were spreading the forged statements of the people of the Ifk, and I was not aware of anything thereof. But what aroused my doubt while I was sick, was that I was no longer receiving from Allahs Apostle the same kindness as I used to receive when I fell sick. Allahs Apostle would enter upon me, say a greeting and add, \"How is that (lady)?\" and then depart. That aroused my suspicion but I was not aware of the propagated evil till I recovered from my ailment. I went out with Um Mistah to answer the call of nature towards Al-Manasi, the place where we used to relieve ourselves, and used not to go out for this purpose except from night to night, and that was before we had lavatories close to our houses. And this habit of ours was similar to the habit of the old Arabs (in the deserts or in the tents) concerning the evacuation of the bowels, for we considered it troublesome and harmful to take lavatories in the houses. So I went out with Um Mistah who was the daughter of Abi Ruhm bin `Abd Manaf, and her mother was daughter of Sakhr bin Amir who was the aunt of Abi Bakr As-Siddiq, and her son was Mistah bin Uthatha. When we had finished our affair, Um Mistah and I came back towards my house. Um Mistah stumbled over her robe whereupon she said, \"Let Mistah be ruined ! \" I said to her, \"What a bad word you have said! Do you abuse a man who has taken part in the Battle of Badr? She said, \"O you there! Didnt you hear what he has said?\" I said, \"And what did he say?\" She then told me the statement of the people of the Ifk (forged statement) which added to my ailment. When I returned home, Allahs Apostle came to me, and after greeting, he said, \"How is that (lady)?\" I said, \"Will you allow me to go to my parents?\" At that time I intended to be sure of the news through them. Allahs Apostle allowed me and I went to my parents and asked my mother, \"O my mother! What are the people talking about?\" My mother said, \"O my daughter! Take it easy, for by Allah, there is no charming lady who is loved by her husband who has other wives as well, but that those wives would find fault with her.\" I said, \"Subhan Allah! Did the people really talk about that?\" That night I kept on weeping the whole night till the morning. My tears never stopped, nor did I sleep, and morning broke while I was still weeping, Allahs Apostle called `Ali bin Abi Talib and Usama bin Zaid when the Divine Inspiration delayed, in order to consult them as to the idea of divorcing his wife. Usama bin Zaid told Allahs Apostle of what he knew about the innocence of his wife and of his affection he kept for her. He said, \"O Allahs Apostle! She is your wife, and we do not know anything about her except good.\" But `Ali bin Abi Talib said, \"O Allahs Apostle! Allah does not impose restrictions on you; and there are plenty of women other than her. If you however, ask (her) slave girl, she will tell you the truth.\" `Aisha added: So Allahs Apostle called for Barira and said, \"O Barira! Did you ever see anything which might have aroused your suspicion? (as regards Aisha). Barira said, \"By Allah Who has sent you with the truth, I have never seen anything regarding Aisha which I would blame her for except that she is a girl of immature age who sometimes sleeps and leaves the dough of her family unprotected so that the domestic goats come and eat it.\" So Allahs Apostle got up (and addressed) the people an asked for somebody who would take revenge on `Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul then. Allahs Apostle, while on the pulpit, said, \"O Muslims! Who will help me against a man who has hurt me by slandering my family? By Allah, I know nothing except good about my family, and people have blamed a man of whom I know nothing except good, and he never used to visit my family except with me,\" Sa`d bin Mu`adh Al-Ansari got up and said, \"O Allahs Apostle! By Allah, I will relieve you from him. If he be from the tribe of (Bani) Al-Aus, then I will chop his head off; and if he be from our brethren, the Khazraj, then you give us your order and we will obey it.\" On that, Sa`d bin Ubada got up, and he was the chief of the Khazraj, and before this incident he had been a pious man but he was incited by his zeal for his tribe. He said to Sa`d (bin Mu`adh), \"By Allah the Eternal, you have told a lie! You shall not kill him and you will never be able to kill him!\" On that, Usaid bin Hudair, the cousin of Sa`d (bin Mu`adh) got up and said to Sa`d bin Ubada, \"You are a liar! By Allah the Eternal, we will surely kill him; and you are a hypocrite defending the hypocrites!\" So the two tribes of Al-Aus and Al-Khazraj got excited till they were on the point of fighting with each other while Allahs Apostle was standing on the pulpit. Allahs Apostle continued quietening them till they became silent whereupon he became silent too. On that day I kept on weeping so much that neither did my tears stop, nor could I sleep. In the morning my parents were with me, and I had wept for two nights and a day without sleeping and with incessant tears till they thought that my liver would burst with weeping. While they were with me and I was weeping, an Ansari woman asked permission to see me. I admitted her and she sat and started weeping with me. While I was in that state, Allahs Apostle came to us, greeted, and sat down,. He had never sat with me since the day what was said, was said. He had stayed a month without receiving any Divine Inspiration concerning my case. Allahs Apostle recited the Tashahhud after he had sat down, and then said, \"Thereafter, O `Aisha! I have been informed such and-such a thing about you; and if you are innocent, Allah will reveal your innocence, and if you have committed a sin, then ask for Allahs forgiveness and repent to Him, for when a slave confesses his sin and then repents to Allah, Allah accepts his repentance.\" When Allahs Apostle had finished his speech, my tears ceased completely so that I no longer felt even a drop thereof. Then I said to my father, \"Reply to Allahs Apostle on my behalf as to what he said.\" He said, \"By Allah, I do not know what to say to Allahs Apostle.\" Then I said to my mother, \"Reply to Allahs Apostle.\" She said, \"I do not know what to say to Allahs Apostle.\" Still a young girl as I was and though I had little knowledge of Quran, I said, \"By Allah, I know that you heard this story (of the Ifk) so much so that it has been planted in your minds and you have believed it. So now, if I tell you that I am innocent, and Allah knows that I am innocent, you will not believe me; and if I confess something, and Allah knows that I am innocent of it, you will believe me. By Allah, I cannot find of you an example except that of Josephs father: \"So (for me) patience is most fitting against that which you assert and it is Allah (Alone) Whose help can be sought. Then I turned away and lay on my bed, and at that time I knew that I was innocent and that Allah would reveal my innocence. But by Allah, I never thought that Allah would sent down about my affair, Divine Inspiration that would be recited (forever), as I considered myself too unworthy to be talked of by Allah with something that was to be recited: but I hoped that Allahs Apostle might have a vision in which Allah would prove my innocence. By Allah, Allahs Apostle had not left his seat and nobody had left the house when the Divine Inspiration came to Allahs Apostle . So there overtook him the same hard condition which used to overtake him (when he was Divinely Inspired) so that the drops of his sweat were running down, like pearls, though it was a (cold) winter day, and that was because of the heaviness of the Statement which was revealed to him. When that state of Allahs Apostle was over, and he was smiling when he was relieved, the first word he said was, \"Aisha, Allah has declared your innocence.\" My mother said to me, \"Get up and go to him.\" I said, \"By Allah, I will not go to him and I will not thank anybody but Allah.\" So Allah revealed: \"Verily! They who spread the Slander are a gang among you. Think it not....\" (24.11-20). When Allah revealed this to confirm my innocence, Abu Bakr As-Siddiq who used to provide for Mistah bin Uthatha because of the latters kinship to him and his poverty, said, \"By Allah, I will never provide for Mistah anything after what he has said about Aisha\". So Allah revealed: (continued...) (continuing... 1): -6.274:... ... \"Let not those among you who are good and are wealthy swear not to give (help) to their kinsmen, those in need, and those who have left their homes for Allahs Cause. Let them Pardon and forgive (i.e. do not punish them). Do you not love that should forgive you? Verily Allah is Oft-forgiving. Most Merciful.\" (24.22) Abu Bakr said, \"Yes, by Allah, I wish that Allah should forgive me.\" So he resumed giving Mistah the aid he used to give him before and said, \"By Allah, I will never withold it from him at all.\" Aisha further said: Allahs Apostle also asked Zainab bint Jahsh about my case. He said, \"O Zainab! What have you seen?\" She replied, \"O Allahs Apostle! I protect my hearing and my sight (by refraining from telling lies). I know nothing but good (about Aisha).\" Of all the wives of Allahs Apostle, it was Zainab who aspired to receive from him the same favor as I used to receive, yet, Allah saved her (from telling lies) because of her piety. But her sister, Hamna, kept on fighting on her behalf so she was destroyed as were those who invented and spread the slander.<D>Zainab (bint Abu Salama) (Allah be pleased with her) reported:I went to Umm Habiba, the wife of Allahs Apostle (may peace be upon him), when her father Abu Sufyan had died. Umm Habiba sent for a perfume having yellowness in it or something else like it, and she applied it to a girl and then rubbed it on her cheeks and then said: By Allah, I need no perfume but for the fact that I heard Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) say on the pulpit:\" It is not permissible for a woman believing in Allah and the Hereafter to mourn for the dead beyond three days, but (in case of the death) of the husband it is permissible for four months and ten days.\" Zainab said: I then visited Zainab hint Jahsh (Allah be pleased with her) when her brother died and she sent for perfume and applied it and then said: By Allah, I dont feel any need for the perfume but that I heard Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) say on the pulpit:\" It is not permissible for a woman believing in Allah and the Hereafbler to mourn the dead beyond three days except in case of her husband (for whom she can mourn) for four months and ten days.\" Zainab (Allah be pleased with her) said: I heard my mother Umm Salama (Allah be pleased with her) as saying: A woman came to Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) and said: Allahs Messenger. I have a daughter whose husband has died and there has developed some trouble in her eye; should we apply collyrium to it? Thereupon Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: No (repeating it twice or thrice, saying only, NO\" all the time). Then he said: It is only four mouths and ten days, whereas in the preIslamic period none of you threw away the dung until one year had passed. Humaid said: I said to Zainab: What is this throwing of dung until a year is passed? Zainab said: When the husband of a woman died, she went into a hut and put on her worst clothes, and did not apply perfume or something like it until a year was over. Then an animal like a donkey, or a goat, or a bird was brought to her and she rubbed her hand over it, and it so happened that one on which she rubbed her hand died. She then came out of her house and she was given dung and she threw it and then she made use of anything like perfume or something else as she liked.<D>(Divorce must be pronounced twice) He says: the divorce in which a man is entitled to take back his wife is pronounced once on two separate occasions (and then (a woman) must be retained) before she is pronounced divorced a third time and before performing major ritual ablution from the third menstruation (in honour) with kind companionship and intercourse (or released in kindness) or divorced a third time with such kindness as restores her rights. (And it is not lawful for you that ye take from women aught of that which ye have given them) of dowry; (except (in the case) when both arbiters) when the husband and wifeboth know that she wants to ransom her divorce (fear that they may not be able to keep the limits (imposed by) Allah) the rulings of Allah regulating the relationship between husband and wife. (And if ye fear) if you know (that they may not be able to keep the limits (imposed by) Allah) the rulings of Allah regulating the relationship between husband and wife, (in that case it is no sin for either of them) and especially the husband (if the woman ransom herself) if the husband takes what the woman ransoms herself with, out of the generosity of her soul. This verse was revealed about Thabit Ibn Qays Ibn Shammas whose wife Jamilah was the daughter of Abdullah Ibn Ubayy Ibn Salul, chief of the hypocrites. This woman ransomed her divorce from her husband by giving him back what he gave her as dowry. (These are the limits of Allah) the rulings of Allah regulating the relationship between husband and wife, (Transgress them not) do not step beyond that which Allah has prohibited. (For whoso transgresseth Allahs limits) steps beyond them: (such are wrong-doers) harmful to themselves.<D>(And of His signs) of the signs of His divine Oneness and power (is this: He created for you spouses) human beings like yourselves (from yourselves that ye might find rest in them) so that the husband may find rest in his wife, (and He ordained between you) husband and wife (love) love of the wife for her husband (and mercy) of the husband towards his wife; it is also said that this means: love of the young ones of the old ones and mercy from the older ones towards the young ones. (Lo, herein) in that which I have mentioned (indeed are portents) signs and lessons (for folk who reflect) upon what Allah created.<D>(And (it was said unto him): Take in thine hand) O Job (a branch) of 100 spikes of grain (and smite therewith) and smite with it your wife, Rahmah the daughter of the Prophet Joseph, (and break not thine oath) this is because he vowed before that if Allah were to cure him, he would flog his wife 100 lashes because she said something which did not please Allah.

She had a hard marriage with a jealous and abusive husband, which led to depression. Now, her kids are taking after their father, especially her daughter who is jealous and causing problems. She doesn't agree with her daughter's behavior towards her daughter-in-law, niece, or others. They both have ongoing issues, and she wants her daughter to know she loves her, even though her daughter feels hated. She needs advice on how to make her daughter believe otherwise.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the dynamics here. The mother has been through abuse and depression, which is already a heavy burden. Now, her children, especially her daughter, are exhibiting similar traits to the abusive father. This must be really painful for her. The daughter is married, and both mother and daughter have ongoing problems, which suggests a long-standing issue.\n\nI should consider the possible reasons why the daughter is acting this way. It could be learned behavior from her father, as children often mimic what they see at home. Alternatively, there might be unresolved issues from the past that haven't been addressed. The mother's depression might have also affected the family dynamics, possibly leading to the daughter feeling neglected or misunderstood.\n\nThe mother's main goal is to make her daughter understand that she loves her, despite their conflicts. To do this, she needs to approach the situation with empathy and possibly seek a way to communicate effectively without escalating the issues. It's important for the mother to set boundaries while also expressing her love.\n\nI should think about steps the mother can take. Maybe starting with a calm conversation where she expresses her feelings without blaming her daughter. Acknowledging the daughter's feelings might help her feel heard and understood. It might also be beneficial for them to seek family therapy to work through their issues with a neutral third party.\n\nAnother consideration is the mother's own well-being. Dealing with an abusive past and now a strained relationship with her daughter can be overwhelming. Encouraging her to seek support, whether through therapy or support groups, could help her cope and provide her with strategies to handle the situation with her daughter.\n\nI should also think about the role of the rest of the family. The mother mentions that her kids know what their father did, so perhaps they have their own feelings about it. The daughter's jealousy could be a manifestation of deeper insecurities or unresolved family issues. It might help to address the family dynamics as a whole rather than just focusing on"}

I'm not super familiar with all the religious teachings on this, but I know that in some faiths, like Islam, there are specific rules about alcohol. I think alcohol is generally prohibited, so maybe that's where the concern is coming from.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the pharmacist's role. Pharmacists dispense medications prescribed by doctors. They have to consider what's best for the patient's health. If a medicine with alcohol is the most effective or only available option, the pharmacist might have to choose that. But if there's an alternative without alcohol, maybe they should suggest that instead.\n\nI'm wondering if the pharmacist is directly responsible for the patient's decision to use the medicine. If the pharmacist just provides the medication as prescribed, are they contributing to the sin if the patient uses it? Or is it the patient's responsibility to decide whether to take it or not?\n\nAlso, maybe the pharmacist has a duty to inform the patient about the alcohol content and suggest alternatives if possible. That way, they're not just selling the medicine but also helping the patient make an informed choice that aligns with their beliefs.\n\nI'm thinking about free will here. The pharmacist provides the medication, but it's up to the patient whether to use it. So maybe the sin, if any, would fall on the patient, not the pharmacist. But if the pharmacist knows that there's an alternative and doesn't offer it, maybe they share some responsibility.\n\nAnother angle is the intention behind selling the medicine. If the pharmacist's intention is to help the patient get better, that's a good intention. But if they're aware of the alcohol content and don't care about the patient's beliefs, maybe that's where the sin comes in.\n\nI'm also recalling something about greater good. If the medicine with alcohol is necessary for the patient's health, maybe the benefit outweighs the use of alcohol. It's like using the least harmful option possible.\n\nI should also consider different religious perspectives. In Islam, for example, anything that is harmful or impure is prohibited. So if alcohol is in the medicine, it might be considered impure. But there are exceptions for medical necessity. So maybe using such medicine is allowed if there's no alternative.\n\nWait, but if there is an alternative without alcohol, then using the one with alcohol might not be necessary."}

And Allah Taala ( ) knows best", "Document": "Narrated `Aisha:(the wife of the Prophet) \"I do not remember my parents believing in any religion other than the Religion (of Islam), and our being visited by Allahs Apostle in the morning and in the evening. One day, while we were sitting in the house of Abu Bakr (my father) at noon, someone said, This is Allahs Apostle coming at an hour at which he never used to visit us. Abu Bakr said, There must be something very urgent that has brought him at this hour. The Prophet said, I have been allowed to go out (of Mecca) to migrate. \"<D>Narrated Aisha:(the wife of the Prophet) \"Whenever Allahs Apostle intended to go on a journey, he would draw lots amongst his wives and would take with him the one upon whom the lot fell. During a Ghazwa of his, he drew lots amongst us and the lot fell upon me, and I proceeded with him after Allah had decreed the use of the veil by women. I was carried in a Howdah (on the camel) and dismounted while still in it. When Allahs Apostle was through with his Ghazwa and returned home, and we approached the city of Medina, Allahs Apostle ordered us to proceed at night. When the order of setting off was given, I walked till I was past the army to answer the call of nature. After finishing I returned (to the camp) to depart (with the others) and suddenly realized that my necklace over my chest was missing. So, I returned to look for it and was delayed because of that. The people who used to carry me on the camel, came to my Howdah and put it on the back of the camel, thinking that I was in it, as, at that time, women were light in weight, and thin and lean, and did not use to eat much. So, those people did not feel the difference in the heaviness of the Howdah while lifting it, and they put it over the camel. At that time I was a young lady. They set the camel moving and proceeded on. I found my necklace after the army had gone, and came to their camp to find nobody. So, I went to the place where I used to stay, thinking that they would discover my absence and come back in my search. While in that state, I felt sleepy and slept. Safwan bin Muattal As-Sulami Adh-Dhakwani was behind the army and reached my abode in the morning. When he saw a sleeping person, he came to me, and he used to see me before veiling. So, I got up when I heard him saying, \"Inna lil-lah-wa inn a ilaihi rajiun (We are for Allah, and we will return to Him).\" He made his camel knell down. He got down from his camel, and put his leg on the front legs of the camel and then I rode and sat over it. Safwan set out walking, leading the camel by the rope till we reached the army who had halted to take rest at midday. Then whoever was meant for destruction, fell into destruction, (some people accused me falsely) and the leader of the false accusers was `Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul. After that we returned to Medina, and I became ill for one month while the people were spreading the forged statements of the false accusers. I was feeling during my ailment as if I were not receiving the usual kindness from the Prophet which I used to receive from him when I got sick. But he would come, greet and say, How is that (girl)? I did not know anything of what was going on till I recovered from my ailment and went out with Um Mistah to the Manasi where we used to answer the call of nature, and we used not to go to answer the call of nature except from night to night and that was before we had lavatories near to our houses. And this habit of ours was similar to the habit of the old Arabs in the open country (or away from houses). So. I and Um Mistah bint Ruhm went out walking. Um Mistah stumbled because of her long dress and on that she said, Let Mistah be ruined. I said, You are saying a bad word. Why are you abusing a man who took part in (the battle of) Badr? She said, O Hanata (you there) didnt you hear what they said? Then she told me the rumors of the false accusers. My sickness was aggravated, and when I returned home, Allahs Apostle came to me, and after greeting he said, How is that (girl)? I requested him to allow me to go to my parents. I wanted then to be sure of the news through them I Allahs Apostle allowed me, and I went to my parents and asked my mother, What are the people talking about? She said, O my daughter! Dont worry much about this matter. By Allah, never is there a charming woman loved by her husband who has other wives, but the women would forge false news about her. I said, Glorified be Allah! Are the people really taking of this matter? That night I kept on weeping and could not sleep till morning. In the morning Allahs Apostle called `Ali bin Abu Talib and Usama bin Zaid when he saw the Divine Inspiration delayed, to consul them about divorcing his wife (i.e. `Aisha). Usama bin Zaid said what he knew of the good reputation of his wives and added, O Allahs Apostle! Keep you wife, for, by Allah, we know nothing about her but good. `Ali bin Abu Talib said, O Allahs Apostle! Allah has no imposed restrictions on you, and there are many women other than she, yet you may ask the woman-servant who will tell you the truth. On that Allahs Apostle called Buraira and said, O Burair. Did you ever see anything which roused your suspicions about her? Buraira said, No, by Allah Who has sent you with the Truth, I have never seen in her anything faulty except that she is a girl of immature age, who sometimes sleeps and leaves the dough for the goats to eat. On that day Allahs Apostle ascended the pulpit and requested that somebody support him in punishing `Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul. Allahs Apostle said, Who will support me to punish that person (`Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul) who has hurt me by slandering the reputation of my family? By Allah, I know nothing about my family but good, and they have accused a person about whom I know nothing except good, and he never entered my house except in my company. Sa`d bin Mu`adh got up and said, O Allahs Apostle! by Allah, I will relieve you from him. If that man is from the tribe of the Aus, then we will chop his head off, and if he is from our brothers, the Khazraj, then order us, and we will fulfill your order. On that Sa`d bin Ubada, the chief of the Khazraj and before this incident, he had been a pious man, got up, motivated by his zeal for his tribe and said, By Allah, you have told a lie; you cannot kill him, and you will never be able to kill him. On that Usaid bin Al-Hadir got up and said (to Sa`d bin Ubada), By Allah! you are a liar. By Allah, we will kill him; and you are a hypocrite, defending the hypocrites. On this the two tribes of Aus and Khazraj got excited and were about to fight each other, while Allahs Apostle was standing on the pulpit. He got down and quieted them till they became silent and he kept quiet. On that day I kept on weeping so much so that neither did my tears stop, nor could I sleep. In the morning my parents were with me and I had wept for two nights and a day, till I thought my liver would burst from weeping. While they were sitting with me and I was weeping, an Ansari woman asked my permission to enter, and I allowed her to come in. She sat down and started weeping with me. While we were in this state, Allahs Apostle came and sat down and he had never sat with me since the day they forged the accusation. No revelation regarding my case came to him for a month. He recited Tashah-hud (i.e. None has the right to be worshipped but Allah and Muhammad is His Apostle) and then said, O `Aisha! I have been informed such-and-such about you; if you are innocent, then Allah will soon reveal your innocence, and if you have committed a sin, then repent to Allah and ask Him to forgive you, for when a person confesses his sin and asks Allah for forgiveness, Allah accepts his repentance. When Allahs Apostle finished his speech my tears ceased completely and there remained not even a single drop of it. I requested my father to reply to Allahs Apostle on my behalf. My father said, By Allah, I do not know what to say to Allahs Apostle. I said to my mother, Talk to Allahs Apostle on my behalf. She said, By Allah, I do not know what to say to Allahs Apostle. I was a young girl and did not have much knowledge of the Quran. I said. I know, by Allah, that you have listened to what people are saying and that has been planted in your minds and you have taken it as a truth. Now, if I told you that I am innocent and Allah knows that I am innocent, you would not believe me and if I confessed to you falsely that I am guilty, and Allah knows that I am innocent you would believe me. By Allah, I dont compare my situation with you except to the situation of Josephs father (i.e. Jacob) who said, So (for me) patience is most fitting against that which you assert and it is Allah (Alone) whose help can be sought. Then I turned to the other side of my bed hoping that Allah would prove my innocence. By Allah I never thought that Allah would reveal Divine Inspiration in my case, as I considered myself too inferior to be talked of in the Holy Quran. I had hoped that Allahs Apostle might have a dream in which Allah would prove my innocence. By Allah, Allahs Apostle had not got up and nobody had left the house before the Divine Inspiration came to Allahs Apostle. So, there overtook him the same state which used to overtake him, (when he used to have, on being inspired divinely). He was sweating so much so that the drops of the sweat were dropping like pearls though it was a (cold) wintry day. When that state of Allahs Apostle was over, he was smiling and the first word he said, `Aisha! Thank Allah, for Allah has declared your innocence. My mother told me to go to Allahs Apostle . I replied, By Allah I will not go to him and will not thank but Allah. So Allah revealed: \"Verily! They who spread the slander are a gang among you . . .\" (24.11) When Allah gave the declaration of my Innocence, Abu Bakr, who used to provide for Mistah bin Uthatha for he was his relative, said, By Allah, I will never provide Mistah with anything because of what he said about Aisha. But Allah later revealed: -- \"And let not those who are good and wealthy among you swear not to help their kinsmen, those in need and those who left their homes in Allahs Cause. Let them forgive and overlook. Do you not wish that Allah should forgive you? Verily! Allah is Oft-forgiving, Most Merciful.\" (24.22) After that Abu Bakr said, Yes ! By Allah! I like that Allah should forgive me, and resumed helping Mistah whom he used to help before. Allahs Apostle also asked Zainab bint Jahsh (i.e. the Prophets wife about me saying, What do you know and what did you see? She replied, O Allahs Apostle! I refrain to claim hearing or seeing what I have not heard or seen. By Allah, I know nothing except goodness about Aisha.\" Aisha further added \"Zainab was competing with me (in her beauty and the Prophets love), yet Allah protected her (from being malicious), for she had piety.\"<D>Narrated Ibn `Abbas:The first lady to use a girdle was the mother of Ishmael. She used a girdle so that she might hide her tracks from Sarah. Abraham brought her and her son Ishmael while she was suckling him, to a place near the Ka`ba under a tree on the spot of Zamzam, at the highest place in the mosque. During those days there was nobody in Mecca, nor was there any water So he made them sit over there and placed near them a leather bag containing some dates, and a small water-skin containing some water, and set out homeward. Ishmaels mother followed him saying, \"O Abraham! Where are you going, leaving us in this valley where there is no person whose company we may enjoy, nor is there anything (to enjoy)?\" She repeated that to him many times, but he did not look back at her Then she asked him, \"Has Allah ordered you to do so?\" He said, \"Yes.\" She said, \"Then He will not neglect us,\" and returned while Abraham proceeded onwards, and on reaching the Thaniya where they could not see him, he faced the Ka`ba, and raising both hands, invoked Allah saying the following prayers: O our Lord! I have made some of my offspring dwell in a valley without cultivation, by Your Sacred House (Ka`ba at Mecca) in order, O our Lord, that they may offer prayer perfectly. So fill some hearts among men with love towards them, and (O Allah) provide them with fruits, so that they may give thanks. (14.37) Ishmaels mother went on suckling Ishmael and drinking from the water (she had). When the water in the water-skin had all been used up, she became thirsty and her child also became thirsty. She started looking at him (i.e. Ishmael) tossing in agony; She left him, for she could not endure looking at him, and found that the mountain of Safa was the nearest mountain to her on that land. She stood on it and started looking at the valley keenly so that she might see somebody, but she could not see anybody. Then she descended from Safa and when she reached the valley, she tucked up her robe and ran in the valley like a person in distress and trouble, till she crossed the valley and reached the Marwa mountain where she stood and started looking, expecting to see somebody, but she could not see anybody. She repeated that (running between Safa and Marwa) seven times.\" The Prophet said, \"This is the source of the tradition of the walking of people between them (i.e. Safa and Marwa). When she reached the Marwa (for the last time) she heard a voice and she asked herself to be quiet and listened attentively. She heard the voice again and said, O, (whoever you may be)! You have made me hear your voice; have you got something to help me?\" And behold! She saw an angel at the place of Zamzam, digging the earth with his heel (or his wing), till water flowed from that place. She started to make something like a basin around it, using her hand in this way, and started filling her water-skin with water with her hands, and the water was flowing out after she had scooped some of it.\" The Prophet added, \"May Allah bestow Mercy on Ishmaels mother! Had she let the Zamzam (flow without trying to control it) (or had she not scooped from that water) (to fill her water-skin), Zamzam would have been a stream flowing on the surface of the earth.\" The Prophet further added, \"Then she drank (water) and suckled her child. The angel said to her, Dont be afraid of being neglected, for this is the House of Allah which will be built by this boy and his father, and Allah never neglects His people. The House (i.e. Ka`ba) at that time was on a high place resembling a hillock, and when torrents came, they flowed to its right and left. She lived in that way till some people from the tribe of Jurhum or a family from Jurhum passed by her and her child, as they (i.e. the Jurhum people) were coming through the way of Kada. They landed in the lower part of Mecca where they saw a bird that had the habit of flying around water and not leaving it. They said, This bird must be flying around water, though we know that there is no water in this valley. They sent one or two messengers who discovered the source of water, and returned to inform them of the water. So, they all came (towards the water).\" The Prophet added, \"Ishmaels mother was sitting near the water. They asked her, Do you allow us to stay with you?\" She replied, Yes, but you will have no right to possess the water. They agreed to that.\" The Prophet further said, \"Ishmaels mother was pleased with the whole situation as she used to love to enjoy the company of the people. So, they settled there, and later on they sent for their families who came and settled with them so that some families became permanent residents there. The child (i.e. Ishmael) grew up and learnt Arabic from them and (his virtues) caused them to love and admire him as he grew up, and when he reached the age of puberty they made him marry a woman from amongst them. After Ishmaels mother had died, Abraham came after Ishmaels marriage in order to see his family that he had left before, but he did not find Ishmael there. When he asked Ishmaels wife about him, she replied, He has gone in search of our livelihood. Then he asked her about their way of living and their condition, and she replied, We are living in misery; we are living in hardship and destitution, complaining to him. He said, When your husband returns, convey my salutation to him and tell him to change the threshold of the gate (of his house). When Ishmael came, he seemed to have felt something unusual, so he asked his wife, Has anyone visited you? She replied, Yes, an old man of so-and-so description came and asked me about you and I informed him, and he asked about our state of living, and I told him that we were living in a hardship and poverty. On that Ishmael said, Did he advise you anything? She replied, Yes, he told me to convey his salutation to you and to tell you to change the threshold of your gate. Ishmael said, It was my father, and he has ordered me to divorce you. Go back to your family. So, Ishmael divorced her and married another woman from amongst them (i.e. Jurhum). Then Abraham stayed away from them for a period as long as Allah wished and called on them again but did not find Ishmael. So he came to Ishmaels wife and asked her about Ishmael. She said, He has gone in search of our livelihood. Abraham asked her, How are you getting on? asking her about their sustenance and living. She replied, We are prosperous and well-off (i.e. we have everything in abundance). Then she thanked Allah Abraham said, What kind of food do you eat? She said. Meat. He said, What do you drink? She said, Water.\" He said, \"O Allah! Bless their meat and water.\" The Prophet added, \"At that time they did not have grain, and if they had grain, he would have also invoked Allah to bless it.\" The Prophet added, \"If somebody has only these two things as his sustenance, his health and disposition will be badly affected, unless he lives in Mecca.\" The Prophet added,\" Then Abraham said Ishmaels wife, \"When your husband comes, give my regards to him and tell him that he should keep firm the threshold of his gate. When Ishmael came back, he asked his wife, Did anyone call on you? She replied, Yes, a good-looking old man came to me, so she praised him and added. He asked about you, and I informed him, and he asked about our livelihood and I told him that we were in a good condition. Ishmael asked her, Did he give you any piece of advice? She said, Yes, he told me to give his regards to you and ordered that you should keep firm the threshold of your gate. On that Ishmael said, It was my father, and you are the threshold (of the gate). He has ordered me to keep you with me. Then Abraham stayed away from them for a period as long as Allah wished, and called on them afterwards. He saw Ishmael under a tree near Zamzam, sharpening his arrows. When he saw Abraham, he rose up to welcome him (and they greeted each other as a father does with his son or a son does with his father). Abraham said, O Ishmael! Allah has given me an order. Ishmael said, Do what your Lord has ordered you to do. Abraham asked, Will you help me? Ishmael said, I will help you. Abraham said, Allah has ordered me to build a house here, pointing to a hillock higher than the land surrounding it.\" The Prophet added, \"Then they raised the foundations of the House (i.e. the Ka`ba). Ishmael brought the stones and Abraham was building, and when the walls became high, Ishmael brought this stone and put it for Abraham who stood over it and carried on building, while Ishmael was handing him the stones, and both of them were saying, O our Lord! Accept (this service) from us, Verily, You are the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing. The Prophet added, \"Then both of them went on building and going round the Ka`ba saying: O our Lord ! Accept (this service) from us, Verily, You are the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing.\" (2.127)<D>(And when it was said) to them in the life of the world: (Lo!

Let me break it down step by step. \n\nFirst, the job involves handling all sorts of cargo—both incoming and outgoing. The main tasks are documentation, counting pieces, preparing cargo for flights, and storing it in warehouses using a forklift. Now, some of the cargo is alcohol or cigarettes, but that's less than 5% of the total. Also, sometimes they don't know what's inside the packages they're handling.\n\nThe person mentioned that they don't use the money earned from the time spent handling alcohol or cigarettes, maybe only about an hour a month. They’re concerned whether this job is permissible under Islamic law.\n\nOkay, so I need to consider Islamic principles here. Handling haram goods like alcohol and cigarettes is a key point. But the person isn't directly involved in selling or consuming these items; they're just part of the handling process. Plus, the proportion is small, and they're not using the money from that part of their job.\n\nI remember that in Islam, working in jobs that involve haram activities is generally not allowed. However, if the haram aspect is a minor part and the job is otherwise halal, it might be acceptable. Also, if the person isn't directly benefiting from the haram part and avoids using that money, it could be permissible.\n\nI should also consider the concept of \"ma'roof\" and \"munkar\"—doing good and avoiding evil. If the job involves more good than evil and the person is not directly involved in the haram activities, it might be okay.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure. Maybe there's a fatwa or scholarly opinion on this. I think some scholars say that if the haram part is less than half and you're not directly involved, it's permissible. But others might say any involvement is not allowed.\n\nI need to check if the primary duties are halal. Since most of the cargo is not haram, and the handling is just logistical, it might be acceptable. Also, since the person isn't using the money from the haram part, it shows their intention is to avoid benefiting from it.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the job seems halal because the haram aspect is minimal, indirect, and the person is avoiding the benefits from it. But I should also advise consulting a scholar for a definitive answer.\n</think>\n\nThe job in question involves"}

Let me start by understanding what happened. I went to the bathroom, finished washing, and used a tissue to dry up water. Then I noticed a lot of discharge. I wasn't thinking about anything sexual, but it felt weird. I sat back down, used more water to clean, and wiped with another tissue. Now I'm worried if I'm napaak, and if using textbooks, sitting on places, or using my phone and laptop will make them napaak too.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"napaak\" means. From what I know, in some cultures, particularly in certain religious or cultural contexts, \"napaak\" refers to something being impure or unclean. This concept often relates to hygiene practices, especially after using the bathroom.\n\nSo, I used a tissue to dry after washing, noticed discharge, and then cleaned again. The discharge could be from a medical issue, like a yeast infection or something else. But regardless of the reason, I'm concerned about the religious implications. \n\nI think in many belief systems, as long as you follow proper hygiene and cleaning procedures, you shouldn't be considered impure. So, by washing again and using another tissue, I might have taken the necessary steps to maintain cleanliness.\n\nNow, about the items I use afterwards—textbooks, phone, laptop. If I'm clean, then these items shouldn't become napaak just because I used them. Unless there's a specific rule in my belief system that says otherwise, but generally, as long as I'm clean, my belongings shouldn't be affected.\n\nI'm also wondering if the discharge itself makes me napaak. If it's a natural bodily function, maybe it's not a big issue. But I should probably check if there are any specific guidelines in my religion or culture about this.\n\nI should consider consulting a religious leader or a trusted person who knows the specific rules. But from what I understand, maintaining cleanliness and proper hygiene should suffice to prevent being napaak.\n\nSo, in summary, I think I took the right steps by cleaning again, so I'm probably not napaak. My belongings should be fine as long as I'm clean. But to be sure, I might want to look up specific teachings or talk to someone knowledgeable about this.\n</think>\n\nBased on the thought process and understanding of the situation, here is a concise and organized answer:\n\n**"}

I'm not very familiar with Islamic teachings, so I'll have to think this through step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that Islam has certain guidelines about what is permissible and what isn't. I remember hearing about halal and haram, which are terms for what's allowed and forbidden. So, I should consider whether dancing, especially classical Indian dance, falls into either category.\n\nClassical Indian dances, like Bharatanatyam or Kathak, often have roots in Hindu mythology and are sometimes performed in temples. That makes me wonder if participating in such dances could be seen as promoting or being involved with another religion's practices. Islam might have rules about engaging in religious practices of other faiths.\n\nI also think about the nature of dance itself. Some people might view dance as a form of self-expression or art, while others might see it as inappropriate or immodest. I should consider if there are any Islamic teachings about modesty and how dance might fit into that. For example, does the dance involve movements or attire that could be considered immodest? If so, that might be a point of concern.\n\nAnother angle is the intention behind learning the dance. If the primary reason is for physical health and discipline, that seems more acceptable. However, if the dance is tied to religious rituals or storytelling that contradicts Islamic beliefs, that could be problematic. So, the context and purpose matter a lot.\n\nI should also think about the social norms within Muslim communities. In some cultures, dancing might be frowned upon, especially for women, due to modesty standards. But in other contexts, it might be more accepted as a form of cultural expression. It probably varies widely depending on the community and cultural background.\n\nI recall that in Islam, there's a concept of \"adab,\" which relates to etiquette and appropriate behavior. This might influence whether dance is seen as acceptable, especially in terms of how it's performed and the intentions behind it.\n\nAdditionally, there's the aspect of music. Some classical Indian dances are accompanied by music, and I'm not sure about Islamic views on music and dance together. I think there are differing opinions among scholars, with some allowing certain types of music and dance as long as they don't involve impermissible elements.\n\nI also wonder if there are alternative forms of exercise or physical discipline that are more straightforwardly acceptable in Islam, such as certain sports or physical activities that don't"}

I don't know much about this name, so I'll start by breaking it down. First, I'll think about where the name comes from. It sounds like it could be Arabic, maybe? I've heard some Arabic names that start with 'Mah', like Mahdi or Maher, but Maham is new to me. \n\nI should check the meaning of Maham. Maybe it's a common name in some countries. Let me think, in Arabic, names often have meanings related to praise, beauty, or strength. So, perhaps Maham has a positive meaning. I can try to look up the meaning online, but since I'm just thinking, I'll assume it's something nice like \"praised\" or \"beloved.\"\n\nNext, cultural considerations. In some cultures, names have specific significance. For example, in Arabic culture, names are often chosen for their meanings and religious significance. So, if Maham is an accepted name in that culture, it should be fine. But I should make sure it's not a name that's considered odd or has a negative connotation elsewhere.\n\nThen, pronunciation. Maham is pronounced with a slight emphasis on the first syllable, I think: MA-ham. It's not too complicated, so people should be able to say it correctly without much trouble. But I should consider if it's easy to spell as well. M-A-H-A-M, that's straightforward, so others can spell it without issues.\n\nPopularity is another factor. If the name is too common, the girl might share it with many others, but if it's unique, it could be a nice touch. I'm not sure how popular Maham is in different regions. In some places, it might be rare, making it special, while in others, it could be more common.\n\nFamily and personal significance also matter. If the name has a special meaning to the family or holds cultural importance, that's a big plus. It could help the child connect with their heritage. But if it's a name that the family doesn't like or find odd, that could be a problem.\n\nI should also think about nicknames. Does Maham have any common nicknames? Maybe Maha or Ham. That could be cute, but it's optional. Not all names need a nickname, but it's something to consider.\n\nAnother point is how the name sounds with the surname. If the last name is"}

Once he drew lots when he wanted to carry out a Ghazwa, and the lot came upon me. So I proceeded with Allahs Apostle after Allahs order of veiling (the women) had been revealed and thus I was carried in my howdah (on a camel) and dismounted while still in it. We carried on our journey, and when Allahs Apostle had finished his Ghazwa and returned and we approached Medina, Allahs Apostle ordered to proceed at night. When the army was ordered to resume the homeward journey, I got up and walked on till I left the army (camp) behind. When I had answered the call of nature, I went towards my howdah, but behold ! A necklace of mine made of Jaz Azfar (a kind of black bead) was broken and I looked for it and my search for it detained me. The group of people who used to carry me, came and carried my howdah on to the back of my camel on which I was riding, considering that I was therein. At that time women were light in weight and were not fleshy for they used to eat little (food), so those people did not feel the lightness of the howdah while raising it up, and I was still a young lady. They drove away the camel and proceeded. Then I found my necklace after the army had gone. I came to their camp but found nobody therein so I went to the place where I used to stay, thinking that they would miss me and come back in my search. While I was sitting at my place, I felt sleepy and slept. Safwan bin Al-Muattil As-Sulami Adh- Dhakw-ani was behind the army. He had started in the last part of the night and reached my stationing place in the morning and saw the figure of a sleeping person. He came to me and recognized me on seeing me for he used to see me before veiling. I got up because of his saying: \"Inna Li l-lahi wa inna ilaihi rajiun,\" which he uttered on recognizing me. I covered my face with my garment, and by Allah, he did not say to me a single word except, \"Inna Li l-lahi wa inna ilaihi rajiun,\" till he made his shecamel kneel down whereupon he trod on its forelegs and I mounted it. Then Safwan set out, leading the she-camel that was carrying me, till we met the army while they were resting during the hot midday. Then whoever was meant for destruction, fell in destruction, and the leader of the Ifk (forged statement) was `Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul. After this we arrived at Medina and I became ill for one month while the people were spreading the forged statements of the people of the Ifk, and I was not aware of anything thereof. But what aroused my doubt while I was sick, was that I was no longer receiving from Allahs Apostle the same kindness as I used to receive when I fell sick. Allahs Apostle would enter upon me, say a greeting and add, \"How is that (lady)?\" and then depart. That aroused my suspicion but I was not aware of the propagated evil till I recovered from my ailment. I went out with Um Mistah to answer the call of nature towards Al-Manasi, the place where we used to relieve ourselves, and used not to go out for this purpose except from night to night, and that was before we had lavatories close to our houses. And this habit of ours was similar to the habit of the old Arabs (in the deserts or in the tents) concerning the evacuation of the bowels, for we considered it troublesome and harmful to take lavatories in the houses. So I went out with Um Mistah who was the daughter of Abi Ruhm bin `Abd Manaf, and her mother was daughter of Sakhr bin Amir who was the aunt of Abi Bakr As-Siddiq, and her son was Mistah bin Uthatha. When we had finished our affair, Um Mistah and I came back towards my house. Um Mistah stumbled over her robe whereupon she said, \"Let Mistah be ruined ! \" I said to her, \"What a bad word you have said! Do you abuse a man who has taken part in the Battle of Badr? She said, \"O you there! Didnt you hear what he has said?\" I said, \"And what did he say?\" She then told me the statement of the people of the Ifk (forged statement) which added to my ailment. When I returned home, Allahs Apostle came to me, and after greeting, he said, \"How is that (lady)?\" I said, \"Will you allow me to go to my parents?\" At that time I intended to be sure of the news through them. Allahs Apostle allowed me and I went to my parents and asked my mother, \"O my mother! What are the people talking about?\" My mother said, \"O my daughter! Take it easy, for by Allah, there is no charming lady who is loved by her husband who has other wives as well, but that those wives would find fault with her.\" I said, \"Subhan Allah! Did the people really talk about that?\" That night I kept on weeping the whole night till the morning. My tears never stopped, nor did I sleep, and morning broke while I was still weeping, Allahs Apostle called `Ali bin Abi Talib and Usama bin Zaid when the Divine Inspiration delayed, in order to consult them as to the idea of divorcing his wife. Usama bin Zaid told Allahs Apostle of what he knew about the innocence of his wife and of his affection he kept for her. He said, \"O Allahs Apostle! She is your wife, and we do not know anything about her except good.\" But `Ali bin Abi Talib said, \"O Allahs Apostle! Allah does not impose restrictions on you; and there are plenty of women other than her. If you however, ask (her) slave girl, she will tell you the truth.\" `Aisha added: So Allahs Apostle called for Barira and said, \"O Barira! Did you ever see anything which might have aroused your suspicion? (as regards Aisha). Barira said, \"By Allah Who has sent you with the truth, I have never seen anything regarding Aisha which I would blame her for except that she is a girl of immature age who sometimes sleeps and leaves the dough of her family unprotected so that the domestic goats come and eat it.\" So Allahs Apostle got up (and addressed) the people an asked for somebody who would take revenge on `Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul then. Allahs Apostle, while on the pulpit, said, \"O Muslims! Who will help me against a man who has hurt me by slandering my family? By Allah, I know nothing except good about my family, and people have blamed a man of whom I know nothing except good, and he never used to visit my family except with me,\" Sa`d bin Mu`adh Al-Ansari got up and said, \"O Allahs Apostle! By Allah, I will relieve you from him. If he be from the tribe of (Bani) Al-Aus, then I will chop his head off; and if he be from our brethren, the Khazraj, then you give us your order and we will obey it.\" On that, Sa`d bin Ubada got up, and he was the chief of the Khazraj, and before this incident he had been a pious man but he was incited by his zeal for his tribe. He said to Sa`d (bin Mu`adh), \"By Allah the Eternal, you have told a lie! You shall not kill him and you will never be able to kill him!\" On that, Usaid bin Hudair, the cousin of Sa`d (bin Mu`adh) got up and said to Sa`d bin Ubada, \"You are a liar! By Allah the Eternal, we will surely kill him; and you are a hypocrite defending the hypocrites!\" So the two tribes of Al-Aus and Al-Khazraj got excited till they were on the point of fighting with each other while Allahs Apostle was standing on the pulpit. Allahs Apostle continued quietening them till they became silent whereupon he became silent too. On that day I kept on weeping so much that neither did my tears stop, nor could I sleep. In the morning my parents were with me, and I had wept for two nights and a day without sleeping and with incessant tears till they thought that my liver would burst with weeping. While they were with me and I was weeping, an Ansari woman asked permission to see me. I admitted her and she sat and started weeping with me. While I was in that state, Allahs Apostle came to us, greeted, and sat down,. He had never sat with me since the day what was said, was said. He had stayed a month without receiving any Divine Inspiration concerning my case. Allahs Apostle recited the Tashahhud after he had sat down, and then said, \"Thereafter, O `Aisha! I have been informed such and-such a thing about you; and if you are innocent, Allah will reveal your innocence, and if you have committed a sin, then ask for Allahs forgiveness and repent to Him, for when a slave confesses his sin and then repents to Allah, Allah accepts his repentance.\" When Allahs Apostle had finished his speech, my tears ceased completely so that I no longer felt even a drop thereof. Then I said to my father, \"Reply to Allahs Apostle on my behalf as to what he said.\" He said, \"By Allah, I do not know what to say to Allahs Apostle.\" Then I said to my mother, \"Reply to Allahs Apostle.\" She said, \"I do not know what to say to Allahs Apostle.\" Still a young girl as I was and though I had little knowledge of Quran, I said, \"By Allah, I know that you heard this story (of the Ifk) so much so that it has been planted in your minds and you have believed it. So now, if I tell you that I am innocent, and Allah knows that I am innocent, you will not believe me; and if I confess something, and Allah knows that I am innocent of it, you will believe me. By Allah, I cannot find of you an example except that of Josephs father: \"So (for me) patience is most fitting against that which you assert and it is Allah (Alone) Whose help can be sought. Then I turned away and lay on my bed, and at that time I knew that I was innocent and that Allah would reveal my innocence. But by Allah, I never thought that Allah would sent down about my affair, Divine Inspiration that would be recited (forever), as I considered myself too unworthy to be talked of by Allah with something that was to be recited: but I hoped that Allahs Apostle might have a vision in which Allah would prove my innocence. By Allah, Allahs Apostle had not left his seat and nobody had left the house when the Divine Inspiration came to Allahs Apostle . So there overtook him the same hard condition which used to overtake him (when he was Divinely Inspired) so that the drops of his sweat were running down, like pearls, though it was a (cold) winter day, and that was because of the heaviness of the Statement which was revealed to him. When that state of Allahs Apostle was over, and he was smiling when he was relieved, the first word he said was, \"Aisha, Allah has declared your innocence.\" My mother said to me, \"Get up and go to him.\" I said, \"By Allah, I will not go to him and I will not thank anybody but Allah.\" So Allah revealed: \"Verily! They who spread the Slander are a gang among you. Think it not....\" (24.11-20). When Allah revealed this to confirm my innocence, Abu Bakr As-Siddiq who used to provide for Mistah bin Uthatha because of the latters kinship to him and his poverty, said, \"By Allah, I will never provide for Mistah anything after what he has said about Aisha\". So Allah revealed: (continued...) (continuing... 1): -6.274:... ... \"Let not those among you who are good and are wealthy swear not to give (help) to their kinsmen, those in need, and those who have left their homes for Allahs Cause. Let them Pardon and forgive (i.e. do not punish them). Do you not love that should forgive you? Verily Allah is Oft-forgiving. Most Merciful.\" (24.22) Abu Bakr said, \"Yes, by Allah, I wish that Allah should forgive me.\" So he resumed giving Mistah the aid he used to give him before and said, \"By Allah, I will never withold it from him at all.\" Aisha further said: Allahs Apostle also asked Zainab bint Jahsh about my case. He said, \"O Zainab! What have you seen?\" She replied, \"O Allahs Apostle! I protect my hearing and my sight (by refraining from telling lies). I know nothing but good (about Aisha).\" Of all the wives of Allahs Apostle, it was Zainab who aspired to receive from him the same favor as I used to receive, yet, Allah saved her (from telling lies) because of her piety. But her sister, Hamna, kept on fighting on her behalf so she was destroyed as were those who invented and spread the slander.<D>Narrated Aisha:(the wife of the Prophet) \"Whenever Allahs Apostle intended to go on a journey, he would draw lots amongst his wives and would take with him the one upon whom the lot fell. During a Ghazwa of his, he drew lots amongst us and the lot fell upon me, and I proceeded with him after Allah had decreed the use of the veil by women. I was carried in a Howdah (on the camel) and dismounted while still in it. When Allahs Apostle was through with his Ghazwa and returned home, and we approached the city of Medina, Allahs Apostle ordered us to proceed at night. When the order of setting off was given, I walked till I was past the army to answer the call of nature. After finishing I returned (to the camp) to depart (with the others) and suddenly realized that my necklace over my chest was missing. So, I returned to look for it and was delayed because of that. The people who used to carry me on the camel, came to my Howdah and put it on the back of the camel, thinking that I was in it, as, at that time, women were light in weight, and thin and lean, and did not use to eat much. So, those people did not feel the difference in the heaviness of the Howdah while lifting it, and they put it over the camel. At that time I was a young lady. They set the camel moving and proceeded on. I found my necklace after the army had gone, and came to their camp to find nobody. So, I went to the place where I used to stay, thinking that they would discover my absence and come back in my search. While in that state, I felt sleepy and slept. Safwan bin Muattal As-Sulami Adh-Dhakwani was behind the army and reached my abode in the morning. When he saw a sleeping person, he came to me, and he used to see me before veiling. So, I got up when I heard him saying, \"Inna lil-lah-wa inn a ilaihi rajiun (We are for Allah, and we will return to Him).\" He made his camel knell down. He got down from his camel, and put his leg on the front legs of the camel and then I rode and sat over it. Safwan set out walking, leading the camel by the rope till we reached the army who had halted to take rest at midday. Then whoever was meant for destruction, fell into destruction, (some people accused me falsely) and the leader of the false accusers was `Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul. After that we returned to Medina, and I became ill for one month while the people were spreading the forged statements of the false accusers. I was feeling during my ailment as if I were not receiving the usual kindness from the Prophet which I used to receive from him when I got sick. But he would come, greet and say, How is that (girl)? I did not know anything of what was going on till I recovered from my ailment and went out with Um Mistah to the Manasi where we used to answer the call of nature, and we used not to go to answer the call of nature except from night to night and that was before we had lavatories near to our houses. And this habit of ours was similar to the habit of the old Arabs in the open country (or away from houses). So. I and Um Mistah bint Ruhm went out walking. Um Mistah stumbled because of her long dress and on that she said, Let Mistah be ruined. I said, You are saying a bad word. Why are you abusing a man who took part in (the battle of) Badr? She said, O Hanata (you there) didnt you hear what they said? Then she told me the rumors of the false accusers. My sickness was aggravated, and when I returned home, Allahs Apostle came to me, and after greeting he said, How is that (girl)? I requested him to allow me to go to my parents. I wanted then to be sure of the news through them I Allahs Apostle allowed me, and I went to my parents and asked my mother, What are the people talking about? She said, O my daughter! Dont worry much about this matter. By Allah, never is there a charming woman loved by her husband who has other wives, but the women would forge false news about her. I said, Glorified be Allah! Are the people really taking of this matter? That night I kept on weeping and could not sleep till morning. In the morning Allahs Apostle called `Ali bin Abu Talib and Usama bin Zaid when he saw the Divine Inspiration delayed, to consul them about divorcing his wife (i.e. `Aisha). Usama bin Zaid said what he knew of the good reputation of his wives and added, O Allahs Apostle! Keep you wife, for, by Allah, we know nothing about her but good. `Ali bin Abu Talib said, O Allahs Apostle! Allah has no imposed restrictions on you, and there are many women other than she, yet you may ask the woman-servant who will tell you the truth. On that Allahs Apostle called Buraira and said, O Burair. Did you ever see anything which roused your suspicions about her? Buraira said, No, by Allah Who has sent you with the Truth, I have never seen in her anything faulty except that she is a girl of immature age, who sometimes sleeps and leaves the dough for the goats to eat. On that day Allahs Apostle ascended the pulpit and requested that somebody support him in punishing `Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul. Allahs Apostle said, Who will support me to punish that person (`Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul) who has hurt me by slandering the reputation of my family? By Allah, I know nothing about my family but good, and they have accused a person about whom I know nothing except good, and he never entered my house except in my company. Sa`d bin Mu`adh got up and said, O Allahs Apostle! by Allah, I will relieve you from him. If that man is from the tribe of the Aus, then we will chop his head off, and if he is from our brothers, the Khazraj, then order us, and we will fulfill your order. On that Sa`d bin Ubada, the chief of the Khazraj and before this incident, he had been a pious man, got up, motivated by his zeal for his tribe and said, By Allah, you have told a lie; you cannot kill him, and you will never be able to kill him. On that Usaid bin Al-Hadir got up and said (to Sa`d bin Ubada), By Allah! you are a liar. By Allah, we will kill him; and you are a hypocrite, defending the hypocrites. On this the two tribes of Aus and Khazraj got excited and were about to fight each other, while Allahs Apostle was standing on the pulpit. He got down and quieted them till they became silent and he kept quiet. On that day I kept on weeping so much so that neither did my tears stop, nor could I sleep. In the morning my parents were with me and I had wept for two nights and a day, till I thought my liver would burst from weeping. While they were sitting with me and I was weeping, an Ansari woman asked my permission to enter, and I allowed her to come in. She sat down and started weeping with me. While we were in this state, Allahs Apostle came and sat down and he had never sat with me since the day they forged the accusation. No revelation regarding my case came to him for a month. He recited Tashah-hud (i.e. None has the right to be worshipped but Allah and Muhammad is His Apostle) and then said, O `Aisha! I have been informed such-and-such about you; if you are innocent, then Allah will soon reveal your innocence, and if you have committed a sin, then repent to Allah and ask Him to forgive you, for when a person confesses his sin and asks Allah for forgiveness, Allah accepts his repentance. When Allahs Apostle finished his speech my tears ceased completely and there remained not even a single drop of it. I requested my father to reply to Allahs Apostle on my behalf. My father said, By Allah, I do not know what to say to Allahs Apostle. I said to my mother, Talk to Allahs Apostle on my behalf. She said, By Allah, I do not know what to say to Allahs Apostle. I was a young girl and did not have much knowledge of the Quran. I said. I know, by Allah, that you have listened to what people are saying and that has been planted in your minds and you have taken it as a truth. Now, if I told you that I am innocent and Allah knows that I am innocent, you would not believe me and if I confessed to you falsely that I am guilty, and Allah knows that I am innocent you would believe me. By Allah, I dont compare my situation with you except to the situation of Josephs father (i.e. Jacob) who said, So (for me) patience is most fitting against that which you assert and it is Allah (Alone) whose help can be sought. Then I turned to the other side of my bed hoping that Allah would prove my innocence. By Allah I never thought that Allah would reveal Divine Inspiration in my case, as I considered myself too inferior to be talked of in the Holy Quran. I had hoped that Allahs Apostle might have a dream in which Allah would prove my innocence. By Allah, Allahs Apostle had not got up and nobody had left the house before the Divine Inspiration came to Allahs Apostle. So, there overtook him the same state which used to overtake him, (when he used to have, on being inspired divinely). He was sweating so much so that the drops of the sweat were dropping like pearls though it was a (cold) wintry day. When that state of Allahs Apostle was over, he was smiling and the first word he said, `Aisha! Thank Allah, for Allah has declared your innocence. My mother told me to go to Allahs Apostle . I replied, By Allah I will not go to him and will not thank but Allah. So Allah revealed: \"Verily! They who spread the slander are a gang among you . . .\" (24.11) When Allah gave the declaration of my Innocence, Abu Bakr, who used to provide for Mistah bin Uthatha for he was his relative, said, By Allah, I will never provide Mistah with anything because of what he said about Aisha. But Allah later revealed: -- \"And let not those who are good and wealthy among you swear not to help their kinsmen, those in need and those who left their homes in Allahs Cause. Let them forgive and overlook. Do you not wish that Allah should forgive you? Verily! Allah is Oft-forgiving, Most Merciful.\" (24.22) After that Abu Bakr said, Yes ! By Allah! I like that Allah should forgive me, and resumed helping Mistah whom he used to help before. Allahs Apostle also asked Zainab bint Jahsh (i.e. the Prophets wife about me saying, What do you know and what did you see? She replied, O Allahs Apostle! I refrain to claim hearing or seeing what I have not heard or seen. By Allah, I know nothing except goodness about Aisha.\" Aisha further added \"Zainab was competing with me (in her beauty and the Prophets love), yet Allah protected her (from being malicious), for she had piety.\"<D>Anas bin Malik narrated that :the Messenger of Allah said: The acceptable Wudu is with two Ratils of water.\"<D>(For they, if they) the Magians (should come to know of you, will stone you) kill you (or turn you back to their religion) Zoroastrianism; (then ye will never prosper) you will never escape from Allahs punishment.<D>(That ye serve none) you confess the divine Oneness of none, (save Allah. Lo! I fear for you) I know that there shall come upon you if you do not believe (the retribution of a painful Day) which is drowning.<D>(But he was not long in coming, and he said: I have found out (a thing) that thou apprehendest not) O king! I reached a place that you have not reached and have come to know that which you do not, (and I come unto thee from Sheba) the city of Sheba (with sure tidings) with an amazing, true information.", "Generated_Answer": "<think>\nOkay, so I've been dealing with this really tough situation for the past four months. I have OCD, and it's making my religious practices, especially wudu and namaz, extremely challenging. Let me try to break this down and see if I can figure out a way to approach it.\n\nFirst, I know that OCD makes me have intrusive thoughts, and these thoughts are really distressing. They often involve things that I find unacceptable or immoral, which is why they're so bothersome. The problem is, every time I try to avoid these thoughts, they seem to come back even stronger. It's like the more I try to push them away, the more they linger in my mind.\n\nNow, when it comes to wudu, which is the Islamic procedure for washing parts of the body before prayer, I'm really struggling. I feel like I can't be sure whether I've had any thoughts that would invalidate my wudu. If I have a bad thought, I'm worried that it might cause some kind of discharge, which I believe would require me to redo wudu. But the thing is, I can't actually tell if there's any discharge happening. It's all in my head, and that uncertainty is paralyzing me.\n\nBecause of this, I end up washing myself and doing wudu five times a day. Each time I perform wudu, I feel like I'm starting fresh, but the cycle just repeats itself. My skin is paying the price for all this water exposure. It's become really dry, and no matter how much lotion I use, it doesn't seem to help. I'm going through lotion quickly, and my parents are getting upset with me for using so much water and spending a lot of time in the bathroom. They don't understand what I'm going through, and that's adding to my stress.\n\nI've heard that if you're not 100% certain that your wudu has broken, then you don't need to renew it. But the problem is, I'm never sure. I'm always doubting myself, and that doubt is making me feel like I have to keep redoing wudu just in case. I'm terrified that if I don't, my prayers won't count, and that's a huge fear for me.\n\nThis is taking a toll on my mental health. I'm feeling really depressed about the whole situation. I can't concentrate on my prayers because I'm always worrying about whether I've done wudu correctly. It's like I'm"}
