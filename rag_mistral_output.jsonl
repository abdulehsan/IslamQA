However, it ultimately depends on the specific circumstances and the level of contamination.\n\nIn general, it is best to avoid consuming food that has been in contact with food that you are not sure about, as it could potentially be harmful to your health. Additionally, it is always a good idea to wash your hands thoroughly after handling food, especially if you are unsure about its safety.\n\nIt is also worth noting that in Islam, it is generally not recommended to consume food that has been in contact with non-Muslims, as it could potentially be contaminated with impurities or harmful substances. However, this is not always possible to avoid, and in such cases, it is best to exercise caution and take necessary precautions to ensure the safety of your food.", "Retrieved": ["In their hearts is a disease.

{"Question": "I am currently working as an Assistant Manager in a cinema. Im finding it very hard to protect my Islam and good character in this job. There is free mixing, alcohol is sold, I am frequently locked in a room with a women  during end of day cash reconciliation and the hours (shift work) make it very hard for me to pray. The reason I took this job was so that my parents could stop working. Al-Hamdo- Lillah I was able to take the burden of work off my Dad. Prior to my getting this job his health had been deteriorating rapidly  he has high blood pressure (he was a bus driver). Soon he will go to Pakistan and stay there for a while  something which I hope will be better for his health and his Islam. At my current cinema I am treated very badly by my boss. However I will soon move to another cinema where Im hoping it will be easier for me to protect myself  most cinemas have a majority of male supervisors and my boss may be more lenient. However there will still be alcohol and the hours will still be long. I currently pray at work  this is very difficult as I have to be available all the time throughout my shift. Things will be easier if I stop doing this and read Kaza when I get home  something which my family are putting pressure on me about. Is there any way I can justify doing this? I dont want to leave because then my Dad will have to start work again in which case his Islam and his health will suffer. Is it ok if I stay in this job until I find a new one  bearing in mind the economic situation and the fact that while working I dont have much time for job seeking.

The amount of dead skin was considerable and I am doubtful and irritated by not knowing where it came from for sure. 2. I use a tap in Wudoo and I used a lot of water blasting it on my feet, and I remember rubbing as well, so can I assume that this amount of water is sufficient to penetrate the dead skin and reach the surface of my foot? ? --T--", "Answer": "Answer:\n\n1. It is possible that the dead skin came from the pummelstone you used on your feet before performing Wudoo. It is also possible that it came from the slippers you wore during Wudoo. To determine the source of the dead skin, you can try washing your feet with a soft brush or using a pummelstone again to see if the dead skin comes off.\n2. The amount of water used in Wudoo should be sufficient to penetrate the dead skin and reach the surface of your foot.

It is not necessary to feel or see anything on the skin after wudoo, as long as the body has been properly washed.\n\nHowever, if you do notice something on your skin after wudoo, it is important to investigate it further. For example, if you notice loose bits on your nose or eye secretions, it is possible that these are due to dryness or irritation, and may not necessarily invalidate your wudoo. In this case, you can try using a moisturizer or eye drops to alleviate the issue.\n\nOn the other hand, if you notice something on your skin that you are unsure about, it is best to err on the side of caution and repeat the wudoo. This will ensure that your body is properly purified and that any doubts or concerns are addressed.\n\nIt is also important to remember that wudoo is not just about appearance, but also about intention and sincerity.

The purpose of ihram purdah is to cover the head and chest, and to prevent any physical contact with the face.\n\nRegarding the question about the sin of purdah touching the face, it is important to note that the rules of ihram are based on the teachings of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) and the Companions, and have been passed down through the generations. While it is true that some people may have different opinions about the rules of ihram, it is ultimately up to each individual to follow the guidance of the scholars and the teachings of Islam.\n\nAs for the dum, it is a small amount of money that is paid by women who wear the ihram purdah. The dum is a symbol of the woman's commitment to the rules of ihram and is intended to compensate for any inconvenience that may be caused to others by the woman's presence in the mosque.\n\nRegarding purdah in Haram Sharief whilst in ihraam, it is important to note that the rules of ihram apply to all areas of the mosque, including the Haram Sharief. Women who are in ihraam are required to wear the ihram purdah at all times, and to avoid any physical contact with their faces. This includes avoiding touching their faces with their hands or any other objects, as well as avoiding any physical contact with others.\n\nIt is also important to note that women who are in ihraam are not allowed to perform any physical acts of worship, such as praying or performing ablution, in the Haram Sharief. Instead, they are required to perform these acts in a designated area outside of the Haram Sharief.\n\nOverall, it is important for women who are in ihraam to follow the guidance of the scholars and the teachings of Islam, and to be mindful of the rules of ihram at all times.", "Retrieved": ["O believers!

Or is she feeling like she doesn't need it anymore because she's feeling more confident without it?\n\nOnce you have a better understanding of her feelings, you could try to offer some reassurance and support. For example, you could remind her that wearing a scarf can be a personal choice and that it doesn't define her as a person. You could also encourage her to trust her own instincts and do what feels right for her.\n\nIt's also important to remember that it's okay for your friend to change her mind or feel differently about something.

However, it is important to ensure that all droplets are removed before putting the toilet paper back down. This is because leaving droplets on the toilet paper can cause it to become wet and slippery, which can lead to accidents and injuries.\n\nRegarding the question about whether this makes your underwear napaak, it is unlikely that a small amount of droplets on the toilet paper would cause your underwear to become dirty or unclean. However, it is always a good idea to be clean and hygienic, so it is best to wipe the toilet paper thoroughly and dispose of it properly.\n\nAs for making up for the musallis salaah that was read behind you, it is important to remember that salaah is a personal act of worship and it is not necessary to make up for missed salaah if you are not aware of it. However, if you are aware of missed salaah, it is recommended to make it up as soon as possible. You can make up for missed salaah by performing extra salaah or by donating to charity.

I took him to the Musjid to see how we offer Salaah etc. He says he believes in Monotheism, but now hes got one question. Why could Islam unconditionally stop/forbid Alcohol, while it only regulated Slavery, and did not forbid it? I couldnt answer him, I replied by saying that it was eventually forbidden, and it was over a period of time, so that the people will willingly accept and obey, he was however not satisfied with my answer. Is there anything wrong in what I said? and please provide an answer. ? --T--", "Answer": "Answer:\n\nYour answer is partially correct, but it could have been more comprehensive. The reason why Islam unconditionally forbids alcohol is because it is a substance that can lead to addiction, which can negatively affect one's physical and mental health. Additionally, alcohol can lead to moral decay and social problems.\n\nOn the other hand, slavery was a social and economic system that was prevalent in many societies at the time of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him). While Islam did not condone slavery, it did not initially forbid it either. However, over time, the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) gradually abolished slavery and encouraged the freeing of slaves.\n\nIt is important to note that the reasons for the prohibition of alcohol and the gradual abolition of slavery are not mutually exclusive. Both were based on the principles of compassion, justice, and the well-being of society as a whole.\n\nIn summary, while there may be some similarities between the reasons for the prohibition of alcohol and the gradual abolition of slavery, it is important to understand the specific context and historical background of each issue.", "Retrieved": ["Indeed, those who disbelieved (by concealing the truth), and left this world whilst they were disbelievers, upon them is the curse of Allah and of the angels and of all mankind.", "It is just not conceivable that any Prophet would conceal anything.

{"Question": "I have been wearing the hijab for over two years now Alhamdullilah and I am noticing that I am losing alot of hair. I feel I am doing something wrong. Is there a specific type of cloth that a hijab should be made out of to reduce this problem? ? --T--", "Answer": "Answer:\n\nIt is common for people to experience hair loss when wearing a hijab, especially if they are not using the right type of cloth. The fabric of the hijab can affect the amount of air that reaches your scalp, which can lead to hair loss.\n\nTo reduce this problem, it is recommended to use a breathable fabric such as cotton or linen. These fabrics allow air to circulate around your scalp, which can help to prevent hair loss. Additionally, it is important to keep your hijab clean and dry, as dirty or damp fabric can trap moisture and lead to hair loss.\n\nIt is also important to note that hair loss can be caused by a variety of factors, including genetics, stress, and poor nutrition. If you are experiencing significant hair loss, it may be helpful to speak with a healthcare professional to determine the underlying cause and develop a treatment plan.", "Retrieved": ["Many of the People of the Book desire to turn you back to disbelief after you have believed because of the jealousy they have in their hearts, despite the fact that the truth has become evident to them.

{"Question": "Q: I have been living with a lot of hard ship for the past 4 months. I have OCD and I cant control my thoughts. The more I try to avoid bad thoughts the more they come into my head. So every time before namaz I have to wash myself and do wudu because I am not sure if I had dirty thoughts that would cause vaginal discharge and having OCD makes this worse because I can never tell the difference. So I always have to wash myself and do wudu 5 times a day. I can never keep my wudu because I cant stop dirty/bad thoughts from coming in my mind and even if they dont come, if I try to remember if I have broken my wudu or not then they come into my mind and I think my wudu is broken. I can never tell if there is discharge with the thoughts but it is getting to be very stressful. I spend so much time doing wudu my skin is getting ruined from all the water. It is so dry. I use a lot of lotion and even that is getting finished very quickly but it is still very dry. I dont know what to do. I cant control my thoughts and I can never know if my wudu has broken or not. So if I come home late from something and there is still time to pray I go and make wudu and pray but then the more I try to avoid bad thoughts the more they come and bother me. I am trying to get better but treating OCD is very hard so an hour later I have to do wudu all over again. This becomes a big problem where I have to leave somewhere right after namaz because it takes me so long to do wudu and get namaz done. It is causing me a lot of mental stress. I am so tired of doing all this. 1) What do I do in this situation? I really need advice. My parents get very upset with me for using so much water and being in the bathroom for so long but I dont know what to do. I have heard that if you are not 100% certain that your wudu has broken then you dont have to renew it but I am never sure but I feel like if I dont do wudu every time then what if my namaaz doesnt count? I dont know what to do. I am very depressed about this please help. ? --T--", "Answer": "Answer: \n\nDear T,\n\nI'm sorry to hear that you're going through such a difficult time with your OCD and the impact it's having on your daily life. It's important to remember that OCD is a mental health condition that requires professional treatment and support.\n\nIn terms of your specific situation, it's understandable that you feel overwhelmed and unsure about your wudu practices. However, it's important to remember that wudu is not just about physical cleanliness, but also about mental and spiritual purification. If you're struggling with bad thoughts and can't control them, it's important to seek help from a mental health professional who specializes in OCD.\n\nIn the meantime, here are some practical tips that may help:\n\n1. Set a specific time for wudu: Instead of doing wudu every time you have a bad thought, set a specific time for wudu each day. This can help you manage your time more effectively and reduce the stress of constantly worrying about your wudu.\n2. Use a timer: If you're unsure about how long to spend doing wudu, use a timer to help you stay focused and avoid getting lost in your thoughts.\n3. Practice relaxation techniques: Deep breathing, meditation, and other relaxation techniques can help you manage your anxiety and reduce the impact of bad thoughts.\n4. Seek support: Talk to a trusted friend or family member about your struggles with OCD and ask for their support. You may also want to consider joining a support group for people with OCD.\n\nRemember, managing OCD is a process and it takes time and effort.
