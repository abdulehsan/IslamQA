{"Question": "Q: A member of my family ordered a pizza from a takeaway which I do not trust as there is a rumour that the chicken could be dodgy, anyway one of the pizza slices touched my home cooked food which I was eating so my question is will this make my food haraam because I ate the roti which the slice touched. ? --T--", "Answer": "It will not be haraam.

Our journey food was dates, and Abu Ubaida kept on giving us our daily ration from it little by little (piecemeal) till it decreased to such an extent that we did not receive except a date each.\" I asked (Jabir), \"How could one date benefit you?\" He said, \"We came to know its value when even that finished.\" Jabir added, \"Then we reached the sea (coast) where we found a fish like a small mountain. The people (i.e. troops) ate of it for 18 nights (i.e. days).

We marched on till we reached a place where our food was about to finish. Abu- Ubaida ordered us to collect all the journey food and it was collected. My (our) journey food was dates. Abu Ubaida kept on giving us our daily ration in small amounts from it, till it was exhausted. The share of everyone of us used to be one date only.\" I said, \"How could one date benefit you?\" Jabir replied, \"We came to know its value when even that too finished.\" Jabir added, \"When we reached the sea-shore, we saw a huge fish which was like a small mountain. The army ate from it for eighteen days. Then Abu Ubaida ordered that two of its ribs be fixed and they were fixed in the ground.

Eat from one spot, for indeed the food is one. Then a plate containing various dried dates\" - or fresh dates - Ubaidullah (a narrator) was not sure. He said: \"I began eating what was in front of me, while the hand of the Messenger of Allah () roamed about the plate. He said: O Ikrash! Eat from wherever you like, for indeed it is not all from the same variety.

", "Generated_Answer": "**Answer:**\n\nIn Islam, the permissibility (halal) or impermissibility (haram) of food depends on several factors. Here’s a breakdown of the issue you described:\n\n---\n\n### 1. **Determining if the Pizza is Haram:**\n   - If the chicken on the pizza is confirmed to be non-halal (e.g., not slaughtered Islamically, or mixed with haram ingredients), then the pizza itself would be impermissible to consume.\n   - However, if the rumor about the chicken being \"dodgy\" is unverified, the default assumption is that food is halal unless proven otherwise. Islam encourages avoiding unnecessary suspicion (Quran 49:12).\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Does Touching the Roti Make It Haram?**\n   - **Liquid vs. Dry Contact**:  \n     - If the haram component (e.g., chicken, sauce) was **moist** and transferred visibly to the roti, the affected part of the roti would be considered impure (najis) and should be discarded.\n     - If both the pizza and roti were **dry**, and no visible residue transferred, the roti generally remains pure and permissible to eat. Islamic rulings emphasize that mere dry contact does not transmit impurity (based on the principle: \"Dryness purifies,\" as cited by many scholars).\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Unintentional Contact and Forgiveness:**\n   - If the contact was accidental and minimal, and you consumed the roti unknowingly, this is excusable. Allah is Merciful and does not hold people accountable for unintentional mistakes (Quran 2:173, 5:3).  \n   - The Prophet ﷺ said: *\"Allah has forgiven my Ummah for what occurs within themselves, as long as it is not acted upon or spoken.\"* (Bukhari, Muslim).\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Practical Steps to Take:**\n   - **If contamination is certain**: Cut off or avoid the portion of the roti that directly touched the haram ingredient.\n   - **If doubtful**:  \n     - Avoid overcomplicating matters. Scholars advise against excessive doubt (waswasah) in matters of purity.  \n     - Wash the affected area if possible, and continue eating the rest of the food.  \n     - In the future, keep halal and haram foods separate to prevent such concerns.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Ruling:**\nYour roti is **not haram** in this scenario, as:\n- The pizza’s haram status is unconfirmed (relying on rumors is insufficient).\n- Dry contact does not typically transmit impurity.\n- Accidental minor contact is pardoned in Islam.\n\n**Action to Take:**  \nEat the roti without worry, but verify food sources in the future to ensure they are halal. If the pizza’s haram status is confirmed, simply avoid direct contact between halal and haram foods going forward.\n\n*May Allah reward you for your mindfulness in seeking halal sustenance.*"}
{"Question": "When you do ghusl and you have to make sure all your hair or skin is wet, does this mean that you have to maintain its wetness till the end of the ghusl? ? --T--", "Answer": "Assalamu alaykum Yes, one must indeed wash all of the hairs on ones body to the roots. One should be sure to avoid misgivings (waswasa) regarding this. Please look up baseless misgivings and doubts in the SunniPath archives (at www.SunniPath.com) in this regard. One is not obliged to perform the ritual bath (ghusl) in one sitting. The ghusl is valid as long as the entirety of ones body is washed, regardless of whether the whole body is wet by the end or whether some parts are dry and others wet. It is however a confirmed sunna to perform it from beginning to end without an unnecessarily prolonged delay", "Document": "It was narrated that Aishah said:\"When the Messenger of Allah () performed Ghusl from Janabah, he would wash his hands, then perform Wudu as for prayer, then he would perform Ghusl, then run his fingers through his hair to be sure that the water pour water over his head three times, then wash the rest of his body.\"<D>Narrated Abu Huraira:The Prophet (or Abul Qasim) said, \"While a man was walking, clad in a two-piece garment and proud of himself with his hair well-combed, suddenly Allah made him sink into the earth and he will go on sinking into it till the Day of Resurrection.<D>Narrated Hisham bin `Urwa:(on the authority of his father) `Aisha said, \"Whenever Allahs Apostle took the bath of Janaba, he cleaned his hands and performed ablution like that for prayer and then took a bath and rubbed his hair, till he felt that the whole skin of the head had become wet, then he would pour water thrice and wash the rest of the body.\" `Aisha further said, \"I and Allahs Apostle used to take a bath from a single water container, from which we took water simultaneously.\"<D>(Or (bethink thee) the like of him who, passing by a township) He says: do you not know about Uzayr Ibn Shurahya who passed by the township of Dayr Hiraql (which had fallen into utter ruin, exclaimed: How shall Allah give this township life after its death) How can Allah bring the people of this township back to life after their death? (So Allah made him die) right on the spot (a hundred years, then brought him back to life) at the end of the day. (He) Allah (said: How long hast thou tarried) O Uzayr? (He said: I have tarried for aday) and then looked at the sun still in the horizon and said (or part of a day. He) Allah (said: Nay, but thouhast tarried) you were dead (for a hundred years. Just look at thy food) figs and grapes (and drink) juice(which have not rotted! Look at thine ass!) look at the bones of your ass how white they look! (And, thatWe may make thee a token) a sign (to mankind) regarding the matter of bringing the dead to life, that they will be resurrected in the same state they died in, because Uzayr died young and was brought back to life as a young person. It is said that Allah made him a lesson for people, for he died when he was 40 years old and was brought back to life when his son was 120 years old, (look at the bones) the bones of your ass, (how We adjust them and then cover them with flesh!) after this. He then said: We will make grow on it nerves and veins, flesh, skin and hair and put the spirit in it. (And when (the matter) became clear untohim) how Allah gathers the bones, (he said: I know) I had known (that Allah is Able to do all things) of lifeand death. <D>(And the cattle) i.e. the camels (hath He created, whence ye have warm clothing) made of their skin (and uses) you drink their milk and use them as a means of transport, (and whereof ye eat) and you eat their meat.<D>(On honoured leaves) He says: the Quran is written on scrolls made of skin which are honoured in the sight of Allah", "Generated_Answer": "In Islamic jurisprudence (fiqh), the validity of ghusl (ritual bath) depends on ensuring **water reaches every part of the body**, including the skin, hair (including roots), and nails. The key ruling is that **each part must be washed at least once**, but it is **not required** to maintain the wetness of the hair or skin until the end of the ghusl. If water reaches a part of the body and it subsequently dries before you complete the ghusl, the ghusl remains valid.\n\n### Key Points:\n1. **Coverage Matters, Not Continuous Wetness**:  \n   The obligation is fulfilled once water flows over every part of the body. If a part dries after being washed (e.g., due to heat or delay), this does not invalidate the ghusl, as long as it was properly washed.\n\n2. **Practical Guidance**:  \n   To avoid doubt or missing any area, some scholars recommend:  \n   - Beginning with the head/face and working downward to ensure thorough washing.  \n   - Rubbing the body/hair lightly to ensure water penetrates (e.g., thick hair, braids, or skin folds).  \n   - Avoiding unnecessary delays during ghusl to minimize drying before completion.\n\n3. **Schools of Thought**:  \n   - **Hanafi and Hanbali Schools**: Explicitly state that drying after washing does not affect validity.  \n   - **Shafi’i and Maliki Schools**: Emphasize thorough washing but do not require continuous wetness.  \n\n4. **Exceptions**:  \n   - If an area was **not washed at all**, the ghusl is invalid.  \n   - If something prevents water from reaching the skin/hair (e.g., oil, wax, tight hairstyles), it must be removed or loosened.\n\n### Steps of Valid Ghusl:\n1. **Intention (niyyah)** in the heart.  \n2. Wash hands and private parts.  \n3. Perform a basic wudu (optional in some schools).  \n4. Pour water over the entire body, ensuring it flows over every part (hair, skin, etc.), starting with the head/right side.  \n\n### Summary:  \nYou do **not** need to keep your hair or skin wet until the end of ghusl. The obligation is fulfilled once water has reached every part of the body, even if it dries afterward. Focus on thorough washing rather than maintaining wetness."}
{"Question": "I am currently working as an Assistant Manager in a cinema. Im finding it very hard to protect my Islam and good character in this job. There is free mixing, alcohol is sold, I am frequently locked in a room with a women  during end of day cash reconciliation and the hours (shift work) make it very hard for me to pray. The reason I took this job was so that my parents could stop working. Al-Hamdo- Lillah I was able to take the burden of work off my Dad. Prior to my getting this job his health had been deteriorating rapidly  he has high blood pressure (he was a bus driver). Soon he will go to Pakistan and stay there for a while  something which I hope will be better for his health and his Islam. At my current cinema I am treated very badly by my boss. However I will soon move to another cinema where Im hoping it will be easier for me to protect myself  most cinemas have a majority of male supervisors and my boss may be more lenient. However there will still be alcohol and the hours will still be long. I currently pray at work  this is very difficult as I have to be available all the time throughout my shift. Things will be easier if I stop doing this and read Kaza when I get home  something which my family are putting pressure on me about. Is there any way I can justify doing this? I dont want to leave because then my Dad will have to start work again in which case his Islam and his health will suffer. Is it ok if I stay in this job until I find a new one  bearing in mind the economic situation and the fact that while working I dont have much time for job seeking. Also it is very difficult to find a truly Halal job in a non-Muslim country  I may be unemployed for years if I leave. Im feeling very trapped ? --T--", "Answer": "Assalamu alaykum, Dear brother, You have to understand that Allah MOST HIGH is the provider and sustainer. Engaging in haram activities to earn rizq deprives that rizq of barakah. You must try to find a new job immediately. Serving alcohol, or being associated with it in any way is haraam. According to a hadith, all of the people associate with alcohol are cursed by Allah MOST HIGH.Narrated Jabir bin Abdullah: I heard Allahs Messenger, in the year of the Conquest of Mecca, saying, Allah and His Messenger made illegal the trade of alcohol, dead animals, pigs and idols. The people asked, O Allahs Messenger! What about the fat of dead animals, for it was used for greasing the boats and the hides; and people use it for lights? He said, No, it is illegal. Allahs Messenger further said, May Allah curse the Jews, for Allah made the fat (of animals) illegal for them, yet they melted the fat and sold it and ate its price.Ibn Abbas (Allah be pleased with him) reported: This news reached Umar that Samura had sold wine, whereupon he said: May Allah destroy Samura; does he not know that Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: Let there be the curse of Allah upon the Jews that fat was declared forbidden for them, but they melted it and then sold it?>From the way that you write, it seems that you are from England. I do know that in England there is a very good social security system that helps unemployed people. If this is not the case, continue to work there until you find more work, then leave the job.

Completed memorization of Quran at 16, then went on to complete the alim course. All education was conducted in the UK, at the Institute of Islamic Education, Dewsbury. Studies totalled 12 years.After graduating in 1994, was imam in Manchester, England, for one year. Then I moved to the USA, and have been an imam at various Islamic Centers.Currently Imam and teacher at the Islamic Community of Tampa Bay, Florida", "Document": "Narrated Aisha:(the wife of the Prophet) \"Whenever Allahs Apostle intended to go on a journey, he would draw lots amongst his wives and would take with him the one upon whom the lot fell. During a Ghazwa of his, he drew lots amongst us and the lot fell upon me, and I proceeded with him after Allah had decreed the use of the veil by women. I was carried in a Howdah (on the camel) and dismounted while still in it. When Allahs Apostle was through with his Ghazwa and returned home, and we approached the city of Medina, Allahs Apostle ordered us to proceed at night. When the order of setting off was given, I walked till I was past the army to answer the call of nature. After finishing I returned (to the camp) to depart (with the others) and suddenly realized that my necklace over my chest was missing. So, I returned to look for it and was delayed because of that. The people who used to carry me on the camel, came to my Howdah and put it on the back of the camel, thinking that I was in it, as, at that time, women were light in weight, and thin and lean, and did not use to eat much. So, those people did not feel the difference in the heaviness of the Howdah while lifting it, and they put it over the camel. At that time I was a young lady. They set the camel moving and proceeded on. I found my necklace after the army had gone, and came to their camp to find nobody. So, I went to the place where I used to stay, thinking that they would discover my absence and come back in my search. While in that state, I felt sleepy and slept. Safwan bin Muattal As-Sulami Adh-Dhakwani was behind the army and reached my abode in the morning. When he saw a sleeping person, he came to me, and he used to see me before veiling. So, I got up when I heard him saying, \"Inna lil-lah-wa inn a ilaihi rajiun (We are for Allah, and we will return to Him).\" He made his camel knell down. He got down from his camel, and put his leg on the front legs of the camel and then I rode and sat over it. Safwan set out walking, leading the camel by the rope till we reached the army who had halted to take rest at midday. Then whoever was meant for destruction, fell into destruction, (some people accused me falsely) and the leader of the false accusers was `Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul. After that we returned to Medina, and I became ill for one month while the people were spreading the forged statements of the false accusers. I was feeling during my ailment as if I were not receiving the usual kindness from the Prophet which I used to receive from him when I got sick. But he would come, greet and say, How is that (girl)? I did not know anything of what was going on till I recovered from my ailment and went out with Um Mistah to the Manasi where we used to answer the call of nature, and we used not to go to answer the call of nature except from night to night and that was before we had lavatories near to our houses. And this habit of ours was similar to the habit of the old Arabs in the open country (or away from houses). So. I and Um Mistah bint Ruhm went out walking. Um Mistah stumbled because of her long dress and on that she said, Let Mistah be ruined. I said, You are saying a bad word. Why are you abusing a man who took part in (the battle of) Badr? She said, O Hanata (you there) didnt you hear what they said? Then she told me the rumors of the false accusers. My sickness was aggravated, and when I returned home, Allahs Apostle came to me, and after greeting he said, How is that (girl)? I requested him to allow me to go to my parents. I wanted then to be sure of the news through them I Allahs Apostle allowed me, and I went to my parents and asked my mother, What are the people talking about? She said, O my daughter! Dont worry much about this matter. By Allah, never is there a charming woman loved by her husband who has other wives, but the women would forge false news about her. I said, Glorified be Allah! Are the people really taking of this matter? That night I kept on weeping and could not sleep till morning. In the morning Allahs Apostle called `Ali bin Abu Talib and Usama bin Zaid when he saw the Divine Inspiration delayed, to consul them about divorcing his wife (i.e. `Aisha). Usama bin Zaid said what he knew of the good reputation of his wives and added, O Allahs Apostle! Keep you wife, for, by Allah, we know nothing about her but good. `Ali bin Abu Talib said, O Allahs Apostle! Allah has no imposed restrictions on you, and there are many women other than she, yet you may ask the woman-servant who will tell you the truth. On that Allahs Apostle called Buraira and said, O Burair. Did you ever see anything which roused your suspicions about her? Buraira said, No, by Allah Who has sent you with the Truth, I have never seen in her anything faulty except that she is a girl of immature age, who sometimes sleeps and leaves the dough for the goats to eat. On that day Allahs Apostle ascended the pulpit and requested that somebody support him in punishing `Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul. Allahs Apostle said, Who will support me to punish that person (`Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul) who has hurt me by slandering the reputation of my family? By Allah, I know nothing about my family but good, and they have accused a person about whom I know nothing except good, and he never entered my house except in my company. Sa`d bin Mu`adh got up and said, O Allahs Apostle! by Allah, I will relieve you from him. If that man is from the tribe of the Aus, then we will chop his head off, and if he is from our brothers, the Khazraj, then order us, and we will fulfill your order. On that Sa`d bin Ubada, the chief of the Khazraj and before this incident, he had been a pious man, got up, motivated by his zeal for his tribe and said, By Allah, you have told a lie; you cannot kill him, and you will never be able to kill him. On that Usaid bin Al-Hadir got up and said (to Sa`d bin Ubada), By Allah! you are a liar. By Allah, we will kill him; and you are a hypocrite, defending the hypocrites. On this the two tribes of Aus and Khazraj got excited and were about to fight each other, while Allahs Apostle was standing on the pulpit. He got down and quieted them till they became silent and he kept quiet. On that day I kept on weeping so much so that neither did my tears stop, nor could I sleep. In the morning my parents were with me and I had wept for two nights and a day, till I thought my liver would burst from weeping. While they were sitting with me and I was weeping, an Ansari woman asked my permission to enter, and I allowed her to come in. She sat down and started weeping with me. While we were in this state, Allahs Apostle came and sat down and he had never sat with me since the day they forged the accusation. No revelation regarding my case came to him for a month. He recited Tashah-hud (i.e. None has the right to be worshipped but Allah and Muhammad is His Apostle) and then said, O `Aisha! I have been informed such-and-such about you; if you are innocent, then Allah will soon reveal your innocence, and if you have committed a sin, then repent to Allah and ask Him to forgive you, for when a person confesses his sin and asks Allah for forgiveness, Allah accepts his repentance. When Allahs Apostle finished his speech my tears ceased completely and there remained not even a single drop of it. I requested my father to reply to Allahs Apostle on my behalf. My father said, By Allah, I do not know what to say to Allahs Apostle. I said to my mother, Talk to Allahs Apostle on my behalf. She said, By Allah, I do not know what to say to Allahs Apostle. I was a young girl and did not have much knowledge of the Quran. I said. I know, by Allah, that you have listened to what people are saying and that has been planted in your minds and you have taken it as a truth. Now, if I told you that I am innocent and Allah knows that I am innocent, you would not believe me and if I confessed to you falsely that I am guilty, and Allah knows that I am innocent you would believe me. By Allah, I dont compare my situation with you except to the situation of Josephs father (i.e. Jacob) who said, So (for me) patience is most fitting against that which you assert and it is Allah (Alone) whose help can be sought. Then I turned to the other side of my bed hoping that Allah would prove my innocence. By Allah I never thought that Allah would reveal Divine Inspiration in my case, as I considered myself too inferior to be talked of in the Holy Quran. I had hoped that Allahs Apostle might have a dream in which Allah would prove my innocence. By Allah, Allahs Apostle had not got up and nobody had left the house before the Divine Inspiration came to Allahs Apostle. So, there overtook him the same state which used to overtake him, (when he used to have, on being inspired divinely). He was sweating so much so that the drops of the sweat were dropping like pearls though it was a (cold) wintry day. When that state of Allahs Apostle was over, he was smiling and the first word he said, `Aisha! Thank Allah, for Allah has declared your innocence. My mother told me to go to Allahs Apostle . I replied, By Allah I will not go to him and will not thank but Allah. So Allah revealed: \"Verily! They who spread the slander are a gang among you . . .\" (24.11) When Allah gave the declaration of my Innocence, Abu Bakr, who used to provide for Mistah bin Uthatha for he was his relative, said, By Allah, I will never provide Mistah with anything because of what he said about Aisha. But Allah later revealed: -- \"And let not those who are good and wealthy among you swear not to help their kinsmen, those in need and those who left their homes in Allahs Cause. Let them forgive and overlook. Do you not wish that Allah should forgive you? Verily! Allah is Oft-forgiving, Most Merciful.\" (24.22) After that Abu Bakr said, Yes ! By Allah! I like that Allah should forgive me, and resumed helping Mistah whom he used to help before. Allahs Apostle also asked Zainab bint Jahsh (i.e. the Prophets wife about me saying, What do you know and what did you see? She replied, O Allahs Apostle! I refrain to claim hearing or seeing what I have not heard or seen. By Allah, I know nothing except goodness about Aisha.\" Aisha further added \"Zainab was competing with me (in her beauty and the Prophets love), yet Allah protected her (from being malicious), for she had piety.\"<D>Narrated Sa`id bin Jubair:I said to Ibn `Abbas, \"Nauf Al-Bukah claims that Moses, the companion of Al-Khadir was not Moses (the prophet) of the children of Israel, but some other Moses.\" Ibn `Abbas said, \"Allahs enemy (i.e. Nauf) has told a lie. Ubai bin Ka`b told us that the Prophet said, Once Moses stood up and addressed Bani Israel. He was asked who was the most learned man amongst the people. He said, I. Allah admonished him as he did not attribute absolute knowledge to Him (Allah). So, Allah said to him, Yes, at the junction of the two seas there is a Slave of Mine who is more learned than you. Moses said, O my Lord! How can I meet him? Allah said, Take a fish and put it in a large basket and you will find him at the place where you will lose the fish. Moses took a fish and put it in a basket and proceeded along with his (servant) boy, Yusha` bin Noon, till they reached the rock where they laid their heads (i.e. lay down). Moses slept, and the fish, moving out of the basket, fell into the sea. It took its way into the sea (straight) as in a tunnel. Allah stopped the flow of water over the fish and it became like an arch (the Prophet pointed out this arch with his hands). They travelled the rest of the night, and the next day Moses said to his boy (servant), Give us our food, for indeed, we have suffered much fatigue in this journey of ours. Moses did not feel tired till he crossed that place which Allah had ordered him to seek after. His boy (servant) said to him, Do you know that when we were sitting near that rock, I forgot the fish, and none but Satan caused me to forget to tell (you) about it, and it took its course into the sea in an amazing way?. So there was a path for the fish and that astonished them. Moses said, That was what we were seeking after. So, both of them retraced their footsteps till they reached the rock. There they saw a man Lying covered with a garment. Moses greeted him and he replied saying, How do people greet each other in your land? Moses said, I am Moses. The man asked, Moses of Bani Israel? Moses said, Yes, I have come to you so that you may teach me from those things which Allah has taught you. He said, O Moses! I have some of the Knowledge of Allah which Allah has taught me, and which you do not know, while you have some of the Knowledge of Allah which Allah has taught you and which I do not know. Moses asked, May I follow you? He said, But you will not be able to remain patient with me for how can you be patient about things which you will not be able to understand? (Moses said, You will find me, if Allah so will, truly patient, and I will not disobey you in aught.) So, both of them set out walking along the sea-shore, a boat passed by them and they asked the crew of the boat to take them on board. The crew recognized Al-Khadir and so they took them on board without fare. When they were on board the boat, a sparrow came and stood on the edge of the boat and dipped its beak once or twice into the sea. Al-Khadir said to Moses, O Moses! My knowledge and your knowledge have not decreased Allahs Knowledge except as much as this sparrow has decreased the water of the sea with its beak. Then suddenly Al-Khadir took an adze and plucked a plank, and Moses did not notice it till he had plucked a plank with the adze. Moses said to him, What have you done? They took us on board charging us nothing; yet you I have intentionally made a hole in their boat so as to drown its passengers. Verily, you have done a dreadful thing. Al-Khadir replied, Did I not tell you that you would not be able to remain patient with me? Moses replied, Do not blame me for what I have forgotten, and do not be hard upon me for my fault. So the first excuse of Moses was that he had forgotten. When they had left the sea, they passed by a boy playing with other boys. Al-Khadir took hold of the boys head and plucked it with his hand like this. (Sufyan, the sub narrator pointed with his fingertips as if he was plucking some fruit.) Moses said to him, \"Have you killed an innocent person who has not killed any person? You have really done a horrible thing.\" Al-Khadir said, \"Did I not tell you that you could not remain patient with me? Moses said \"If I ask you about anything after this, dont accompany me. You have received an excuse from me. Then both of them went on till they came to some people of a village, and they asked its inhabitant for wood but they refused to entertain them as guests. Then they saw therein a wall which was just going to collapse (and Al Khadir repaired it just by touching it with his hands). (Sufyan, the sub-narrator, pointed with his hands, illustrating how Al-Khadir passed his hands over the wall upwards.) Moses said, \"These are the people whom we have called on, but they neither gave us food, nor entertained us as guests, yet you have repaired their wall. If you had wished, you could have taken wages for it.\" Al-Khadir said, \"This is the parting between you and me, and I shall tell you the explanation of those things on which you could not remain patient.\" The Prophet added, \"We wished that Moses could have remained patient by virtue of which Allah might have told us more about their story. (Sufyan the sub-narrator said that the Prophet said, \"May Allah bestow His Mercy on Moses! If he had remained patient, we would have been told further about their case.\")<D>Sa, id b. jubair reported that it was said to Ibn Abbas that Nauf al-Bikali was of the opinion that Moses who went in search of knowledge was not the Moses of Bani Israil. He said:Said, did you hear it from him? I said: Yes. Thereupon he said that Nauf had not stated the fact. Ubayy b. Kab narrated to us that he had heard Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: Moses had been delivering sermons to his people. And he made this remark: No person upon the earth has better knowledge than I or nothing better than mine. Thereupon Allah revealed to him: I know one who is better than you (in knowledge) or there is a person on the earth having more knowledge than you. Thereupon he said: My Lord, direct me to him. It was said to him: Keep a salted fish as a provision for journey. The place where that fish would be lost (there you will find that man). So he set forth and a young slave along with him until they came to a place Sakhra. but he did not find any clue. So he proceeded on and left that young man there. The fish began to stir in water and the water assumed the form of an ark over the fish. The young man said: I should meet Allahs Apostle (peace be upon him) and inform him, but he was made to forget and when they had gone beyond that place, he (Moses) said to the young man: Bring breakfast. We have been exhausted because of the journey, and he (Moses) was not exhausted until he had crossed that (particular) place (where he had) to meet Khadir, and the youth was reminded and said: Did you not see that as we reached Sakhra I forgot the fish and it is satan alone who has made me forgetful of it? It is strange that he has been able to find way in the ocean too. He said: This is what we sought for us. They returned retracing their steps, and he (his companion) pointed to him the location (where) the fish (had been lost). Moses began to search him there. He suddenly saw Khadir wrapped in a cloth and lying on his back. He said to him: As-Salamu-Alaikum. He removed the cloth from his face and said: Wa Alaikum-us-Salam! Who are you? He said: I am Moses. He said: Who Moses? He said: Moses Of Bani Israil. He said: What brought you here? He said: I have come so that you may teach me what you have been taught of righteousness. He said: You shall have to bear with me, and how can you have patience about a thing of which you have no comprehensive knowledge? You will not have patience when you see me doing a thing I have been ordered to do. He said: If Allah pleases, you will find me patient, nor shall I disobey you in aught. Khadir said: If you follow me, dont ask me about anything until I explain it to you. So they went on until they embarked upon a boat. He (Khadir) made a hole in that. Thereupon he (Moses) said: You have done this so that you may drown the persons sitting in the boat. You have done something grievous. Thereupon he said: Did I not tell you that you will not be able to bear with me? Thereupon he (Moses) said: Blame me not for what I forgot and be not hard upon me for what I did. (Khadir gave him another chance.) So they went on until they reached a place where boys were playing. He went to one of them and caught holdof one (apparently) at random and killed him. Moses (peace be upon him) felt agitated and said: You have killed an innocent person not guilty of slaying another. You have done something aboininable. Thereupon Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: May Allah have mercy upon us and Moses. Had he shown patience he would have seen wonderful things, but fear of blame, with respect to his companion, seized him and he said: If I ask anything after this, keep not company with me. You will then have a valid excuse in my case, and had he (Moses) shown patience he would have seen many wonderful things. He (the narrator) said: Whenever he (the Holy Prophet) made mention of any Prophet, he always said: May there be mercy of Allah upon us and upon my brother so and so. They, however, proceeded on until they came to the inhabitants of a village who were very miserly. They went to the meeting places and asked for hospitality but they refused to show any hospitality to them. They both found in that village a wall which was about to fall. He (Khadir) set it right. Thereupon he (Moses) said: If you so liked. you could get wages for it. Thereupon he said: This is the partince, of ways between me and you, and, taking hold of his cloth, he said: Now I will explain to you the real significance (of all these acts) for which you could not show patience. As for the boat, it belonged to the poor people working on the river and I intended to damage it for there was ahead of them (a king) who seized boats by force. (When he came) to catch hold of it he found it a damaged boat, so he spared it (and later on) it was set right with wood. So far as the boy is concerned, he has been, by very nature, an unbeliever, whereas his parents loved him very much. Had he grown up he would have involved them in wrongdoing and unbelief, so we wished that their Lord should give them in its place one better in purity and close to mercy. And as for the wall it belonged to two orphan boys in the city and there was beneath it a (treasure) belongin to them,... up to the last verse. This hadith has been transmitted on the authority of Abu Ishaq.<D>(And We shall turn unto the work they did) the good work they did in the life of this world (and make it) in the Hereafter (scattered motes) like scattered dust in the hooves of beasts; it is also said that this means: like tiny particles of dust which can be seen when, from a hole, light enters into a dark place, but these particles cannot be touched even though one can see them.<D>(Lo! thy Lord) O Muhammad (knoweth how thou keepest vigil sometimes nearly) less than (two thirds of the night) up to half of the night, (or (sometimes) half) and sometimes you keep vigil half of the night (or athird thereof) and you keep vigil a third of the night; it is also said this means: and sometimes less than half of the night, (as do a party of those with thee) and a group of believers with you who keep vigil of the night in prayer. (Allah measureth the night and the day) Allah knows the hours of the day and night. (He knoweth that ye count it not) i.e. keep track of the hours of the night; it is also said that this means: He knows you will not be able to persevere in that which you are commanded of prayer in the night, (and turneth unto you in mercy) and so He forgives you if you do not pray at night.

May Allah reward you immensely for your sincere intentions, your concern for your parents, and your determination to protect your faith despite these challenges. Your situation reflects a profound struggle between fulfilling a noble duty (supporting your parents) and safeguarding your Islamic obligations. Here is a balanced Islamic perspective to guide you:\n\n---\n\n### **1. Prayer (Salah): Non-Negotiable Priority**\nAllah says: *\"Guard your prayers, and [especially] the middle prayer, and stand before Allah in devotion.\"* (Qur'an 2:238).  \nPrayer is a fundamental pillar of Islam, and delaying it without a **valid shari’ah excuse** (e.g., life-threatening danger, uncontrollable circumstances) is not permissible.  \n- **Practical Steps:**  \n  - Negotiate with your employer for short breaks during prayer times (even 5–10 minutes). Frame it as a \"health break\" or \"mental reset\" if needed.  \n  - Use any quiet corner (storage room, office) to pray quickly. Combine prayers only if you meet the conditions for Jama’ (e.g., travel, genuine inability to pray on time).  \n  - Seek Allah’s help through dua: *\"O Allah, make easy for me what is difficult.\"*  \n- **Family Pressure:** Gently explain to your family that Salah is a direct obligation from Allah and neglecting it is not an option. Their concern for your job should not override this divine command.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Working in a Haram Environment: Assessing Permissibility**\n- **Alcohol Sales:** Working in a place that serves alcohol is **prohibited** if you are directly involved in its sale, handling, or supervision. If your role is indirect (e.g., managing staff who sell it), some scholars permit it out of necessity (darurah), but this requires strict conditions:  \n  - You avoid any direct involvement with alcohol (e.g., handling cash from its sale, supervising its distribution).  \n  - You actively seek alternative employment.  \n- **Free Mixing & Khalwa (Being Alone with a Non-Mahram):**  \n  - Khalwa is strictly forbidden. Demand that cash reconciliation be done in an open area or with a third person present. If refused, document your request in writing (email) to protect yourself professionally and Islamically.  \n- **Shift Work & Spiritual Strain:** While shift work itself is not haram, it becomes problematic if it consistently prevents you from fulfilling religious duties. Seek adjustments where possible.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Staying in the Job: Necessity (Darurah) vs. Alternatives**\nAllah says: *\"He has only forbidden to you dead animals, blood, the flesh of swine, and that which has been dedicated to other than Allah. But whoever is forced [by necessity]—neither desiring [it] nor transgressing [its limit]—then indeed, Allah is Forgiving and Merciful.\"* (Qur'an 2:173).  \n- **Permissibility Temporarily:**  \n  If leaving this job would cause **genuine harm** (e.g., your father’s health deteriorating, family falling into poverty), and no halal alternative is immediately available, staying may be temporarily allowed under the principle of **darurah** (necessity). However, this requires:  \n  - Minimizing involvement in haram (e.g., avoid alcohol-related tasks).  \n  - Continually seeking halal employment.  \n  - Repenting for any unavoidable violations and increasing good deeds to compensate.  \n- **Transition Plan:**  \n  - Use the upcoming move to the new cinema as an opportunity to negotiate better terms (e.g., prayer breaks, avoiding isolated interactions).  \n  - Dedicate time weekly to job-seeking (e.g., 1–2 hours daily after shifts, weekends). Leverage Muslim networks, Islamic job boards, or remote work options.  \n\n---\n\n### **4. Emotional and Spiritual Support**\n- **Trust in Allah’s Plan:** Remember that Allah tests those He loves (Sahih Bukhari 5645). Your struggle is a form of worship when endured for His sake.  \n- **Dua for Ease:**  \n  *\"رَبَّنَا آتِنَا مِن لَّدُنكَ رَحْمَةً وَهَيِّئْ لَنَا مِنْ أَمْرِنَا رَشَدًا\"*  \n  *\"Our Lord, grant us from Yourself mercy and prepare for us from our affair right guidance.\"* (Qur'an 18:10).  \n- **Community Support:** Reach out to local mosques or Islamic organizations for halal job leads or financial assistance to ease the transition.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Recommendations**\n1. **Stay for Now, but Strategize Your Exit:** Continue working until your father settles in Pakistan or until you secure another job. Use this time to build savings and explore alternatives.  \n2. **Set Boundaries Firmly:** Refuse tasks involving alcohol or khalwa, even if it risks conflict. Allah will reward your steadfastness.  \n3. **Maximize Good Deeds:** Offset the job’s negative impact with nightly prayers (Qiyam), frequent istighfar (seeking forgiveness), and charity.  \n4. **Explore Alternatives:** Consider jobs in logistics, administration, or remote work that align better with Islamic principles. Even a lower-paying halal job is better for your akhirah.  \n\n---\n\nRemember: Allah sees your struggle and will reward you for every hardship endured to protect your faith and family. As the Prophet ﷺ said: *\"Know that victory comes with patience, relief with affliction, and ease with hardship.\"* (Sunan al-Tirmidhi). Stay strong, make dua, and trust in His plan. May Allah grant you a halal rizq and ease your burdens. Ameen."}

Here is a breakdown:\n\n### 1. **Selling Coffins to Muslims**:\n   - **General Ruling**: Traditionally, Muslims are buried *without coffins*—wrapped only in a shroud (kafan) and placed directly in the ground. Thus, selling coffins to Muslims is **generally discouraged** if there is no valid need, as it may promote practices contrary to Islamic teachings (Sunnah).\n   - **Exceptions**: It becomes permissible only in cases of **necessity**, such as:\n     - Complying with local laws requiring coffins.\n     - Addressing specific soil or environmental conditions (e.g., waterlogged graves).\n   - **Conditions**: The seller should ensure the coffin is simple (without adornment) and avoid encouraging unnecessary innovations in burial practices.\n\n### 2. **Selling Coffins to Non-Muslims**:\n   - **Permissibility**: Selling coffins to non-Muslims is **allowed** because coffins are part of their customary burial practices. Islamic commercial principles permit transactions with non-Muslims as long as:\n     - The item sold is lawful (halal) and not inherently prohibited (e.g., not used for idolatry or rituals contradicting Islamic monotheism).\n     - The transaction is fair and free from deceit.\n   - **Scholarly View**: Most scholars agree that coffins are neutral objects (mubah) and do not fall under prohibited items, making their sale to non-Muslims permissible.\n\n### Key Considerations:\n- **Intent and Impact**: Sellers should avoid normalizing coffin use among Muslims unless necessary, to preserve Islamic burial traditions.\n- **Islamic Commercial Ethics**: All transactions must adhere to broader Islamic principles, such as honesty, transparency, and avoiding harm (darar).\n\n### Conclusion:\n- **Muslims**: Permissible only if **genuinely necessary** (e.g., legal or environmental reasons); otherwise discouraged.\n- **Non-Muslims**: **Permissible without restrictions**, as coffins align with their customary practices."}
{"Question": "Q: I have waswasahs, and alhamdulillaah I am doing better now in my salah after listening to the advice, but I still have problems with wudoo and I have an issue now about dead skin which I will elaborate about in shaa Allaah. OK so I used a pummelstone on my feet and I had dead skin on my feet then I wore my slippers and performed Wudoo washing my feet under the tap properly and then put my slippers back on and took them off to do salah. After salah I see flakes of dead skin on my feet so I look in my slipper and still see the dead skin from before inside of them so, I have 2 questions: 1. The amount of dead skin was considerable and I am doubtful and irritated by not knowing where it came from for sure. 2.

The wudhu is right. Dont pay attention to it.

This is acted upon according to most of the people of knowledge, they say that when the skin of a dead animal has been tanned then it has been made pure.[Abu Eisa said:] Ash-Shafii said: \"Any dead animals skin that is tanned, then it has been made pure, except for the dog and the pig.\" Some of the people of knowledge among the Companions of the Prophet () disliked skins of predators even when tanned, and this is the view of Abdullah bin Al-Mubarak, Ahmad and Ishaq, and they were firm about not wearing them and performing Salat in them. Ishaq bin Ibrahim said: \"The saying of the Prophet ():Any skin that is tanned, then it has been made pure only refers to the skins of animals whose meat is eaten.\" This is how it was explained by An-Nasr bin Shumail.<D>It was narraterd from Jabir bin Abdullah that, during the year of the Conquest, while he was in Makkah, he heard the Messenger of Allah say:\"Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, and His Messenger have forbidden the sale of alcohol, dead meat, pigs and idols.\" It was said to him: \"O Messenger of Allah, what do you think of their fat of dead animals, for it is used to caulk ships, it is daubed on animal skins, and people use it to light their lamps?\" He said: \"No, it is unlawful.\" Then the Messenger of Allah said: \"May Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, curse the Jews, for Allah forbade them the fat (of dead animals) but they rendered it, sold it, and consumed its price.\"<D>(And they used to say) in the life of the world: (When we are dead and have come) scattered (dust and)rotten (bones, shall we then, forsooth, be raised again) shall we then be given life again, <D>(They say: When we are dead and have become mere) scattered (dust and) decayed (bones, shall we then, forsooth, be raised again) after we have died? <D>(And Earth yieldeth up her burdens) and the Earth brings out her dead and treasures, ", "Generated_Answer": "Wa alaikum assalam wa rahmatullahi wa barakatuh. May Allah reward you for your efforts in overcoming waswas (whisperings) and striving to perfect your worship. Your concern reflects your desire to fulfill the obligations of wudoo correctly, and we ask Allah to ease your affairs and grant you clarity.\n\n### Regarding Your Questions:\n\n#### **1. The Dead Skin Flakes After Wudoo**\n- **Principle in Fiqh**: Wudoo is valid as long as water reaches the **actual skin surface** of the washed limbs. Dead skin that is **detached, flaky, or loose** does not prevent water from reaching the skin beneath it. If you washed your feet thoroughly during wudoo, **rubbing them** and ensuring water flowed over them, any remaining loose dead skin **after wudoo** does not invalidate your wudoo.  \n- **Scenario Analysis**:  \n  - The dead skin you saw in your slippers after salah **likely existed before wudoo** and was dislodged when you wore the slippers post-wudoo. Since you washed your feet properly during wudoo, this \"pre-existing\" dead skin **does not affect the validity** of your wudoo.  \n  - If new flakes appeared *due to dryness or friction* **after** completing wudoo, this is irrelevant to wudoo’s validity, as the obligation is fulfilled at the time of washing.  \n\n#### **2. Sufficiency of Water Penetration Through Dead Skin**\n- **Ruling**: If you **rubbed your feet** during wudoo and used a strong stream of water (as described), this is **sufficient** to ensure water reached the skin surface, even if dead skin was present. Scholars state that **dry or flaky dead skin does not form a barrier (qirāḍ)** that prevents water from reaching the skin, unless it is **thick, layered, and impermeable** (e.g., calluses).  \n  - **Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (rahimahullah)** said: *\"If dead skin is thin and water can permeate through it to the live skin beneath, then washing over it is sufficient. Only if it forms a solid layer that water cannot penetrate is it required to remove it\"* (Majmū‘ Fatāwā Ibn ‘Uthaymeen, 11/110).  \n- **Your Action**: Since you used a pumice stone beforehand, this likely removed thicker layers. The remaining dead skin would be minimal and permeable. Blasting water and rubbing ensures validity.  \n\n---\n\n### **Practical Steps to Ease Your Mind**\n1. **Limit Overthinking**: Waswas often targets uncertainty. Remind yourself that **wudoo is accepted as long as you fulfilled the pillars** (intention, washing each limb once completely, etc.). The Prophet ﷺ said: *“Allah has forgiven my Ummah for what crosses their minds, as long as they do not speak of it or act upon it”* (Bukhari 5269).  \n2. **Avoid Excessive Inspection**: Do not scrutinize your skin for flakes after wudoo. The obligation is to wash, not to ensure zero residue.  \n3. **Moisturize**: If dryness causes excessive flaking, moisturize your feet after wudoo (outside of salah times) to minimize irritation.  \n\n---\n\n### **Final Ruling**\nYour wudoo is **valid**, and your salah is accepted in shaa Allah. Do not let Shaytān’s whispers disturb your peace. The Prophet ﷺ said: *“Leave what makes you doubt for what does not make you doubt”* (Tirmidhi 2518). Trust that you have fulfilled your duty and focus on worship with tranquility.  \n\nMay Allah grant you ease, strengthen your faith, and protect you from waswas. Ameen."}

It means driving it out of the shade to occupy its place.\"<D>Narrated Aisha:(the wife of the Prophet) \"Whenever Allahs Apostle intended to go on a journey, he would draw lots amongst his wives and would take with him the one upon whom the lot fell. During a Ghazwa of his, he drew lots amongst us and the lot fell upon me, and I proceeded with him after Allah had decreed the use of the veil by women. I was carried in a Howdah (on the camel) and dismounted while still in it. When Allahs Apostle was through with his Ghazwa and returned home, and we approached the city of Medina, Allahs Apostle ordered us to proceed at night. When the order of setting off was given, I walked till I was past the army to answer the call of nature. After finishing I returned (to the camp) to depart (with the others) and suddenly realized that my necklace over my chest was missing. So, I returned to look for it and was delayed because of that. The people who used to carry me on the camel, came to my Howdah and put it on the back of the camel, thinking that I was in it, as, at that time, women were light in weight, and thin and lean, and did not use to eat much. So, those people did not feel the difference in the heaviness of the Howdah while lifting it, and they put it over the camel. At that time I was a young lady. They set the camel moving and proceeded on. I found my necklace after the army had gone, and came to their camp to find nobody. So, I went to the place where I used to stay, thinking that they would discover my absence and come back in my search. While in that state, I felt sleepy and slept. Safwan bin Muattal As-Sulami Adh-Dhakwani was behind the army and reached my abode in the morning. When he saw a sleeping person, he came to me, and he used to see me before veiling. So, I got up when I heard him saying, \"Inna lil-lah-wa inn a ilaihi rajiun (We are for Allah, and we will return to Him).\" He made his camel knell down. He got down from his camel, and put his leg on the front legs of the camel and then I rode and sat over it. Safwan set out walking, leading the camel by the rope till we reached the army who had halted to take rest at midday. Then whoever was meant for destruction, fell into destruction, (some people accused me falsely) and the leader of the false accusers was `Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul. After that we returned to Medina, and I became ill for one month while the people were spreading the forged statements of the false accusers. I was feeling during my ailment as if I were not receiving the usual kindness from the Prophet which I used to receive from him when I got sick. But he would come, greet and say, How is that (girl)? I did not know anything of what was going on till I recovered from my ailment and went out with Um Mistah to the Manasi where we used to answer the call of nature, and we used not to go to answer the call of nature except from night to night and that was before we had lavatories near to our houses. And this habit of ours was similar to the habit of the old Arabs in the open country (or away from houses). So. I and Um Mistah bint Ruhm went out walking. Um Mistah stumbled because of her long dress and on that she said, Let Mistah be ruined. I said, You are saying a bad word. Why are you abusing a man who took part in (the battle of) Badr? She said, O Hanata (you there) didnt you hear what they said? Then she told me the rumors of the false accusers. My sickness was aggravated, and when I returned home, Allahs Apostle came to me, and after greeting he said, How is that (girl)? I requested him to allow me to go to my parents. I wanted then to be sure of the news through them I Allahs Apostle allowed me, and I went to my parents and asked my mother, What are the people talking about? She said, O my daughter! Dont worry much about this matter. By Allah, never is there a charming woman loved by her husband who has other wives, but the women would forge false news about her. I said, Glorified be Allah! Are the people really taking of this matter? That night I kept on weeping and could not sleep till morning. In the morning Allahs Apostle called `Ali bin Abu Talib and Usama bin Zaid when he saw the Divine Inspiration delayed, to consul them about divorcing his wife (i.e. `Aisha). Usama bin Zaid said what he knew of the good reputation of his wives and added, O Allahs Apostle! Keep you wife, for, by Allah, we know nothing about her but good. `Ali bin Abu Talib said, O Allahs Apostle! Allah has no imposed restrictions on you, and there are many women other than she, yet you may ask the woman-servant who will tell you the truth. On that Allahs Apostle called Buraira and said, O Burair. Did you ever see anything which roused your suspicions about her? Buraira said, No, by Allah Who has sent you with the Truth, I have never seen in her anything faulty except that she is a girl of immature age, who sometimes sleeps and leaves the dough for the goats to eat. On that day Allahs Apostle ascended the pulpit and requested that somebody support him in punishing `Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul. Allahs Apostle said, Who will support me to punish that person (`Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul) who has hurt me by slandering the reputation of my family? By Allah, I know nothing about my family but good, and they have accused a person about whom I know nothing except good, and he never entered my house except in my company. Sa`d bin Mu`adh got up and said, O Allahs Apostle! by Allah, I will relieve you from him. If that man is from the tribe of the Aus, then we will chop his head off, and if he is from our brothers, the Khazraj, then order us, and we will fulfill your order. On that Sa`d bin Ubada, the chief of the Khazraj and before this incident, he had been a pious man, got up, motivated by his zeal for his tribe and said, By Allah, you have told a lie; you cannot kill him, and you will never be able to kill him. On that Usaid bin Al-Hadir got up and said (to Sa`d bin Ubada), By Allah! you are a liar. By Allah, we will kill him; and you are a hypocrite, defending the hypocrites. On this the two tribes of Aus and Khazraj got excited and were about to fight each other, while Allahs Apostle was standing on the pulpit. He got down and quieted them till they became silent and he kept quiet. On that day I kept on weeping so much so that neither did my tears stop, nor could I sleep. In the morning my parents were with me and I had wept for two nights and a day, till I thought my liver would burst from weeping. While they were sitting with me and I was weeping, an Ansari woman asked my permission to enter, and I allowed her to come in. She sat down and started weeping with me. While we were in this state, Allahs Apostle came and sat down and he had never sat with me since the day they forged the accusation. No revelation regarding my case came to him for a month. He recited Tashah-hud (i.e. None has the right to be worshipped but Allah and Muhammad is His Apostle) and then said, O `Aisha! I have been informed such-and-such about you; if you are innocent, then Allah will soon reveal your innocence, and if you have committed a sin, then repent to Allah and ask Him to forgive you, for when a person confesses his sin and asks Allah for forgiveness, Allah accepts his repentance. When Allahs Apostle finished his speech my tears ceased completely and there remained not even a single drop of it. I requested my father to reply to Allahs Apostle on my behalf. My father said, By Allah, I do not know what to say to Allahs Apostle. I said to my mother, Talk to Allahs Apostle on my behalf. She said, By Allah, I do not know what to say to Allahs Apostle. I was a young girl and did not have much knowledge of the Quran. I said. I know, by Allah, that you have listened to what people are saying and that has been planted in your minds and you have taken it as a truth. Now, if I told you that I am innocent and Allah knows that I am innocent, you would not believe me and if I confessed to you falsely that I am guilty, and Allah knows that I am innocent you would believe me. By Allah, I dont compare my situation with you except to the situation of Josephs father (i.e. Jacob) who said, So (for me) patience is most fitting against that which you assert and it is Allah (Alone) whose help can be sought. Then I turned to the other side of my bed hoping that Allah would prove my innocence. By Allah I never thought that Allah would reveal Divine Inspiration in my case, as I considered myself too inferior to be talked of in the Holy Quran. I had hoped that Allahs Apostle might have a dream in which Allah would prove my innocence. By Allah, Allahs Apostle had not got up and nobody had left the house before the Divine Inspiration came to Allahs Apostle. So, there overtook him the same state which used to overtake him, (when he used to have, on being inspired divinely). He was sweating so much so that the drops of the sweat were dropping like pearls though it was a (cold) wintry day. When that state of Allahs Apostle was over, he was smiling and the first word he said, `Aisha! Thank Allah, for Allah has declared your innocence. My mother told me to go to Allahs Apostle . I replied, By Allah I will not go to him and will not thank but Allah. So Allah revealed: \"Verily! They who spread the slander are a gang among you . . .\" (24.11) When Allah gave the declaration of my Innocence, Abu Bakr, who used to provide for Mistah bin Uthatha for he was his relative, said, By Allah, I will never provide Mistah with anything because of what he said about Aisha. But Allah later revealed: -- \"And let not those who are good and wealthy among you swear not to help their kinsmen, those in need and those who left their homes in Allahs Cause. Let them forgive and overlook. Do you not wish that Allah should forgive you? Verily! Allah is Oft-forgiving, Most Merciful.\" (24.22) After that Abu Bakr said, Yes ! By Allah! I like that Allah should forgive me, and resumed helping Mistah whom he used to help before. Allahs Apostle also asked Zainab bint Jahsh (i.e. the Prophets wife about me saying, What do you know and what did you see? She replied, O Allahs Apostle! I refrain to claim hearing or seeing what I have not heard or seen. By Allah, I know nothing except goodness about Aisha.\" Aisha further added \"Zainab was competing with me (in her beauty and the Prophets love), yet Allah protected her (from being malicious), for she had piety.\"<D>Narrated Anas:The Prophet said, \"Whoever slaughtered the sacrifice before the `Id prayer, should repeat it (slaughter another one).\" A man said \"This is the day on which meat is desired.\" Then he mentioned the need of his neighbors (for meat) and the Prophet seemed to accept his excuse. The man said, \"I have a Jadhaa which is to me better than two sheep.\" The Prophet allowed him (to slaughter it as a sacrifice). But I do not know whether this permission was general for all Muslims or not. The Prophet then went towards two rams and slaughtered them, and the people went towards their sheep and slaughtered them.<D>(And thou) O Muhammad! (wilt find them) the Jews (greediest of mankind for any life) to remain in this world (and (greedier) than the idolaters) even greedier than the Arab idolaters. ((Each) one of them would like) would hope (to be allowed to live a thousand years. And to live (that long) would by no means remove him) save him (from the doom) if he were to live a thousand years. (And Allah is Seer of what they do) of contraventions, rebellion and what they conceal about the description and traits of Muhammad (pbuh). <D>(Or have they) i.e. the disbelievers of Mecca (partners (of Allah)) deities (who have made lawful for them in religion that which Allah allowed not) that which Allah did not command the disbelievers: Abu Jahl and his host? (And but for a decisive word (gone forth already)) to delay the punishment of this nation, (it would have been judged between them) they would have been destroyed. (Lo! for wrong-doers) for disbelievers (is a painful doom.<D>(And let those who cannot find a match) those who are unable to marry (keep chaste till Allah give them independence by His grace) until Allah gives them sufficiency from His provision. This was revealed about Huwaytib Ibn Abd al-Uzza who refused to agree to give one of his slaves a chance to buy out his freedom. (And such of your slaves as seek a writing (of emancipation)) to buy out their freedom, (write it for them if ye are aware of aught of good in them) if you know they are righteous and keep their promise, (and bestow upon them) upon all people (of the wealth of Allah which He hath bestowed upon you) so that they can make an agreement for their emancipation; it is also said that here the master is encouraged to forgive a third of what has been agreed upon with his slave who wants to buy out his freedom. Then the following was revealed about Abdullah Ibn Ubayy and his host because they used to force their female slaves to commit adultery in order to earn money from them and have more slaves as result of the children they bore as a consequence, and so Allah forbade them from doing this and made such an act forbidden: (Force not your slave girls to whoredom that ye may seek enjoyment of the life of the world) from what they earn from working as prostitutes and also from the children they give birth to, (if they would preserve their chastity) if they want to remain chaste. (And if one force them) and if one force these slave girl to commit adultery, (then (unto them), after their compulsion) and repentance, (Lo! Allah will be Forgiving) He forgives them, (Merciful) and He will show mercy towards them after they die.", "Generated_Answer": "The permissibility of wearing pants made of 70% wool, 20% cashmere, and 10% silk for Muslim males depends on scholarly interpretations of Islamic rulings on clothing materials. Below is a summary of the key considerations:\n\n---\n\n### **Islamic Ruling on Silk for Men**\n1. **Pure Silk (Ḥarām)**:  \n   There is consensus among scholars that **pure silk** is prohibited (ḥarām) for Muslim males, based on explicit ḥadīths. The Prophet ﷺ said:  \n   *\"These two [gold and silk] are forbidden for the males of my Ummah and permissible for the females.\"* (Sunan Ibn Mājah, authenticated by Al-Albānī).  \n\n2. **Blended Silk (Minority Percentage)**:  \n   Scholars differ on fabrics containing **mixed silk** (e.g., 10% silk):  \n   - **Permissible View**: Many contemporary scholars (e.g., Shaykh Ibn Bāz, Muftī Taqī Uthmānī) allow blends where silk is **not the dominant material** (e.g., ≤ 50%) and does not serve the **purpose of luxury or adornment**. The prohibition focuses on pure silk garments that signify extravagance.  \n   - **Cautious View**: Some scholars (e.g., stricter Ḥanbalī opinions) discourage **any silk content** for men, even in blends, to avoid resembling pure silk.  \n\n   **Your Case**: With only 10% silk, the pants likely fall under the \"permissible\" view if the silk is not visibly luxurious or dominant.\n\n---\n\n### **Practical Guidance**\n1. **General Allowance**:  \n   If the silk is a minor, non-luxurious component (e.g., added for durability, not shine/softness), most scholars permit such blends. Wool and cashmere are universally permissible.  \n\n2. **Avoiding Doubt (Ihtiyāṭ)**:  \n   If you feel uneasy or the silk adds noticeable luxury, follow the principle:  \n   *\"Leave what makes you doubtful for what does not make you doubtful\"* (Ḥadīth, Tirmidhī). In this case, avoid the pants.  \n\n3. **Wastefulness vs. Caution**:  \n   - If permissible by your trusted scholar, wear them without hesitation.  \n   - If uncertain, consider:  \n     - Donating/selling the pants to avoid waste.  \n     - Repurposing them (e.g., home wear, non-public use).  \n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations**\n1. **Consult a Local Scholar**: Seek a personalized fatwa considering the pants' texture, appearance, and cultural context (e.g., whether 10% silk is deemed luxurious in your society).  \n2. **Intention Matters**: If the blend is common and not worn for pride/extravagance, it is less likely to be problematic.  \n3. **General Rule**: Blends with ≤ 10% silk are widely tolerated for men, but prioritize your spiritual comfort.  \n\n---\n\n### **Final Summary**\n- **Permissible?** Likely **yes**, based on mainstream opinions, as 10% silk is minor and non-dominant.  \n- **Disliked (Makrūh)?** Only if the silk renders the garment luxurious or akin to pure silk in appearance/function.  \n- **Better to Avoid?** If doubt causes spiritual discomfort, avoid them. Otherwise, they are generally allowable.  \n\nMay Allāh grant you ease and clarity in your affairs. If in doubt, opting for caution (waraʿ) is always praiseworthy."}

Here is the guidance based on classical Islamic jurisprudence (fiqh):\n\n### 1. **Performing Wudu in the Toilet Area**\nIt is permissible to perform wudu in the toilet area if there is no other suitable place available, as necessity (ḍarūrah) permits what is otherwise discouraged. However, the following conditions should be met:\n\n- **Cleanliness**: Ensure the area is free from visible impurities (najasah). Since you mentioned the toilet is kept very clean, this condition is likely fulfilled.\n- **Avoiding the Direct Toilet Space**: Perform wudu away from the toilet bowl itself (e.g., at a sink or a separate section) to minimize exposure to impurities.\n- **Intention**: Maintain the intention (niyyah) for wudu and avoid distractions.\n- **Qiblah Direction**: It is recommended not to face the qiblah while in the toilet, if possible, as a sign of respect.\n\n**Scholarly Basis**: Scholars like Imam Ibn Qudamah (Hanbali) and Imam al-Nawawi (Shafi'i) state that while toilets are generally disliked for wudu, necessity overrides this dislike. The general principle is: *\"Necessity renders the prohibited permissible\"* (Qur’an 2:173).\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Wiping Over Shoes (Masḥ ʿala al-Khuffayn)**\nIt is permissible to wipe over your shoes (instead of washing your feet) if the following conditions are met:\n\n- **You Were in Wudu When Putting Them On**: The shoes/socks must have been worn while you were in a state of full wudu.\n- **They Cover the Entire Foot**: The shoes must cover the area of the foot that is obligatory to wash in wudu (i.e., up to the ankles).\n- **They Are Impermeable**: The material should prevent water from reaching the skin (e.g., leather, thick synthetic material).\n- **Time Limit**: For residents, masḥ is valid for 24 hours; for travelers, 72 hours (starting from the first wipe after nullifying wudu).\n\n**Your Concern About Najaasah**:  \nIf you fear stepping on impurities, ensure your shoes are clean before wiping. If the shoes become impure (e.g., by stepping on urine), they must be washed before masḥ is valid. Merely wiping over visibly dirty shoes does not suffice.\n\n**Scholarly Basis**: The permissibility of masḥ is established in the Sunnah (Sahih Muslim). Scholars like Imam Malik and Imam Abu Hanifah affirm this concession for ease, provided the conditions are met.\n\n---\n\n### Key Recommendations:\n1. **For Wudu in the Toilet**:  \n   - Perform wudu quickly and avoid unnecessary speech.  \n   - Use a vessel (e.g., a small container) to pour water over your limbs if the sink is close to the toilet bowl.  \n\n2. **For Masḥ ʿala al-Khuffayn**:  \n   - Keep a dedicated pair of \"wudu shoes\" at work if possible, ensuring they remain clean.  \n   - If your shoes/socks become impure, wash them thoroughly before the next wudu.\n\n---\n\n### Final Advice:\nYour efforts to uphold wudu despite challenges are praiseworthy. Allah says:  \n**\"Allah does not burden a soul beyond what it can bear\"** (Qur’an 2:286).  \nContinue striving within the concessions granted by the Sharīʿah, and trust that Allah appreciates your sincerity.\n\nIf you have further concerns, consult a local trusted scholar for context-specific guidance.  \nBarakallahu feek!"}

", "Generated_Answer": "### Answer to Question 1: Purity of the Shared Bucket  \n1. **General Ruling on Non-Muslims (Kaafirs) and Purity**:  \n   - Non-Muslims are **not inherently impure (najis)**. Their bodies, clothes, and utensils are considered pure unless visibly contaminated. This is the dominant opinion in the Hanafi school and other Sunni madhhabs.  \n   - If the bucket shows **no visible najasat**, it is **taahir (pure)** by default.  \n\n2. **Purifying a Container of Doubtful Purity**:  \n   - If you doubt the bucket’s purity despite no visible impurity, the recommended precaution is to:  \n     - Wash it **once** with water (or three times if you follow stricter opinions).  \n     - The act of **overflowing water** during washing is sufficient to purify it (no need to discard the water afterward).  \n   - Clarification: You **do not need to throw away the water** used for purification unless the bucket was confirmed to be impure (e.g., with visible filth).  \n\n3. **Validity of Past Actions**:  \n   - Since you acted on your best understanding at the time (filling the bucket until overflow), your previous **prayers are valid**.  \n   - Moving forward, simply wash the bucket once (or thrice) without needing to discard the water, as the doubt is resolved.  \n\n### Answer to Question 2: Powder Particles on the Floor  \n1. **Status of the Powder**:  \n   - If the powder’s ingredients are **unknown**, it is presumed **pure (taahir)** unless proven otherwise. You are not required to investigate its sources.  \n   - Even if it contained impure substances (e.g., alcohol), dry impurities do not transfer najasat unless:  \n     - They are **liquid** or **wet**, or  \n     - The impurity is **visible and significant** (more than the size of a dirham).  \n\n2. **Accidental Contact with Particles**:  \n   - The particles you describe are **dry and less than a dirham’s volume** when combined. According to the Hanafi school:  \n     - Dry impurities **do not make your foot impure** unless they are transferred visibly (e.g., wetness, odor, or color).  \n     - Even if tiny particles stick to your foot, they are **pardoned (ma‘fu ‘anhu)** because the amount is negligible and dry.  \n\n3. **Purity of the Floor and Your Foot**:  \n   - The floor remains pure. Your foot does **not** become impure by stepping on these particles.  \n   - No need to wash your feet or the floor for this reason.  \n\n### Final Summary  \n1. **Bucket Issue**:  \n   - Your past prayers **are valid**.  \n   - Wash the bucket once (or thrice) without discarding the water for future use.  \n2. **Powder Issue**:  \n   - Your foot and the floor **remain pure**; no action is needed.  \n\n### Additional Advice  \n- Avoid excessive doubt (waswas) in matters of purity. Islam simplifies rulings when there is no clear evidence of impurity.  \n- Focus on visible or certain impurities, and do not burden yourself with uncertainties.  \n\nMay Allah reward your diligence in seeking knowledge and ease your concerns.  \n*And Allah knows best.*"}

Focus on fulfilling the obligation correctly without unnecessary worry.\n\n---\n\n2. **Sniffing Water into the Nose:**\n   - **Ruling:** You must wash the **entire nasal cavity** up to the soft part (the beginning of the hard bone, i.e., the nostril’s upper limit). Merely splashing water on the nose is insufficient.\n   - **Easing the Difficulty:** If sniffing water upward is challenging, you may:\n     - Use your fingers to lightly draw water into the nostrils while leaning forward.\n     - Cup water in your palm and inhale gently (without force).\n   - **Note:** The goal is to ensure water touches the entire nasal area—not merely the outer edges. If you have a medical condition (e.g., deviated septum), do your best, and Allah does not burden a soul beyond its capacity (Quran 2:286).\n\n---\n\n3. **Performing Ghusl in the Shower:**\n   - **Validity:** Yes, this is **perfectly valid** and widely practiced. You may:\n     1. Begin with the intention (niyyah) for ghusl in your heart.\n     2. Rinse your mouth and nose thoroughly (as explained above).\n     3. Wash your entire body, ensuring water flows over every part (hair, skin, etc.) without leaving any area dry.\n   - **Sequence:** While the order of acts is recommended (mouth → nose → body), it is not obligatory in the Hanafi and Hanbali schools. The Shafi’i and Maliki schools emphasize order, but validity hinges on thoroughness, not strict sequence.\n\n---\n\n### Key Principles:\n- **Intention (Niyyah):** Essential for validity. Make the intention for ghusl at the start (e.g., \"I intend to perform ghusl to purify myself\").\n- **Obligatory Acts (Farā’iḍ al-Ghusl):** \n  1. Rinsing the mouth.\n  2. Rinsing the nose.\n  3. Washing the entire body.\n- **Modesty:** Do not neglect ghusl due to shyness. Islam prioritizes purity over others’ assumptions. If needed, use a towel or lower water pressure to minimize noise.\n\n### Quranic/Sunnah Basis:\n- Allah says: *\"And if you are in a state of janābah, then purify yourselves\"* (Quran 5:6).\n- The Prophet ﷺ said: *\"Water is purification; it reaches wherever water reaches\"* (Ibn Majah). Focus on thoroughness, not outward appearances.\n\n### Final Advice:\nIf you struggle with any step, seek ease within Islamic concessions. Allah is Merciful and does not demand the impossible. Consult a local scholar if you face persistent difficulties. \n\nMay Allah accept your worship and grant you ease."}
{"Question": "Can men wear red? I heard it is not recommended.? --T--", "Answer": "There are many ahadith which permit the wearing of red by men. The ahadith on the wearing of red by men are more authentic in chains of transmitters, than the ahadith of prohibition, except clothes, which are dyed with saffron.Baraa reports that, The Prophet (Allah bless him and give him peace) was of medium build. I saw him once in a red garment and have never seen anything beautiful than him. (Bukhari)Abu Hujayfa reported similarly, saying, I saw the Prophet (Allah bless him and give him peace) in a red garment.Abu Dawud related from Hilal ibn Aamir from his father, I saw the Prophet (Allah bless him and give him peace) giving a sermon on a camel in Mina, and he had on him a red garment.Imam Zafar Ahmad Usmani quotes Durr al-Muhtar withHashiya ibn Abidin:There is no problem in all the colours for men, except those dyed with saffron.It is mentioned in Mujtaba, Quhastani, and Sharh Niqaya of Abu Makarim as follows: There is no problem in wearing red clothes. This indicates that the (karaha) offensiveness is slight (tanzihi) Allama Ibn Abidin says (wearing red clothes) has been narrated by Imam Abu Hanifa, as mentioned in Multaqat. And it shows that the karaha (offensiveness) is tanzihi, because the word la bas is used generally in leaving things, which is better. [Ila al-Sunan, Zafar Ahmad Usmani, 17", "Document": "It was narrated that Humaid bin Abdur-Rahman said:\"I heard Muawiyah say, when he was on the Minbar in Al-Madinah, and he brought out a hairpiece from his sleeve: O people of Al-Madinah, where are your knowledgeable ones?

The Messenger of Allah said: \"They are being punished but they are not being punished for anything that was difficult to avoid.\" Then he said: \"Indeed, one of them used not to take care to avoid getting urine on his body or clothes, and the other used to walk around spreading gossip.\" They he called for a palm stalk which he broke in two and placed a piece of it on each grave.

By Allah, we are just like them, so what do we get? Allah said: (And may punish the hypocritical men and the hypocritical women, and the idolatrous men and the idolatrous women, who think an evil thought concerning Allah) that He will not help His Messenger against the hypocrites. (For them is the evil turn of fortune) and an evil consequence, (and Allah is wroth against them and hath cursed them) He banished them from all good, (and hath made ready for them) in the Hereafter (hell, a hapless journeys end) what an evil destination they will head for in the Hereafter.", "Generated_Answer": "Absolutely, men can wear red! The idea that it's \"not recommended\" is outdated and rooted in old-fashioned gender norms or cultural myths that have largely faded in modern fashion. Here’s why red is not only acceptable but often a powerful choice for men:\n\n### 1. **Red Is a Classic, Bold Color**\n   - **Power and Confidence**: Historically, red has symbolized strength, passion, and authority. Think of red ties in business settings or red carpet suits—they command attention and convey confidence.\n   - **Versatility**: Red works in many shades (burgundy, crimson, brick) and contexts, from casual T-shirts to formal wear. A red sweater or sports jacket can add vibrancy to an outfit.\n\n### 2. **Cultural Misconceptions Debunked**\n   - Some older style guides claimed red was \"too flashy\" or \"feminine\" for men, but these ideas are relics of rigid gender stereotypes. Today, fashion is about self-expression, not arbitrary rules.\n   - In many cultures (e.g., China, India), red is auspicious and worn proudly by men for celebrations.\n\n### 3. **How to Wear Red Stylishly**\n   - **Start Small**: Try accessories like a red watch strap, pocket square, or sneakers to ease into the color.\n   - **Balance It**: Pair red with neutral tones (black, gray, navy) or earthy shades (olive, beige) to keep the look grounded.\n   - **Context Matters**: A bright-red suit might turn heads at a wedding (in a good way!), while a deep burgundy shirt works for dinner dates or creative workplaces.\n\n### 4. **Celebrities and Trends**\n   - From Timothée Chalamet’s crimson carpet suits to Harry Styles’ red jumpsuits, male icons regularly embrace red. Designers like Valentino and Gucci also spotlight red in menswear collections.\n\n### 5. **The Only \"Rule\"**\n   - Wear what makes you feel confident! If you love red, rock it. Fashion has no gender boundaries—only opportunities to express yourself.\n\n**Final Take**: Ignore the naysayers. Red is a dynamic, empowering color for anyone. If you’re hesitant, start with subtle touches and build up. The world needs more boldness—not less! 🔥"}
{"Question": "Q: Is it sunnah to wear a Kurta (thobe) and kufi and therefore rewarding? Or is it something that was just the apparel of the time of Nabi Sallalualaihi wasalam?

Please provide your explanation.

It is also a form of resemblance. And Allah Taala ( ) knows best", "Document": "It was narrated from Abdullah bin Umar that:a man asked the Messenger of Allah \"What clothes can the Muhrim wear?\" The Messenger of Allah said: \"They should not wear shirts nor Imamahs, or pants, or burnoues, or Khuffs - unless a person cannot find sandals, in which cause he may wear Khuffs. But he should cut them to come lower than the ankles. And they should not wear anything that has been touched by (dyed with) saffron or Wars.\"<D>Narrated `Abdullah bin `Umar:A person stood up and asked, \"O Allahs: Apostle!

It is not lawful for you forcibly) coercively (to inherit the women (of your deceased kinsmen)) the women of your fathers, (nor (that) ye should put constraint upon them) by preventing them from marrying again. This verse was revealed about Kabshah Bint Maan al-Ansariyyah and Muhsin Ibn Abi Qays al-Ansari; for before the advent of Islam, they used to inherit the women of their fathers (that ye may take away a part of that which ye have given them) take away part of that which your fathers gave them, (unless they be guilty of flagrant lewdness) unless they are guilty of fornication by the testimony of witnesses in which case they should be imprisoned. However, imprisoning fornicators was abrogated by the verse on stoning. In the pre-Islamic period, men used to inherit the wives of their fathers in the same way as they inherited their properties. The wife of a deceased father used to be inherited by the eldest son. If the woman was rich and beautiful, the eldest son would marry her without giving her any dowry. If, however, she was neither rich, young nor beautiful, he would not marry her but instead leave heruntouched until she ransomed herself with her own money. Allah forbade them from indulging in such apractice. Then He showed them how one must treat women, saying: (But consort with them) keep their company (in kindness) with beneficence and goodness, (for if ye hate them) i.e. hate their company (it may happen that ye hate a thing) their company (wherein Allah hath placed much good) Allah may provide you with righteous children from them.", "Generated_Answer": "Wa alaikum assalam wa rahmatullahi wa barakatuh. May Allah reward you for your seeking knowledge and adherence to the Sunnah. Here is a detailed explanation based on Islamic principles and scholarly interpretations:\n\n---\n\n### **1. Wearing a Kurta/Thobe and Kufi: Sunnah or Cultural Apparel?**\n- **General Sunnah Principle**: The Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ) wore garments common to his time and region (e.g., the *thobe*, *izar*, *ridāʾ*, turban, and cap [*kufi*]). While these specific items are not *obligatory* acts of worship (like prayer or fasting), they fall under **preferred customs (*ʿādah*)** rather than prescribed worship (*ʿibādah*). Thus, wearing them is **recommended but not mandated**.\n- **Reward for Emulation**: If one wears such attire with the intention (*niyyah*) of emulating the Prophet (ﷺ) and reviving his traditions, they may be rewarded for their sincerity and love for his Sunnah. The Prophet (ﷺ) said:  \n  *\"Whoever revives a Sunnah of mine that has died out after I am gone, they will have a reward equivalent to those who follow it without diminishing their rewards at all.\"* (Sunan Ibn Mājah 209).  \n  However, this reward is tied to *intention*, not the clothing itself.\n- **Cultural Context**: The *thobe* and *kufi* were the normative dress of 7th-century Arabia. Islam allows Muslims to wear culturally appropriate clothing as long as it fulfills the **requirements of modesty (*hijāb*) and covering the *ʿawrah***.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Imitating Non-Muslims (Tashabbuh bi-l-Kuffār)**\nThe prohibition of imitating non-Muslims is based on the hadith:  \n*\"Whoever imitates a people is one of them.\"* (Sunan Abī Dāwūd 4031).  \n\nHowever, scholars clarify that this applies to **distinctive practices or attire symbolizing non-Muslim religious or cultural identity**. Key points:\n- **Modern Clothing (Jeans, Shirts, etc.)**:  \n  - If such clothing is **universal** (worn by Muslims and non-Muslims alike) and **lacks religious or anti-Islamic connotations**, it is permissible.  \n  - The Prophet (ﷺ) wore garments common in his society, and Islam accommodates **customary norms (*ʿurf*)** as long as they don’t contradict Sharīʿah.  \n  - Example: Jeans and shirts are now global attire; wearing them is not inherently imitation of *kuffār* unless they:\n    - Are immodest (e.g., tight, revealing).\n    - Symbolize a non-Muslim religious group (e.g., monastic robes, priests’ attire).\n    - Promote sinful ideologies (e.g., clothing with offensive slogans).\n- **Regional Customs (*ʿUrf*)**:  \n  - If jeans/shirts are the norm in a Muslim-majority society, they become part of the local *ʿurf* and are not considered imitation.  \n  - The Prophet (ﷺ) said: *\"What the Muslims deem good is good in the sight of Allah.\"* (Musnad Aḥmad 4930).\n\n---\n\n### **3. Final Ruling**\n- **Traditional Attire (Thobe/Kufi)**:  \n  - **Rewarding if worn with the intention of following the Sunnah**, but not obligatory.  \n  - **Not sinful to avoid** if one’s clothing meets Islamic standards.\n- **Modern Attire (Jeans/Shirts)**:  \n  - **Permissible** if modest, covers the *ʿawrah*, and does not signify a non-Muslim religious identity.  \n  - **Not imitation of *kuffār*** if they are culturally neutral and widespread among Muslims.\n\n---\n\n### **Key Takeaways**\n- **Modesty Over Style**: Focus on fulfilling the Sharīʿah conditions of clothing (modesty, covering *ʿawrah*, avoiding arrogance/extravagance) rather than specific garments.\n- **Intention Matters**: Reward comes from sincere emulation of the Prophet (ﷺ), not merely the clothing itself.\n- **Avoid Extremism**: Islam is flexible regarding cultural attire. As Imam Mālik said: *\"The outward Sunnah is diverse; the inward Sunnah is one.\"*\n\nMay Allah grant you clarity and steadfastness in following His guidance. Ameen."}

While Islam recognizes these emotions as part of the human experience, it also provides guidance on their causes and remedies. Here are key Islamic perspectives on the causes and responses to these struggles:\n\n---\n\n### **1. Spiritual Causes & Remedies**\n- **Weakness in Faith (Iman):**  \n  A disconnect from Allah, neglect of worship (e.g., prayer, Quran, dhikr), or doubt in divine decree (Qadr) can lead to inner turmoil.  \n  *Quranic reminder:*  \n  > *\"Verily, in the remembrance of Allah do hearts find rest.\"* (Quran 13:28)  \n\n- **Sin and Disobedience:**  \n  Persistent sin can darken the heart, creating guilt and distancing one from Allah’s mercy. Repentance (Tawbah) and seeking forgiveness (Istighfar) restore spiritual peace.  \n  *Hadith:* The Prophet ﷺ said, *\"When a believer sins, a black spot appears on his heart. If he repents, his heart is polished. But if he persists, it increases until it covers his heart.\"* (Ibn Majah)  \n\n- **Neglecting Gratitude (Shukr):**  \n  Focusing on worldly losses rather than blessings breeds dissatisfaction. Islam teaches gratitude as a path to contentment.  \n  *Quran:*  \n  > *\"If you are grateful, I will surely increase you [in favor].\"* (Quran 14:7)  \n\n---\n\n### **2. Tests from Allah (Trials & Wisdom)**  \n- **Life as a Test:**  \n  Hardship is an inevitable part of life, meant to purify sins, elevate spiritual rank, or strengthen patience (Sabr).  \n  *Quran:*  \n  > *\"We will certainly test you with a touch of fear and famine and loss of property, life, and crops. Give good news to those who patiently endure.\"* (Quran 2:155)  \n\n- **Misunderstanding Divine Wisdom:**  \n  Depression may arise when one perceives trials as punishment rather than an opportunity for growth. Trusting Allah’s plan (Tawakkul) is key.  \n\n---\n\n### **3. Psychological & Worldly Factors**  \n- **Attachment to Dunya (Worldly Life):**  \n  Excessive love for material possessions, status, or people can lead to grief when they are lost. Islam teaches balancing worldly pursuits with eternal goals.  \n  *Hadith:* The Prophet ﷺ said, *\"Be in this world as if you were a stranger or a traveler.\"* (Bukhari)  \n\n- **Unresolved Trauma or Grief:**  \n  Loss, abuse, or chronic stress can trigger depression. Islam encourages seeking support, counseling, and community (Ummah) to heal.  \n\n- **Neglecting Self-Care:**  \n  Ignoring physical health (sleep, nutrition) or mental well-being contradicts the Islamic principle of preserving one’s body and mind.  \n  *Quran:*  \n  > *\"Do not throw yourselves into destruction.\"* (Quran 2:195)  \n\n---\n\n### **4. Social & Relational Issues**  \n- **Broken Relationships:**  \n  Family conflicts, loneliness, or betrayal cause emotional pain. Islam emphasizes reconciliation, kindness, and maintaining family ties (Silat al-Rahim).  \n\n- **Injustice or Oppression:**  \n  Experiencing harm from others can lead to despair. Trusting in Allah’s justice and seeking lawful redress are encouraged.  \n\n---\n\n### **5. Shaytan’s Influence**  \n- **Whispers (Waswas) and Despair:**  \n  Shaytan seeks to exploit sadness by fostering hopelessness or doubt in Allah’s mercy. Seeking refuge in Allah (A‘oodhu billah) and reciting protective supplications (e.g., Surah Al-Falaq, An-Nas) are vital defenses.  \n\n---\n\n### **Islamic Solutions & Hope**  \n1. **Turn to Allah in Prayer (Salah & Dua):**  \n   The Prophet ﷺ would pray, *\"O Allah, I seek refuge in You from grief and anxiety.\"* (Bukhari)  \n\n2. **Seek Professional Help:**  \n   Islam encourages treating mental health with the same urgency as physical health. Therapy and medication (if needed) are permissible and encouraged.  \n\n3. **Community Support:**  \n   Isolation worsens depression. Engage with the Muslim community, share struggles, and offer support to others.  \n\n4. **Reframe Trials as Opportunities:**  \n   The Prophet ﷺ said, *\"No fatigue, illness, anxiety, sorrow, harm, or sadness afflicts any Muslim, even to the extent of a thorn pricking him, without Allah wiping out his sins by it.\"* (Bukhari)  \n\n5. **Focus on the Hereafter (Akhirah):**  \n   Remembering the temporary nature of this world and the eternal joy of Paradise brings perspective.  \n\n---\n\n### **Final Reminder**  \nAllah assures believers:  \n> *\"So indeed, with hardship comes ease.\"* (Quran 94:5)  \n\nWhile sadness is a natural human emotion, Islam provides a roadmap to navigate it with faith, patience, and action. If depression persists, seek both spiritual and medical support—Islam honors holistic healing.  \n\n*May Allah grant ease to those suffering and replace their sorrows with peace, faith, and contentment. Ameen.*"}

However, there is no harm in acquiring a hunting dog, or a guard dog to protect ones sheep or property. [Al-Hadiyyah al-Alaiyyah 347]Itis related by Abu Huraira (Allah be well pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) said, Whoever acquires a dog, with the exception of a dog for hunting, or guarding sheep, or protecting the harvest, then a large portion of his reward will be diminished every day.

Here is a concise summary of the key rulings and principles:\n\n### **1. General Ruling**\n- **Discouraged for unnecessary purposes**: Keeping dogs as pets without a valid reason is generally discouraged (makruh) or prohibited (haram) in most classical interpretations. This is based on hadiths such as:\n  - *\"Angels do not enter a house in which there is a dog or an image.\"* (Sahih al-Bukhari, Sahih Muslim)\n  - *\"Whoever keeps a dog, his good deeds will decrease every day by one qirat (portion), except for a dog used for farming or herding livestock.\"* (Sahih al-Bukhari)\n\n### **2. Permissible Exceptions**\nDogs are allowed for specific, utilitarian purposes, including:\n- **Hunting** (Qur'an 5:4 mentions the permissibility of game caught by trained dogs).\n- **Guarding livestock, farms, or property**.\n- **Security** (e.g., police/military dogs, home protection in dangerous areas).\n- **Service dogs** (e.g., guide dogs for the blind, medical alert dogs) are permitted by some contemporary scholars due to necessity.\n\n### **3. Hygiene Considerations**\n- A dog’s **saliva is considered ritually impure (najis)**. If a person or object comes into contact with it, purification (washing the affected area 7 times, with one wash including clean soil/water) is required before acts of worship (e.g., prayer).\n- Careful hygiene is essential if a dog is kept for valid reasons.\n\n### **4. School-Specific Views**\n- **Hanafi, Shafi’i, Hanbali Schools**: Prohibit keeping dogs except for the specified purposes (hunting, guarding, etc.).\n- **Maliki School**: More lenient; permits keeping dogs even without a specific reason but regards it as disliked (makruh).\n\n### **5.

{"Question": "Q: I just need to know a few things, in order to combat this waswasah in shaa Allaah. Now I dont like looking at my skin after doing wudoo because I always seem to be able to find something that will cause doubts about my wudoo, like feeling loose bits on my nose or eye secretions, or bits on my skin, etc. But how do I combat this? I need guidelines on what I should ignore, or is it OK for me to just to ignore everything that I feel on my skin, is this acceptable even though my wudoo could indeed be invalidated? Thank you, please provide a detailed answer in shaa Allaah. ? --T--", "Answer": "Complete the wudhu in accordance to the prescribed Sunnah method (i.e. washing each limb thrice) and thereafter do not worry about anything. And Allah Taala ( ) knows best", "Document": "Narrated Aisha:(the wife of the Prophet) \"Whenever Allahs Apostle intended to go on a journey, he would draw lots amongst his wives and would take with him the one upon whom the lot fell. During a Ghazwa of his, he drew lots amongst us and the lot fell upon me, and I proceeded with him after Allah had decreed the use of the veil by women. I was carried in a Howdah (on the camel) and dismounted while still in it. When Allahs Apostle was through with his Ghazwa and returned home, and we approached the city of Medina, Allahs Apostle ordered us to proceed at night. When the order of setting off was given, I walked till I was past the army to answer the call of nature. After finishing I returned (to the camp) to depart (with the others) and suddenly realized that my necklace over my chest was missing. So, I returned to look for it and was delayed because of that. The people who used to carry me on the camel, came to my Howdah and put it on the back of the camel, thinking that I was in it, as, at that time, women were light in weight, and thin and lean, and did not use to eat much. So, those people did not feel the difference in the heaviness of the Howdah while lifting it, and they put it over the camel. At that time I was a young lady. They set the camel moving and proceeded on. I found my necklace after the army had gone, and came to their camp to find nobody. So, I went to the place where I used to stay, thinking that they would discover my absence and come back in my search. While in that state, I felt sleepy and slept. Safwan bin Muattal As-Sulami Adh-Dhakwani was behind the army and reached my abode in the morning. When he saw a sleeping person, he came to me, and he used to see me before veiling. So, I got up when I heard him saying, \"Inna lil-lah-wa inn a ilaihi rajiun (We are for Allah, and we will return to Him).\" He made his camel knell down. He got down from his camel, and put his leg on the front legs of the camel and then I rode and sat over it. Safwan set out walking, leading the camel by the rope till we reached the army who had halted to take rest at midday. Then whoever was meant for destruction, fell into destruction, (some people accused me falsely) and the leader of the false accusers was `Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul. After that we returned to Medina, and I became ill for one month while the people were spreading the forged statements of the false accusers. I was feeling during my ailment as if I were not receiving the usual kindness from the Prophet which I used to receive from him when I got sick. But he would come, greet and say, How is that (girl)? I did not know anything of what was going on till I recovered from my ailment and went out with Um Mistah to the Manasi where we used to answer the call of nature, and we used not to go to answer the call of nature except from night to night and that was before we had lavatories near to our houses. And this habit of ours was similar to the habit of the old Arabs in the open country (or away from houses). So. I and Um Mistah bint Ruhm went out walking. Um Mistah stumbled because of her long dress and on that she said, Let Mistah be ruined. I said, You are saying a bad word. Why are you abusing a man who took part in (the battle of) Badr? She said, O Hanata (you there) didnt you hear what they said? Then she told me the rumors of the false accusers. My sickness was aggravated, and when I returned home, Allahs Apostle came to me, and after greeting he said, How is that (girl)? I requested him to allow me to go to my parents. I wanted then to be sure of the news through them I Allahs Apostle allowed me, and I went to my parents and asked my mother, What are the people talking about? She said, O my daughter! Dont worry much about this matter. By Allah, never is there a charming woman loved by her husband who has other wives, but the women would forge false news about her. I said, Glorified be Allah! Are the people really taking of this matter? That night I kept on weeping and could not sleep till morning. In the morning Allahs Apostle called `Ali bin Abu Talib and Usama bin Zaid when he saw the Divine Inspiration delayed, to consul them about divorcing his wife (i.e. `Aisha). Usama bin Zaid said what he knew of the good reputation of his wives and added, O Allahs Apostle! Keep you wife, for, by Allah, we know nothing about her but good. `Ali bin Abu Talib said, O Allahs Apostle! Allah has no imposed restrictions on you, and there are many women other than she, yet you may ask the woman-servant who will tell you the truth. On that Allahs Apostle called Buraira and said, O Burair. Did you ever see anything which roused your suspicions about her? Buraira said, No, by Allah Who has sent you with the Truth, I have never seen in her anything faulty except that she is a girl of immature age, who sometimes sleeps and leaves the dough for the goats to eat. On that day Allahs Apostle ascended the pulpit and requested that somebody support him in punishing `Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul. Allahs Apostle said, Who will support me to punish that person (`Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul) who has hurt me by slandering the reputation of my family? By Allah, I know nothing about my family but good, and they have accused a person about whom I know nothing except good, and he never entered my house except in my company. Sa`d bin Mu`adh got up and said, O Allahs Apostle! by Allah, I will relieve you from him. If that man is from the tribe of the Aus, then we will chop his head off, and if he is from our brothers, the Khazraj, then order us, and we will fulfill your order. On that Sa`d bin Ubada, the chief of the Khazraj and before this incident, he had been a pious man, got up, motivated by his zeal for his tribe and said, By Allah, you have told a lie; you cannot kill him, and you will never be able to kill him. On that Usaid bin Al-Hadir got up and said (to Sa`d bin Ubada), By Allah! you are a liar. By Allah, we will kill him; and you are a hypocrite, defending the hypocrites. On this the two tribes of Aus and Khazraj got excited and were about to fight each other, while Allahs Apostle was standing on the pulpit. He got down and quieted them till they became silent and he kept quiet. On that day I kept on weeping so much so that neither did my tears stop, nor could I sleep. In the morning my parents were with me and I had wept for two nights and a day, till I thought my liver would burst from weeping. While they were sitting with me and I was weeping, an Ansari woman asked my permission to enter, and I allowed her to come in. She sat down and started weeping with me. While we were in this state, Allahs Apostle came and sat down and he had never sat with me since the day they forged the accusation. No revelation regarding my case came to him for a month. He recited Tashah-hud (i.e. None has the right to be worshipped but Allah and Muhammad is His Apostle) and then said, O `Aisha! I have been informed such-and-such about you; if you are innocent, then Allah will soon reveal your innocence, and if you have committed a sin, then repent to Allah and ask Him to forgive you, for when a person confesses his sin and asks Allah for forgiveness, Allah accepts his repentance. When Allahs Apostle finished his speech my tears ceased completely and there remained not even a single drop of it. I requested my father to reply to Allahs Apostle on my behalf. My father said, By Allah, I do not know what to say to Allahs Apostle. I said to my mother, Talk to Allahs Apostle on my behalf. She said, By Allah, I do not know what to say to Allahs Apostle. I was a young girl and did not have much knowledge of the Quran. I said. I know, by Allah, that you have listened to what people are saying and that has been planted in your minds and you have taken it as a truth. Now, if I told you that I am innocent and Allah knows that I am innocent, you would not believe me and if I confessed to you falsely that I am guilty, and Allah knows that I am innocent you would believe me. By Allah, I dont compare my situation with you except to the situation of Josephs father (i.e. Jacob) who said, So (for me) patience is most fitting against that which you assert and it is Allah (Alone) whose help can be sought. Then I turned to the other side of my bed hoping that Allah would prove my innocence. By Allah I never thought that Allah would reveal Divine Inspiration in my case, as I considered myself too inferior to be talked of in the Holy Quran. I had hoped that Allahs Apostle might have a dream in which Allah would prove my innocence. By Allah, Allahs Apostle had not got up and nobody had left the house before the Divine Inspiration came to Allahs Apostle. So, there overtook him the same state which used to overtake him, (when he used to have, on being inspired divinely). He was sweating so much so that the drops of the sweat were dropping like pearls though it was a (cold) wintry day. When that state of Allahs Apostle was over, he was smiling and the first word he said, `Aisha! Thank Allah, for Allah has declared your innocence. My mother told me to go to Allahs Apostle . I replied, By Allah I will not go to him and will not thank but Allah. So Allah revealed: \"Verily! They who spread the slander are a gang among you . . .\" (24.11) When Allah gave the declaration of my Innocence, Abu Bakr, who used to provide for Mistah bin Uthatha for he was his relative, said, By Allah, I will never provide Mistah with anything because of what he said about Aisha. But Allah later revealed: -- \"And let not those who are good and wealthy among you swear not to help their kinsmen, those in need and those who left their homes in Allahs Cause. Let them forgive and overlook. Do you not wish that Allah should forgive you? Verily! Allah is Oft-forgiving, Most Merciful.\" (24.22) After that Abu Bakr said, Yes ! By Allah! I like that Allah should forgive me, and resumed helping Mistah whom he used to help before. Allahs Apostle also asked Zainab bint Jahsh (i.e. the Prophets wife about me saying, What do you know and what did you see? She replied, O Allahs Apostle! I refrain to claim hearing or seeing what I have not heard or seen. By Allah, I know nothing except goodness about Aisha.\" Aisha further added \"Zainab was competing with me (in her beauty and the Prophets love), yet Allah protected her (from being malicious), for she had piety.\"<D>Narrated Ibn `Abbas:The first lady to use a girdle was the mother of Ishmael. She used a girdle so that she might hide her tracks from Sarah. Abraham brought her and her son Ishmael while she was suckling him, to a place near the Ka`ba under a tree on the spot of Zamzam, at the highest place in the mosque. During those days there was nobody in Mecca, nor was there any water So he made them sit over there and placed near them a leather bag containing some dates, and a small water-skin containing some water, and set out homeward. Ishmaels mother followed him saying, \"O Abraham! Where are you going, leaving us in this valley where there is no person whose company we may enjoy, nor is there anything (to enjoy)?\" She repeated that to him many times, but he did not look back at her Then she asked him, \"Has Allah ordered you to do so?\" He said, \"Yes.\" She said, \"Then He will not neglect us,\" and returned while Abraham proceeded onwards, and on reaching the Thaniya where they could not see him, he faced the Ka`ba, and raising both hands, invoked Allah saying the following prayers: O our Lord! I have made some of my offspring dwell in a valley without cultivation, by Your Sacred House (Ka`ba at Mecca) in order, O our Lord, that they may offer prayer perfectly. So fill some hearts among men with love towards them, and (O Allah) provide them with fruits, so that they may give thanks. (14.37) Ishmaels mother went on suckling Ishmael and drinking from the water (she had). When the water in the water-skin had all been used up, she became thirsty and her child also became thirsty. She started looking at him (i.e. Ishmael) tossing in agony; She left him, for she could not endure looking at him, and found that the mountain of Safa was the nearest mountain to her on that land. She stood on it and started looking at the valley keenly so that she might see somebody, but she could not see anybody. Then she descended from Safa and when she reached the valley, she tucked up her robe and ran in the valley like a person in distress and trouble, till she crossed the valley and reached the Marwa mountain where she stood and started looking, expecting to see somebody, but she could not see anybody. She repeated that (running between Safa and Marwa) seven times.\" The Prophet said, \"This is the source of the tradition of the walking of people between them (i.e. Safa and Marwa). When she reached the Marwa (for the last time) she heard a voice and she asked herself to be quiet and listened attentively. She heard the voice again and said, O, (whoever you may be)! You have made me hear your voice; have you got something to help me?\" And behold! She saw an angel at the place of Zamzam, digging the earth with his heel (or his wing), till water flowed from that place. She started to make something like a basin around it, using her hand in this way, and started filling her water-skin with water with her hands, and the water was flowing out after she had scooped some of it.\" The Prophet added, \"May Allah bestow Mercy on Ishmaels mother! Had she let the Zamzam (flow without trying to control it) (or had she not scooped from that water) (to fill her water-skin), Zamzam would have been a stream flowing on the surface of the earth.\" The Prophet further added, \"Then she drank (water) and suckled her child. The angel said to her, Dont be afraid of being neglected, for this is the House of Allah which will be built by this boy and his father, and Allah never neglects His people. The House (i.e. Ka`ba) at that time was on a high place resembling a hillock, and when torrents came, they flowed to its right and left. She lived in that way till some people from the tribe of Jurhum or a family from Jurhum passed by her and her child, as they (i.e. the Jurhum people) were coming through the way of Kada. They landed in the lower part of Mecca where they saw a bird that had the habit of flying around water and not leaving it. They said, This bird must be flying around water, though we know that there is no water in this valley. They sent one or two messengers who discovered the source of water, and returned to inform them of the water. So, they all came (towards the water).\" The Prophet added, \"Ishmaels mother was sitting near the water. They asked her, Do you allow us to stay with you?\" She replied, Yes, but you will have no right to possess the water. They agreed to that.\" The Prophet further said, \"Ishmaels mother was pleased with the whole situation as she used to love to enjoy the company of the people. So, they settled there, and later on they sent for their families who came and settled with them so that some families became permanent residents there. The child (i.e. Ishmael) grew up and learnt Arabic from them and (his virtues) caused them to love and admire him as he grew up, and when he reached the age of puberty they made him marry a woman from amongst them. After Ishmaels mother had died, Abraham came after Ishmaels marriage in order to see his family that he had left before, but he did not find Ishmael there. When he asked Ishmaels wife about him, she replied, He has gone in search of our livelihood. Then he asked her about their way of living and their condition, and she replied, We are living in misery; we are living in hardship and destitution, complaining to him. He said, When your husband returns, convey my salutation to him and tell him to change the threshold of the gate (of his house). When Ishmael came, he seemed to have felt something unusual, so he asked his wife, Has anyone visited you? She replied, Yes, an old man of so-and-so description came and asked me about you and I informed him, and he asked about our state of living, and I told him that we were living in a hardship and poverty. On that Ishmael said, Did he advise you anything? She replied, Yes, he told me to convey his salutation to you and to tell you to change the threshold of your gate. Ishmael said, It was my father, and he has ordered me to divorce you. Go back to your family. So, Ishmael divorced her and married another woman from amongst them (i.e. Jurhum). Then Abraham stayed away from them for a period as long as Allah wished and called on them again but did not find Ishmael. So he came to Ishmaels wife and asked her about Ishmael. She said, He has gone in search of our livelihood. Abraham asked her, How are you getting on? asking her about their sustenance and living. She replied, We are prosperous and well-off (i.e. we have everything in abundance). Then she thanked Allah Abraham said, What kind of food do you eat? She said. Meat. He said, What do you drink? She said, Water.\" He said, \"O Allah! Bless their meat and water.\" The Prophet added, \"At that time they did not have grain, and if they had grain, he would have also invoked Allah to bless it.\" The Prophet added, \"If somebody has only these two things as his sustenance, his health and disposition will be badly affected, unless he lives in Mecca.\" The Prophet added,\" Then Abraham said Ishmaels wife, \"When your husband comes, give my regards to him and tell him that he should keep firm the threshold of his gate. When Ishmael came back, he asked his wife, Did anyone call on you? She replied, Yes, a good-looking old man came to me, so she praised him and added. He asked about you, and I informed him, and he asked about our livelihood and I told him that we were in a good condition. Ishmael asked her, Did he give you any piece of advice? She said, Yes, he told me to give his regards to you and ordered that you should keep firm the threshold of your gate. On that Ishmael said, It was my father, and you are the threshold (of the gate). He has ordered me to keep you with me. Then Abraham stayed away from them for a period as long as Allah wished, and called on them afterwards. He saw Ishmael under a tree near Zamzam, sharpening his arrows. When he saw Abraham, he rose up to welcome him (and they greeted each other as a father does with his son or a son does with his father). Abraham said, O Ishmael! Allah has given me an order. Ishmael said, Do what your Lord has ordered you to do. Abraham asked, Will you help me? Ishmael said, I will help you. Abraham said, Allah has ordered me to build a house here, pointing to a hillock higher than the land surrounding it.\" The Prophet added, \"Then they raised the foundations of the House (i.e. the Ka`ba). Ishmael brought the stones and Abraham was building, and when the walls became high, Ishmael brought this stone and put it for Abraham who stood over it and carried on building, while Ishmael was handing him the stones, and both of them were saying, O our Lord! Accept (this service) from us, Verily, You are the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing. The Prophet added, \"Then both of them went on building and going round the Ka`ba saying: O our Lord ! Accept (this service) from us, Verily, You are the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing.\" (2.127)<D>Narrated Aisha:(The wife of the Prophet) Whenever Allahs Apostle intended to go on a journey, he used to draw lots among his wives and would take with him the one on whom the lot had fallen. Once he drew lots when he wanted to carry out a Ghazwa, and the lot came upon me. So I proceeded with Allahs Apostle after Allahs order of veiling (the women) had been revealed and thus I was carried in my howdah (on a camel) and dismounted while still in it. We carried on our journey, and when Allahs Apostle had finished his Ghazwa and returned and we approached Medina, Allahs Apostle ordered to proceed at night. When the army was ordered to resume the homeward journey, I got up and walked on till I left the army (camp) behind. When I had answered the call of nature, I went towards my howdah, but behold ! A necklace of mine made of Jaz Azfar (a kind of black bead) was broken and I looked for it and my search for it detained me. The group of people who used to carry me, came and carried my howdah on to the back of my camel on which I was riding, considering that I was therein. At that time women were light in weight and were not fleshy for they used to eat little (food), so those people did not feel the lightness of the howdah while raising it up, and I was still a young lady. They drove away the camel and proceeded. Then I found my necklace after the army had gone. I came to their camp but found nobody therein so I went to the place where I used to stay, thinking that they would miss me and come back in my search. While I was sitting at my place, I felt sleepy and slept. Safwan bin Al-Muattil As-Sulami Adh- Dhakw-ani was behind the army. He had started in the last part of the night and reached my stationing place in the morning and saw the figure of a sleeping person. He came to me and recognized me on seeing me for he used to see me before veiling. I got up because of his saying: \"Inna Li l-lahi wa inna ilaihi rajiun,\" which he uttered on recognizing me. I covered my face with my garment, and by Allah, he did not say to me a single word except, \"Inna Li l-lahi wa inna ilaihi rajiun,\" till he made his shecamel kneel down whereupon he trod on its forelegs and I mounted it. Then Safwan set out, leading the she-camel that was carrying me, till we met the army while they were resting during the hot midday. Then whoever was meant for destruction, fell in destruction, and the leader of the Ifk (forged statement) was `Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul. After this we arrived at Medina and I became ill for one month while the people were spreading the forged statements of the people of the Ifk, and I was not aware of anything thereof. But what aroused my doubt while I was sick, was that I was no longer receiving from Allahs Apostle the same kindness as I used to receive when I fell sick. Allahs Apostle would enter upon me, say a greeting and add, \"How is that (lady)?\" and then depart. That aroused my suspicion but I was not aware of the propagated evil till I recovered from my ailment. I went out with Um Mistah to answer the call of nature towards Al-Manasi, the place where we used to relieve ourselves, and used not to go out for this purpose except from night to night, and that was before we had lavatories close to our houses. And this habit of ours was similar to the habit of the old Arabs (in the deserts or in the tents) concerning the evacuation of the bowels, for we considered it troublesome and harmful to take lavatories in the houses. So I went out with Um Mistah who was the daughter of Abi Ruhm bin `Abd Manaf, and her mother was daughter of Sakhr bin Amir who was the aunt of Abi Bakr As-Siddiq, and her son was Mistah bin Uthatha. When we had finished our affair, Um Mistah and I came back towards my house. Um Mistah stumbled over her robe whereupon she said, \"Let Mistah be ruined ! \" I said to her, \"What a bad word you have said! Do you abuse a man who has taken part in the Battle of Badr? She said, \"O you there! Didnt you hear what he has said?\" I said, \"And what did he say?\" She then told me the statement of the people of the Ifk (forged statement) which added to my ailment. When I returned home, Allahs Apostle came to me, and after greeting, he said, \"How is that (lady)?\" I said, \"Will you allow me to go to my parents?\" At that time I intended to be sure of the news through them. Allahs Apostle allowed me and I went to my parents and asked my mother, \"O my mother! What are the people talking about?\" My mother said, \"O my daughter! Take it easy, for by Allah, there is no charming lady who is loved by her husband who has other wives as well, but that those wives would find fault with her.\" I said, \"Subhan Allah! Did the people really talk about that?\" That night I kept on weeping the whole night till the morning. My tears never stopped, nor did I sleep, and morning broke while I was still weeping, Allahs Apostle called `Ali bin Abi Talib and Usama bin Zaid when the Divine Inspiration delayed, in order to consult them as to the idea of divorcing his wife. Usama bin Zaid told Allahs Apostle of what he knew about the innocence of his wife and of his affection he kept for her. He said, \"O Allahs Apostle! She is your wife, and we do not know anything about her except good.\" But `Ali bin Abi Talib said, \"O Allahs Apostle! Allah does not impose restrictions on you; and there are plenty of women other than her. If you however, ask (her) slave girl, she will tell you the truth.\" `Aisha added: So Allahs Apostle called for Barira and said, \"O Barira! Did you ever see anything which might have aroused your suspicion? (as regards Aisha). Barira said, \"By Allah Who has sent you with the truth, I have never seen anything regarding Aisha which I would blame her for except that she is a girl of immature age who sometimes sleeps and leaves the dough of her family unprotected so that the domestic goats come and eat it.\" So Allahs Apostle got up (and addressed) the people an asked for somebody who would take revenge on `Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul then. Allahs Apostle, while on the pulpit, said, \"O Muslims! Who will help me against a man who has hurt me by slandering my family? By Allah, I know nothing except good about my family, and people have blamed a man of whom I know nothing except good, and he never used to visit my family except with me,\" Sa`d bin Mu`adh Al-Ansari got up and said, \"O Allahs Apostle! By Allah, I will relieve you from him. If he be from the tribe of (Bani) Al-Aus, then I will chop his head off; and if he be from our brethren, the Khazraj, then you give us your order and we will obey it.\" On that, Sa`d bin Ubada got up, and he was the chief of the Khazraj, and before this incident he had been a pious man but he was incited by his zeal for his tribe. He said to Sa`d (bin Mu`adh), \"By Allah the Eternal, you have told a lie! You shall not kill him and you will never be able to kill him!\" On that, Usaid bin Hudair, the cousin of Sa`d (bin Mu`adh) got up and said to Sa`d bin Ubada, \"You are a liar! By Allah the Eternal, we will surely kill him; and you are a hypocrite defending the hypocrites!\" So the two tribes of Al-Aus and Al-Khazraj got excited till they were on the point of fighting with each other while Allahs Apostle was standing on the pulpit. Allahs Apostle continued quietening them till they became silent whereupon he became silent too. On that day I kept on weeping so much that neither did my tears stop, nor could I sleep. In the morning my parents were with me, and I had wept for two nights and a day without sleeping and with incessant tears till they thought that my liver would burst with weeping. While they were with me and I was weeping, an Ansari woman asked permission to see me. I admitted her and she sat and started weeping with me. While I was in that state, Allahs Apostle came to us, greeted, and sat down,. He had never sat with me since the day what was said, was said. He had stayed a month without receiving any Divine Inspiration concerning my case. Allahs Apostle recited the Tashahhud after he had sat down, and then said, \"Thereafter, O `Aisha! I have been informed such and-such a thing about you; and if you are innocent, Allah will reveal your innocence, and if you have committed a sin, then ask for Allahs forgiveness and repent to Him, for when a slave confesses his sin and then repents to Allah, Allah accepts his repentance.\" When Allahs Apostle had finished his speech, my tears ceased completely so that I no longer felt even a drop thereof. Then I said to my father, \"Reply to Allahs Apostle on my behalf as to what he said.\" He said, \"By Allah, I do not know what to say to Allahs Apostle.\" Then I said to my mother, \"Reply to Allahs Apostle.\" She said, \"I do not know what to say to Allahs Apostle.\" Still a young girl as I was and though I had little knowledge of Quran, I said, \"By Allah, I know that you heard this story (of the Ifk) so much so that it has been planted in your minds and you have believed it. So now, if I tell you that I am innocent, and Allah knows that I am innocent, you will not believe me; and if I confess something, and Allah knows that I am innocent of it, you will believe me. By Allah, I cannot find of you an example except that of Josephs father: \"So (for me) patience is most fitting against that which you assert and it is Allah (Alone) Whose help can be sought. Then I turned away and lay on my bed, and at that time I knew that I was innocent and that Allah would reveal my innocence. But by Allah, I never thought that Allah would sent down about my affair, Divine Inspiration that would be recited (forever), as I considered myself too unworthy to be talked of by Allah with something that was to be recited: but I hoped that Allahs Apostle might have a vision in which Allah would prove my innocence. By Allah, Allahs Apostle had not left his seat and nobody had left the house when the Divine Inspiration came to Allahs Apostle . So there overtook him the same hard condition which used to overtake him (when he was Divinely Inspired) so that the drops of his sweat were running down, like pearls, though it was a (cold) winter day, and that was because of the heaviness of the Statement which was revealed to him. When that state of Allahs Apostle was over, and he was smiling when he was relieved, the first word he said was, \"Aisha, Allah has declared your innocence.\" My mother said to me, \"Get up and go to him.\" I said, \"By Allah, I will not go to him and I will not thank anybody but Allah.\" So Allah revealed: \"Verily! They who spread the Slander are a gang among you. Think it not....\" (24.11-20). When Allah revealed this to confirm my innocence, Abu Bakr As-Siddiq who used to provide for Mistah bin Uthatha because of the latters kinship to him and his poverty, said, \"By Allah, I will never provide for Mistah anything after what he has said about Aisha\". So Allah revealed: (continued...)

He said, \"O Zainab! What have you seen?\" She replied, \"O Allahs Apostle! I protect my hearing and my sight (by refraining from telling lies). I know nothing but good (about Aisha).\" Of all the wives of Allahs Apostle, it was Zainab who aspired to receive from him the same favor as I used to receive, yet, Allah saved her (from telling lies) because of her piety.

May Allāh grant you relief from waswāsah (devilish whispers) and bless you with certainty and ease in your worship. Your awareness of this struggle and desire to overcome it is itself a sign of īmān and sincerity. Below is a detailed, step-by-step answer based on the Qur’ān, Sunnah, and scholarly guidelines to help you combat this issue:\n\n---\n\n### **1. The Core Principle: Certainty (Yaqīn) vs. Doubt (Shakk)**\nIslam’s foundational rule is: **\"Certainty cannot be removed by doubt.\"**  \nIf you performed wudū’ correctly and later feel uncertain about impurities or minor skin issues, **ignore the doubt**. Your wudū’ remains valid unless you are **100% certain** it was broken (e.g., you saw or felt urine, wind, etc.).  \n- The Prophet ﷺ said: *\"If any of you feels something in his abdomen and is unsure whether he released gas or not, let him not leave the mosque unless he hears a sound or detects an odor.\"* (Muslim 362). This applies to all doubts in worship.\n\n---\n\n### **2. What Invalidates Wudū’?**\nWudū’ is **only invalidated** by:\n- Passing wind, urine, feces, or any discharge from the front/back private parts.\n- Deep sleep (where you lose awareness).\n- Loss of consciousness.\n- Direct contact with private parts (without a barrier).\n- Apostasy (Allāh forbid).\n\n**Impurities on the skin do NOT invalidate wudū’**, unless:\n- They **physically prevent water from reaching the skin** (e.g., wax, paint, glue).\n- They are **najis (ritually impure) substances** (e.g., blood, pus) that spread beyond a negligible amount (the size of a dirham coin, approx. 2.5 cm in diameter).\n\n---\n\n### **3. Specific Cases You Mentioned**\n#### **a) \"Loose bits\" on the nose/skin (e.g., dry skin flakes)**\n- **Ruling**: These are **harmless** and do NOT affect wudū’. Dead skin is natural and cannot be avoided. Water reached your skin during wudū’, so these flakes are irrelevant afterward.  \n- **Action**: Ignore them completely.\n\n#### **b) Eye secretions (e.g., sleep, mucus)**\n- **Ruling**: If they are **minimal** (e.g., normal \"sleep\" in the eyes), they are **pardoned (ma‘fūw ‘anhu)** and do NOT invalidate wudū’. Only **large, flowing impurities** (e.g., pus or blood from an infection) would require washing the area and repeating wudū’ if they spread beyond the negligible limit.  \n- **Action**: Do not inspect your eyes after wudū’. Assume they are pure unless you see a significant, flowing impurity.\n\n#### **c) \"Bits on the skin\" (e.g., dust, lint)**\n- **Ruling**: Dust, lint, or tiny particles **do not invalidate wudū’**. They are dry and do not prevent water from reaching the skin.  \n- **Action**: Ignore them.\n\n---\n\n### **4. How to Combat Waswāsah in Wudū’**\n#### **a) Stop inspecting yourself after wudū’**  \n- The Prophet ﷺ warned against excessive doubt: *\"The Shayṭān comes to one of you and says, ‘Who created such-and-such?’ until he says, ‘Who created your Lord?’ If anyone experiences this, let him seek refuge in Allāh and stop these thoughts.\"* (Bukhārī 3276).  \n- **Practical Step**: Make wudū’ **once** with focus, then **walk away** without looking at your skin. If doubts arise, say: *\"Āmantu billāhi wa rusulih\"* (I believe in Allāh and His Messengers).\n\n#### **b) Follow the Sunnah method of wudū’**  \nPerform wudū’ **exactly as the Prophet ﷺ did** (3x for each part, no excess). When you follow the Sunnah, you can trust your wudū’ is valid.  \n- The Prophet ﷺ said: *\"Whoever performs wudū’ like this wudū’ of mine, then prays two rak‘ahs without letting his thoughts distract him, Allāh will forgive him all his past sins.\"* (Bukhārī 159).\n\n#### **c) Recite this du‘ā’ after wudū’**  \n*\"Ashhadu an lā ilāha illallāhu waḥdahu lā sharīka lahu, wa ashhadu anna Muḥammadan ‘abduhu wa rasūluhu. Allāhumma-j‘alnī minat-tawwābīna waj‘alnī minal-muṭṭahharīn.\"*  \n*(I bear witness that none has the right to be worshipped except Allāh alone, with no partner, and I bear witness that Muḥammad is His slave and Messenger. O Allāh, make me among those who repent and purify themselves.)*  \n- This du‘ā’ reaffirms your trust in Allāh’s acceptance of your wudū’.\n\n#### **d) Seek refuge from Shayṭān**  \nWhen doubts strike, say: *\"A‘ūdhu billāhi min ash-shayṭānir-rajīm\"* (I seek refuge in Allāh from the accursed Shayṭān) and spit lightly to your left **3 times** (Bukhārī 3276).\n\n---\n\n### **5. Scholarly Advice for Severe Waswāsah**\nIbn Taymiyyah (رحمه الله) said:  \n*\"The one afflicted with waswāsah must adhere to the original rulings and not add to them. He must ignore the whispers and not respond to them, for responding only strengthens them.\"* (Majmū‘ al-Fatāwā 22/608).\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nYes, it is **fully acceptable** for you to ignore everything you feel on your skin after wudū’ unless there is **visible, flowing impurity** (e.g., blood or pus covering a large area). Your wudū’ is valid, and Allāh does not burden you beyond your capacity:  \n**\"Allāh does not charge a soul except [with that within] its capacity\"** (Qur’ān 2:286).\n\nStay firm, trust in Allāh’s mercy, and remember: **Perfection is for Allāh alone**. Your sincere effort is accepted, and your struggle against waswāsah is a form of worship itself. May Allāh grant you peace and cure your heart, āmīn."}

He (the Holy Prophet) said: Is there any food (with you)? They (the members of the household) said: Yes And then there were brought three loaves of bread for him (the Holy Prophet) and placed in the basket of palm leaves.

Clothing is a form of personal freedom, and no external authority should impose rigid standards.  \n\n### 2. **Cultural and Religious Context**  \n   - In some cultures or religions, clothing may follow traditional guidelines (e.g., modesty norms, specific garments like hijabs, saris, or hanboks). These choices should be respected if made voluntarily.  \n\n### 3. **Functionality and Practicality**  \n   - Clothing should suit the context:  \n     - **Professional settings** may require formal attire (e.g., suits, dresses).  \n     - **Casual or active environments** prioritize comfort (e.g., jeans, athleisure).  \n     - **Climate-adaptive clothing** (e.g., loose fabrics in heat, layers in cold).  \n\n### 4. **Societal Norms vs. Progress**  \n   - While societal expectations exist (e.g., \"dress codes\"), these are evolving. Movements like body positivity and gender-neutral fashion challenge restrictive norms, emphasizing inclusivity.  \n\n### 5. **Safety and Ethics**  \n   - Clothing should not endanger the wearer (e.g., overly restrictive garments). Ethical considerations (e.g., sustainable materials, fair labor practices) also matter.  \n\n### 6. **Historical and Artistic Expression**  \n   - Fashion has always been dynamic—from corsets to miniskirts to gender-fluid styles. Artistic creativity plays a key role in redefining \"form.\"  \n\n### Key Takeaway:  \nThere is no single \"should\" for women’s clothing. The focus should be on **agency** (women choosing for themselves), **respect** (for diverse cultural practices), and **context** (purpose, environment, and safety).  \n\n---  \n**Note on \"--T--\":**  \nIf this denotes a specific context (e.g., religious, cultural, or regional guideline), feel free to clarify for a more tailored response!"}

Samit reported:I and my father set out in search of knowledge to a tribe of the Ansar before their death (i. e. before the Companions of the Holy Prophet left the world) and I was the first to meet Abu Yasar, a Companion of Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) and there was a young man with him who carried the record of letters with him and there was a mantle prepared by the tribe of Maafiri upon him. And his servant too had a Maafiri mantle over him. My father said to him: My uncle, I see the signs of anger or that of agony on your face. He said: Yes, such and such person, the son of so and so, of the tribe of Harami owed me a debt. I went to his family, extended salutations and said: Where is he? They said: He is not here. Then came out to me his son who was at the threshold of his youth. I said to him: Where is your father? He said: No sooner did he hear your sound than he hid himself behind my mothers bedstead. I said to him: Walk out to me, for I know where you are. He came out. I said to him: What prompted you to hide yourself from me? He said: By God, whatever I would say to you would not be a lie. By Allah, I fear that I should tell a lie to you and in case of making promise with you I should break it, as you are the Companion of Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him). The fact is that I was hard up in regard to money. I said: Do you adjure by Allah? He said: I adjure by Allah. I said: Do you adjure by Allah? He said: I adjure by Allah. I said: Do you adjure by Allah? He said: I adjure by Allah. Then he brought his promissory note and he wrote off (the debt) with his hand and said: Make payment when you find yourself solvent enough to pay me back; if you are not, then there is no liability upon you. These two eyes of mine saw, and he (AbuI-Yasar) placed his fingers upon his eyes and these two ears of mine heard and my heart retained, and he pointed towards his heart that Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: He who gives time to one who is financially hard up (in the payment of debt) or writes off his debt, Allah will provide him His shadow. I said to him: My uncle, if you get the cloak of your servant and you give him your two clothes, or take his two clothes of Maafir and give him your cloak, then there would be one dress for you and one for him. He wiped my head and said: O Allah, bless the son of my brother. O, son of my brother, these two very eyes of mine saw and these two ears of mine listened to and this heart of mine retained this, and he pointed towards the heart that Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: Feed them (the servants) and clothe them (the servants) what you wear, and if I give him the goods of the world, it is easy for me than this that he should take my virtues on the Day of Resurrection. We went on till we came to Jabir b. Abdullah in the mosque and he was busy in observing prayer in one cloth which he had joined at its opposite ends. I made my way through the people till I sat between him and the Qibla and I said: May Allah have mercy upon you. Do you observe prayer with one cloth on your body whereas your mantle is lying at your side? He pointed me with his hand towards my breast just like this and he separated his fingers and bent them in the shape of a bow. And (he said): I thought that a fool like you should come to me so that he should see me as I do and he should then also do like it. Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) came to us in this very mosque and he had in his hand the twig of the palm-tree and he saw mucus towards the Qibla of the mosque and he erased it with the help of the twig. He then came to us and said: Who amongst you likes that Allah should turn His face away from him? We were afraid. He then again said: Who amongst you likes that Allah should turn His face away from him? We were afraid. He again said: Who amongst you likes that Allah should turn His face away from him? We said: Allahs Messenger, none of us likes it. And he said: If one amongst you stands for prayer, Allah, the Exalted and Glorious, is before him he should not spit in front of him, or on his right side, but should spit on his left side beneath his left foot and if he is impelled to do so all of a sudden (in spite of himself) he should then spit in his cloth and fold it in some part of it. (and he further said: ) Bring some sweet-smelling thing. A young man who belonged to our tribe stood up, went and brought scent in his palm. Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) took that and applied it to the end of that twig and then touched the place where there had been mucus. Jabir said: This is why you should apply scent to your mosques. It is reported on the same authority: We set out along with Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) on an expedition of Batn Buwat. He (the Holy Prophet) was in search of al-Majdi b. Amr al-Juhani. (We had so meagre equipment) that five. six or seven of us had one camel to ride and so we mounted it turn by turn. Once there wan. the turn of an Ansari to ride upon the camel. He made it kneel down to ride over it (and after having. mounted it), he tried to raise it up but it hesitated. So he said. May there be curse of Allah upon you! Thereupon Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: Who is there to curse his camel? He said: Allahs Messenger, it is I. Thereupon he said: Get down from the camel and let us not have in our company the cursed one. Dont curse your own selves, nor your children. nor your belongings. There is the possibility that your curse may synchronies with the time when Allah is about to confer upon you what you demand and thus your prayer may be readily responded. It is reported on the same authority: We set out on an expedition along with Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) until it was evening, and we had been near a. water reservoir of Arabia. Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: Who would be the person who would go ahead and set right the reservoir and drink water himself and serve us with it? Jabir said: I stood up and said: Allahs Messenger, it is I who am ready to do that. Thereupon Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: Who is the person to accompany Jabir? And then Jabbar b. Sakhr stood up. So we went to that well and poured in that tank a bucket or two of water and plastered it with clay and then began to fill it (with water) until it was filled to the brim. Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) was the first who appeared before us, and he said: Do you (both) permit me to drink water out of it? We said: Yea, Allahs Messenger. He led his camel to drink water and it drank. He then pulled its rein and it stretched its legs and began to urinate. He then took it aside and made it kneel down at another place and then came to the tank and performed ablution. I then got up and performed ablution like the ablution of Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him), and Jabbar b. Sakhr went in order to relieve himself and Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) got up to observe prayer and there was a mantle over me. I tried to invert its ends but it was too short (to cover my body easily). It had its borders. I then inverted it (the mantle) and drew its opposite ends and then tied them at my neck. I then came and stood upon the left side of Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him). He caught hold of me and made me go round behind him, until he made me stand on his right side. Then Jabbar b. Sakhr came. He performed ablution and then came and stood on the left side of Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him). Then Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) caught hold of our hands together, pushed us back and made us stand behind him. Then Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) began to look upon me with darting looks, but I did not perceive that. After that I became aware of it and he pointed with the gesture of his hand that I should wrap my loin-cloth. When Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) had finished the prayer, he said: Jabir! I said: Allahs Messenger, at thy beck and call. He said: When the cloth around you is inadequate, then tie the opposite ends but when it is small, tie it over the lower body. Jabir reported: We set out on an expedition with Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) and the only means of sustenance for every person amongst us was only one date for a day and we used to chew it. And we struck the leaves with the help of our bow and ate them until the sides of our mouths were injured. It so happened one day that a person was overlooked and not given a date. We carried that person and bore witness to the fact that he had not been given that date so he was offered that and he got up and received that. Jabir reported: We set out on an expedition along with Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) until we got down at a spacious valley and Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) went to relieve himself. I followed him with a bucket full of water and Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) looked about and he found no privacy but two trees at the end of the valley and Allahs Messenger (may. peace be upon him) went to one of them and took hold of one of its twigs and said: Be thou under my control by the permission of Allah, and so it came under his control like the camel who has its nosestring in the hand of its rider, and then he came to the second tree and took hold of a twig and said: Be thou under my control with the permission of Allah, and it came under his control, and when he came in the middle of the two trees he joined together the two twigs and said: join with the permission of Allah. Jabir said: I was afraid lest Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) should be aware of my nearness and go still farther. And Muhammad b. Abbad has used the word\" faitabd\" and I began to talk to myself. And as I saw, I suddenly found Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) before me and the two trees were separated and each one of them was standing at its place. I saw Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) standing for a short time, nodding his head towards right and left. Ismail pointed towards the right and left with the help of his head (in order to demonstrate how the Holy Prophet had pointed). Then he (the Holy Prophet) came to me and said: Jabir did you see my place where I was standing? I said: Allahs Messenger, yes. He then said: Then you should go to those two trees and cut a twig from each of them and go to that place with them where I was standing and stand there where I was standing and place a twig on the right and a twig on the left. Jabir said: I set out and took hold of a stone and broke it and sharpened it and then I came to those trees and cut a twig from each one of them. I then came dragging them until I stood at the place where Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) had been standing and placed a twig on the right and a twig on the left. Then I met him and said: Allahs Messenger, I have done that, but (kindly) explain to me the reason for it. Thereupon he said: I passed by two graves the occupants of which had been undergoing torment. I liked to make intercession for them so that the might be relieved of this torment y as long as these twigs remain fresh. Jabir said: We came back to the (camp of the) army and Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: Jabir, call people for per- forming wudu. I cried: Come and perform wudu, come and perform wudu, come and perform wudu. I said: Allahs Messenger, there is not even a drop of water in the army camp, and there. was a person who used to cool the water for Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) in the old water-skin which kept hanging by the twig. He asked me to go to such and such Ansari and ask him to see if there was any water in that skin. I went to him and cast a glance in it but did not find anything but a drop in the mouth of that water-skin and if I were to draw that, the water-skins,. dried part would suck it up. I came to Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) and said: Allahs Messenger, I have not found anything in it but a drop of water in the mouth of the water-skin and now if I were to draw that, it would be absorbed. He said: Go and bring that to me. I brought that to him. He took hold of it -and began to utter something which I could not understand and then pressed it with his hand and gave that to me and said: Jabir, announce for the tub to be brought. So I announced that the tub of the army (be brought). It was brought accordingly and I placed it before him (the Holy Prophet). Thereupon Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) placed his hands in the tub like this: with his fingers stretched out, and then he placed his fingers at the bottom of the tub and said: Jabir, take it (that waters-skin) and pour water over me, by reciting Bismillah, and I poured water and I said: Bismillah, and found water sprouting out between the fingers of Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him). Then that tub gushed forth until it was filled up and the Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: Jabir, make an announcement to the effect: He who needs water should take that. Jabir said: The people came and got water until they were all satiated. I said: Is there anyone left who wants to get it? And Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) then lifted up his hand from that tub and it was still full. Then the people made a complaint to Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) about hunger and he said: May Allah provide you food! We came to the bank of the ocean and the ocean was tossing and it threw out a big animal and we lit fire and cooked it and took it until we had eaten to our hearts content. Jabir said: I and such and such five persons entered Its socket and nobody could see us until we had come out, and we took hold of one of its ribs and twisted it into a sort of arch, then we called the tallest of the persons of the army and the hugest of the camels of the army and it had the big saddle over it, and it could easily pass through it without the rider having need to bend down.<D>(And he who findeth not (the wherewithal)) the means to free a slave, (let him fast for two successive months before they touch one another) before they have sexual intercourse with one another; (and for him who is unable to do so) i.e. to fast because he is weak ((the penance is) the feeding of sixty needy ones) giving each needy person half a measure (half a sa) of wheat or one measure (sa) of barley or dates. (This) which I have explained regarding the expiation of the Zihar, (that ye may put trust in Allah and His messenger) in order that you acknowledge the obligations of Allah and the wont of His Messenger. (Such are the limits (imposed by Allah)) such are the legal rulings and obligations of Allah regarding the Zihar; (and for disbelievers) in the limits imposed by Allah (is a painful doom) whose pain will extend to their hearts. From the beginning of the surah to this point was revealed about Khawlah Bint Thalabah Ibn Malikal-Ansariyyah and her husband Aws Ibn al-Samit, the brother of Ubadah Ibn al-Samit, who was angered by his wife for refusing him to sleep with her and, as a result, made sexual intercourse with her forbidden on him. But he regretted doing so, and Allah revealed how he could expiate the sin he committed. The Prophet (pbuh) told him: You should free a slave. Aws said: I have very little money and it costs a great deal to free a slave. The Prophet (pbuh) said: Then you should fast two successive months. Aws said: I cannot do so! If I do not eat once or twice a day my eyesight becomes dim; and I fear peril if I fast. The Prophet (pbuh) said: Then you should feed 60 needy ones. Aws said: I can not afford it. The Prophet (pbuh) ordered for him a measure of dates and commanded him to give it to the needy. Aws said: I do not know of anyone in Medina who is more in need of it than I. The Prophet (pbuh) told him to eat it and, with the help of another person, the Prophet (pbuh) fed 60 needy people, and this allowed Aws to go back to hiswife whom he had declared unlawful for himself. <D>(And, O my people!

Here is a concise yet comprehensive answer to your concerns, based on classical scholarship and the principles of the Hanafi madhhab (and other schools where relevant):\n\n---\n\n### **1. The Ruling on Covering the Face in Ihrām**\n- **Prohibition**: A woman in ihrām is prohibited from covering her face (e.g., with a niqāb, burqa, or any cloth intentionally fastened to cover the face). This is established by the **Ḥadīth of Ibn ʿUmar (رضي الله عنهما)**: *\"A woman in ihrām must not cover her face nor wear gloves\"* (Bukhārī, 1838).  \n- **Accidental Touching**: If the **loose edge** of a headscarf (khimār) lightly touches the face without being pinned or secured (e.g., due to wind or movement), this is **not sinful** and does not invalidate ihrām. The sin applies only to **intentional covering** (e.g., tying the cloth under the chin to conceal the face).\n\n### **2. What Is \"Ihrām Purdah\"?**\n- **Clarification**: The term \"ihrām purdah\" refers to a **loose headscarf** that drapes over the head, shoulders, and chest while leaving the face fully exposed. It is **not a bidʿah (innovation)** but a **practical way** to observe the Sunnah requirement of uncovering the face while maintaining modesty.  \n- **Cultural Variations**: While the **style** of draping may vary by culture (e.g., the Indian subcontinent’s \"ihrām purdah\" style), the **principle** of avoiding intentional face-covering is universal and rooted in the Qur’an and Sunnah. Claims that this is a \"recent Indian innovation\" are incorrect.\n\n### **3. Paying \"Dum\" (Fidyah) for Violations**\n- **Dum (Dam al-Iṣābah)**: This refers to **compensation** (fidyah) for certain unintentional violations of ihrām rules (e.g., cutting nails, covering the head accidentally). It usually involves sacrificing a sheep or feeding six poor people (Qur’an 2:196).  \n- **Important**: **Dum is not a substitute for intentional violations**. If a woman **deliberately** covers her face in ihrām, she must **stop the action immediately**, repent, and seek Allah’s forgiveness. Dum is only required for **unintentional** mistakes (e.g., forgetting and briefly covering the face in a crowded area).\n\n---\n\n### **Practical Advice for Ihrām Purdah in Haram Sharīf**\n1. **Style of Purdah**:  \n   - Wear a **large, loose headscarf** that covers your hair, neck, and chest but **does not wrap around the face**. Let it hang freely without pins or clips under the chin.  \n   - Example: Drape the scarf over your head like a **shawl**, allowing the sides to fall loosely over your shoulders (similar to how Ṣaḥābiyyāt like ʿĀʾishah رضي الله عنها would have worn it).\n\n2. **Managing Crowds in Haram Sharīf**:  \n   - If you fear overcrowding (e.g., during tawāf), you may **temporarily** pull the scarf forward to shield your face for genuine necessity (ḍarūrah). However, **uncover it as soon as the necessity passes**.  \n   - Scholars like Ibn Taymiyyah and Ibn ʿUthaymīn permitted this temporary covering **only when essential for safety or modesty** (Majmūʿ al-Fatāwā, 26/202).\n\n3. **If the Cloth Lightly Touches Your Face**:  \n   - This is **not sinful** as long as it is not intentional. Gently adjust the cloth without securing it.  \n\n4. **Final Recommendation**:  \n   - **Do wear the ihrām purdah** as it is a Sunnah-compliant way to maintain modesty while fulfilling the conditions of ihrām. Ignore claims that it is bidʿah.  \n   - **Avoid normal purdah** (e.g., niqāb or face-covering styles), as this violates ihrām rules.\n\n---\n\n### **Key Summary**\n- ✅ **Permitted**: Loose headscarf (ihrām purdah) with the face **fully exposed**.  \n- ❌ **Prohibited**: Any cloth **intentionally fastened** to cover the face (niqāb, burqa, etc.).  \n- ⚠️ **Dum (Fidyah)**: Only for **unintentional** violations, not deliberate ones.  \n- 🌙 **In Haram Sharīf**: Prioritize obeying Allah’s commands over cultural opinions.  \n\nMay Allah grant you ease, acceptance, and safety on your journey. Ameen!  \n\nWasalam,  \n[Your Virtual Assistant]  \n\n*For further details, refer to: Fatāwā al-Hindiyya (1/218), al-Mughnī (3/235), and Fatāwā Mahmūdiyyah (13/387).*"}

Here’s why, along with additional guidance:\n\n### 1. **No Risk of Contamination**\n   - Leather (including pigskin) is **processed and treated** during manufacturing. It doesn’t transfer biological residues (like oils, fats, or proteins) to other fabrics in everyday use. Unlike raw meat, cured/tanned leather is inert and stable.\n   - There’s **no health or hygiene risk** from simply touching pigskin leather to other clothing, even if you avoid pig products for religious, cultural, or ethical reasons. The tanning process removes all organic matter.\n\n### 2. **When You *Might* Wash Other Clothes (Optional)**\n   - **Personal or symbolic reasons**: If you feel uncomfortable due to cultural, religious, or ethical beliefs (e.g., keeping halal/kosher, veganism), you *could* wash the clothes for peace of mind, though it’s not required.  \n   - **Odor or stains**: If the jacket transferred dye, dirt, or smell to other clothes (unlikely but possible), wash those items normally.\n\n### 3. **Machine Washing?**\n   - **Other clothes**: Yes, machine-wash any garments as usual if desired (check care labels first).  \n   - **The leather jacket itself**: **Never machine-wash leather**—it will shrink, crack, or ruin the finish. Clean it with a damp cloth and leather conditioner, or take it to a professional cleaner.\n\n### 4. **Religious/Cultural Considerations**\n   - If this concerns you due to faith practices (e.g., Islam, Judaism), most scholars agree that **processed leather is permissible** because the tanning ritual purifies it. However, rules vary—consult a trusted religious authority if uncertain.\n\n### 5. **Practical Advice**\n   - Keep wearing the jacket if you’re comfortable—pigskin is durable, common, and not inherently \"unclean.\"  \n   - If you no longer wish to use it, consider donating or selling it rather than discarding it.\n\n**Summary**: Your clothes are fine—no washing needed. If you choose to wash them for personal reasons, follow garment care labels. Treat the leather jacket with specialized care to preserve it."}

I was told that a lady of her folk had given her a skin filled with honey as a present, and that she made a syrup from it and gave it to the Prophet to drink (and that was the reason for the delay).

Their permissibility depends on **how they’re used**.\n   - **Poker/gambling (maisir) is haram**: The Quran explicitly forbids gambling (5:90-91). If cardistry or magic tricks **do not involve betting, gambling, or wasting time in sinful activities**, they are not automatically haram.\n   - **Intention (niyyah) matters**: Since you use cards solely for art/performance and avoid gambling, this is distinguishable from haram activities.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Avoiding Suspicion (فِتْنَة) and Bad Influences**\n   - While your personal intent is pure, be mindful of:\n     - **Audience perception**: Ensure your performances don’t lead others to admire you excessively or associate you with supernatural powers (which could border on shirk).\n     - **Environment**: Avoid spaces or audiences that might pressure you into haram activities (e.g., gambling dens).\n     - **Time management**: Don’t let hobbies interfere with religious obligations (prayers, family duties, etc.).\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Scholarly Differences on Cards**\n   - Some scholars (e.g., conservative Salafi opinions) discourage **any use of playing cards** due to their association with gambling (*sadd al-dhara’i*—blocking the means to sin). However, this is a precautionary view, not a consensus.\n   - The **majority of contemporary scholars** differentiate between **sinful use** (gambling) and **halal use** (art, skill-building, or wholesome entertainment), especially if there’s no harm or temptation.\n\n---\n\n### Final Advice\n- **Continue your practices** since:\n  - Your **intention** is halal (fun, art, not gambling).\n  - You **avoid shirk** and supernatural claims.\n  - You **fulfill your religious duties** (prayers, etc.).\n- **Stay cautious**: Regularly renew your niyyah and avoid settings that could normalize haram behavior.\n- **Consult trusted scholars**: If doubts arise, seek advice from knowledgeable, open-minded ustaz who understand the context of your art.\n\nAllah knows best, and your conscious effort to align your actions with faith is commendable.

Even if you are not actively choosing the ads, hosting them on your site could constitute implicit endorsement or benefit from haram content, which is impermissible.\n\n2. **Principle of \"Blocking the Means\" (سَدُّ الذَّرَائِعِ)**:  \n   Islam requires Muslims to avoid actions that may lead to sin, even indirectly. Allowing uncontrolled ads—some of which may promote haram—could fall under this principle, as your platform becomes a means for others to access forbidden content.\n\n3. **Accountability for What You Control**:  \n   While you cannot control the ads directly, you *are* responsible for choosing a platform that imposes them. If alternatives exist (e.g., upgrading to remove ads or switching hosts), you are obligated to pursue those options to avoid complicity in haram.\n\n4. **Professional Integrity**:  \n   As a medical website, displaying irrelevant or inappropriate ads (e.g., gambling) could harm your credibility and distract from your mission of providing trustworthy health information.\n\n---\n\n### Recommended Actions:\n1. **Upgrade to WordPress’s \"No-Ads\" Plan**:  \n   - Paying to remove ads is the simplest solution if you wish to stay with WordPress. Though it involves a cost, it eliminates your association with haram content and aligns with Islamic obligations to purify your income.  \n   - **Islamic Perspective**: The fee can be viewed as an investment in maintaining halal integrity, which takes priority over financial considerations.\n\n2. **Switch to a Different Host**:  \n   - If the upgrade fee is unaffordable, migrate to a hosting service that does not impose third-party ads. Options include:  \n     - **Free hosts with no ads**: Some platforms (e.g., InfinityFree, 000webhost) offer free hosting without forced ads, though they may have limitations.  \n     - **Low-cost halal-friendly hosts**: Providers like Hostinger or SiteGround offer affordable plans (often under $3/month) with full control over ads.  \n   - Ensure the new host complies with your ethical and religious standards.\n\n3. **Self-Hosted WordPress (WordPress.org)**:  \n   - For full control, consider self-hosting your site using WordPress.org (free software) + a halal-compliant hosting provider (e.g., Bluehost, A2 Hosting). This allows you to:  \n     - Monetize your site ethically (e.g., through halal ads or donations).  \n     - Avoid unwanted content entirely.  \n\n4. **Consult a Scholar for Specific Guidance**:  \n   If uncertain, discuss your situation with a trusted Islamic scholar who specializes in modern fiqh (jurisprudence). They can evaluate your intent, financial capacity, and alternatives to provide a tailored ruling.\n\n---\n\n### Final Advice:\n**It is necessary to cease allowing haram ads on your site**, either by upgrading your WordPress plan or switching hosts. Continuation without action risks sin due to indirect involvement in haram. Prioritize finding a solution that aligns with your faith, even if it requires financial sacrifice or effort. Remember: Allah rewards those who strive to uphold His boundaries, and purifying your income is a form of worship.\n\nMay Allah make it easy for you and reward your efforts to seek a halal solution."}

But he regretted doing so, and Allah revealed how he could expiate the sin he committed. The Prophet (pbuh) told him: You should free a slave. Aws said: I have very little money and it costs a great deal to free a slave. The Prophet (pbuh) said: Then you should fast two successive months. Aws said: I cannot do so! If I do not eat once or twice a day my eyesight becomes dim; and I fear peril if I fast. The Prophet (pbuh) said: Then you should feed 60 needy ones. Aws said: I can not afford it. The Prophet (pbuh) ordered for him a measure of dates and commanded him to give it to the needy. Aws said: I do not know of anyone in Medina who is more in need of it than I. The Prophet (pbuh) told him to eat it and, with the help of another person, the Prophet (pbuh) fed 60 needy people, and this allowed Aws to go back to hiswife whom he had declared unlawful for himself. ", "Generated_Answer": "The permissibility of wearing a tie in Islam is a topic that has been debated among scholars, primarily due to concerns about **imitation of non-Muslims (tashabbuh)** and interpretations of modesty. Here's a balanced overview to help clarify the issue:\n\n---\n\n### **Key Islamic Perspectives**\n1. **Majority View: Permissible**  \n   Most contemporary scholars (including institutions like Al-Azhar and mainstream fatwa councils) consider ties **halal** as long as they:  \n   - Are not symbols of a specific non-Muslim religious group (e.g., clerical collars).  \n   - Do not violate Islamic modesty (e.g., they aren’t excessively flashy or tight-fitting).  \n   - Are worn for professional necessity, not imitation.  \n\n   Ties are widely viewed as **cultural attire**, not inherently religious. Thus, wearing one for work—especially in a halal job—is generally acceptable.\n\n2. **Minority View: Discouraged or Forbidden**  \n   Some conservative scholars (e.g., certain Salafi schools) argue ties are a Western innovation resembling the **cross** (due to their shape) or symbolize non-Muslim elites. They may advise avoiding them to prevent assimilation into non-Islamic cultures. However, this opinion is not universally accepted.\n\n---\n\n### **Practical Guidance**\n- **Halal Job Priority**: Focus first on whether the **job itself** aligns with Islamic principles (e.g., no haram industries like alcohol, gambling, interest-based finance). If the job is halal, a tie is unlikely to invalidate its permissibility.  \n- **Intention Matters**: If wearing a tie is purely for professional etiquette (not religious or cultural imitation), most scholars see no issue.  \n- **Alternatives**: If uncomfortable, discuss alternatives with your employer (e.g., a modest suit without a tie, or a Muslim-style collar). Many workplaces accommodate religious dress codes.  \n\n---\n\n### **Should You Quit Your Job?**\nQuitting a halal job solely over a tie requirement is **not necessary** according to mainstream scholarship, unless:  \n1. You sincerely believe it violates your faith (based on a trusted scholar’s advice).  \n2. The job forces you into *other* haram actions (e.g., free mixing without modesty).  \n\n---\n\n### **Final Advice**\n1. **Consult a Local Scholar**: Reach out to an imam or knowledgeable figure who understands your context.  \n2. **Balance Priorities**: Islam encourages earning a halal livelihood. If your job is otherwise permissible, prioritize maintaining it while seeking permissible alternatives for attire.  \n3. **Avoid Extremes**: Neither rigidly rejecting cultural norms nor blindly imitating them is ideal. Focus on moderation (Quran 2:143).  \n\nIf your job is halal and the tie is the only concern, most Muslims would advise staying and seeking flexibility or spiritual reassurance. May Allah guide you to what is best! 🤲"}

", "Generated_Answer": "The permissibility of dental implants in Islam (whether it is **halal** or **haram**) is generally determined by Islamic principles related to health, necessity, and the materials used. Here’s a breakdown based on scholarly opinions:\n\n---\n\n### **Key Considerations**:\n1. **Material of the Implant**:\n   - If the implant is made from **halal, pure, and non-toxic materials** (e.g., titanium, ceramic, or synthetic materials not derived from haram sources like pigs), it is widely considered permissible.\n   - If the material contains **impurities or haram substances** (e.g., animal derivatives from non-halal sources), it would be impermissible unless there is no alternative and it is medically necessary.\n\n2. **Medical Necessity**:\n   - Islam encourages maintaining health and treating ailments. Dental implants are often used to restore function (chewing, speech) and prevent health issues (e.g., bone loss, misalignment). If the procedure is **medically necessary**, it is generally allowed.\n   - For purely **cosmetic purposes** (e.g., replacing a healthy tooth for aesthetics), scholars may discourage it unless there is a valid psychological or social need.\n\n3. **Permanence**:\n   - Dental implants are **permanent prosthetics**, which distinguishes them from temporary solutions like dentures. Permanent medical interventions are generally acceptable in Islam if they serve a legitimate health purpose.\n\n4. **Scholarly Consensus**:\n   - Most contemporary scholars and fatwa councils (e.g., Al-Azhar, Islamic Fiqh Academy) **permit dental implants** if the above conditions are met. They classify it under permissible medical treatment, citing the Prophet’s (PBUH) encouragement to seek cures (Sunan Ibn Majah 3438).\n\n---\n\n### **When Could It Be Problematic?**\n- If the implant uses **haram materials** (e.g., porcine-derived bone grafts or coatings) without alternatives.\n- If the procedure involves **unnecessary harm** (e.g., risky surgery without a qualified professional).\n- If done purely for **vanity** without a genuine need.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommended Steps for Muslims**:\n1. **Consult a Knowledgeable Scholar**: Ensure the procedure aligns with Islamic guidelines in your specific context.\n2. **Verify Implant Materials**: Confirm with your dentist that all materials are halal and safe.\n3. **Prioritize Necessity Over Cosmetic Desire**: Opt for implants only if there is a functional or health-related need.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**:\nDental implants are **halal (permissible)** in Islam **provided**:\n- The materials are halal and non-toxic.\n- The procedure is medically necessary or significantly beneficial.\n- There is no viable halal alternative.\n\nIf in doubt, seek guidance from a trusted Islamic scholar or a fatwa council to address your specific situation.\n\n*Note: This is a general Islamic perspective; individual rulings may vary based on school of thought (Madhhab) and context.*"}

She used a girdle so that she might hide her tracks from Sarah. Abraham brought her and her son Ishmael while she was suckling him, to a place near the Ka`ba under a tree on the spot of Zamzam, at the highest place in the mosque. During those days there was nobody in Mecca, nor was there any water So he made them sit over there and placed near them a leather bag containing some dates, and a small water-skin containing some water, and set out homeward. Ishmaels mother followed him saying, \"O Abraham! Where are you going, leaving us in this valley where there is no person whose company we may enjoy, nor is there anything (to enjoy)?\" She repeated that to him many times, but he did not look back at her Then she asked him, \"Has Allah ordered you to do so?\" He said, \"Yes.\" She said, \"Then He will not neglect us,\" and returned while Abraham proceeded onwards, and on reaching the Thaniya where they could not see him, he faced the Ka`ba, and raising both hands, invoked Allah saying the following prayers: O our Lord! I have made some of my offspring dwell in a valley without cultivation, by Your Sacred House (Ka`ba at Mecca) in order, O our Lord, that they may offer prayer perfectly. So fill some hearts among men with love towards them, and (O Allah) provide them with fruits, so that they may give thanks. (14.37) Ishmaels mother went on suckling Ishmael and drinking from the water (she had). When the water in the water-skin had all been used up, she became thirsty and her child also became thirsty. She started looking at him (i.e. Ishmael) tossing in agony; She left him, for she could not endure looking at him, and found that the mountain of Safa was the nearest mountain to her on that land. She stood on it and started looking at the valley keenly so that she might see somebody, but she could not see anybody. Then she descended from Safa and when she reached the valley, she tucked up her robe and ran in the valley like a person in distress and trouble, till she crossed the valley and reached the Marwa mountain where she stood and started looking, expecting to see somebody, but she could not see anybody. She repeated that (running between Safa and Marwa) seven times.\" The Prophet said, \"This is the source of the tradition of the walking of people between them (i.e. Safa and Marwa). When she reached the Marwa (for the last time) she heard a voice and she asked herself to be quiet and listened attentively. She heard the voice again and said, O, (whoever you may be)! You have made me hear your voice; have you got something to help me?\" And behold! She saw an angel at the place of Zamzam, digging the earth with his heel (or his wing), till water flowed from that place. She started to make something like a basin around it, using her hand in this way, and started filling her water-skin with water with her hands, and the water was flowing out after she had scooped some of it.\" The Prophet added, \"May Allah bestow Mercy on Ishmaels mother! Had she let the Zamzam (flow without trying to control it) (or had she not scooped from that water) (to fill her water-skin), Zamzam would have been a stream flowing on the surface of the earth.\" The Prophet further added, \"Then she drank (water) and suckled her child. The angel said to her, Dont be afraid of being neglected, for this is the House of Allah which will be built by this boy and his father, and Allah never neglects His people. The House (i.e. Ka`ba) at that time was on a high place resembling a hillock, and when torrents came, they flowed to its right and left. She lived in that way till some people from the tribe of Jurhum or a family from Jurhum passed by her and her child, as they (i.e. the Jurhum people) were coming through the way of Kada. They landed in the lower part of Mecca where they saw a bird that had the habit of flying around water and not leaving it. They said, This bird must be flying around water, though we know that there is no water in this valley. They sent one or two messengers who discovered the source of water, and returned to inform them of the water. So, they all came (towards the water).\" The Prophet added, \"Ishmaels mother was sitting near the water. They asked her, Do you allow us to stay with you?\" She replied, Yes, but you will have no right to possess the water. They agreed to that.\" The Prophet further said, \"Ishmaels mother was pleased with the whole situation as she used to love to enjoy the company of the people. So, they settled there, and later on they sent for their families who came and settled with them so that some families became permanent residents there. The child (i.e. Ishmael) grew up and learnt Arabic from them and (his virtues) caused them to love and admire him as he grew up, and when he reached the age of puberty they made him marry a woman from amongst them. After Ishmaels mother had died, Abraham came after Ishmaels marriage in order to see his family that he had left before, but he did not find Ishmael there. When he asked Ishmaels wife about him, she replied, He has gone in search of our livelihood. Then he asked her about their way of living and their condition, and she replied, We are living in misery; we are living in hardship and destitution, complaining to him. He said, When your husband returns, convey my salutation to him and tell him to change the threshold of the gate (of his house). When Ishmael came, he seemed to have felt something unusual, so he asked his wife, Has anyone visited you? She replied, Yes, an old man of so-and-so description came and asked me about you and I informed him, and he asked about our state of living, and I told him that we were living in a hardship and poverty. On that Ishmael said, Did he advise you anything? She replied, Yes, he told me to convey his salutation to you and to tell you to change the threshold of your gate. Ishmael said, It was my father, and he has ordered me to divorce you. Go back to your family. So, Ishmael divorced her and married another woman from amongst them (i.e. Jurhum). Then Abraham stayed away from them for a period as long as Allah wished and called on them again but did not find Ishmael. So he came to Ishmaels wife and asked her about Ishmael. She said, He has gone in search of our livelihood. Abraham asked her, How are you getting on? asking her about their sustenance and living. She replied, We are prosperous and well-off (i.e. we have everything in abundance). Then she thanked Allah Abraham said, What kind of food do you eat? She said. Meat. He said, What do you drink? She said, Water.\" He said, \"O Allah! Bless their meat and water.\" The Prophet added, \"At that time they did not have grain, and if they had grain, he would have also invoked Allah to bless it.\" The Prophet added, \"If somebody has only these two things as his sustenance, his health and disposition will be badly affected, unless he lives in Mecca.\" The Prophet added,\" Then Abraham said Ishmaels wife, \"When your husband comes, give my regards to him and tell him that he should keep firm the threshold of his gate. When Ishmael came back, he asked his wife, Did anyone call on you? She replied, Yes, a good-looking old man came to me, so she praised him and added. He asked about you, and I informed him, and he asked about our livelihood and I told him that we were in a good condition. Ishmael asked her, Did he give you any piece of advice? She said, Yes, he told me to give his regards to you and ordered that you should keep firm the threshold of your gate. On that Ishmael said, It was my father, and you are the threshold (of the gate). He has ordered me to keep you with me. Then Abraham stayed away from them for a period as long as Allah wished, and called on them afterwards. He saw Ishmael under a tree near Zamzam, sharpening his arrows. When he saw Abraham, he rose up to welcome him (and they greeted each other as a father does with his son or a son does with his father). Abraham said, O Ishmael! Allah has given me an order. Ishmael said, Do what your Lord has ordered you to do. Abraham asked, Will you help me? Ishmael said, I will help you. Abraham said, Allah has ordered me to build a house here, pointing to a hillock higher than the land surrounding it.\" The Prophet added, \"Then they raised the foundations of the House (i.e. the Ka`ba). Ishmael brought the stones and Abraham was building, and when the walls became high, Ishmael brought this stone and put it for Abraham who stood over it and carried on building, while Ishmael was handing him the stones, and both of them were saying, O our Lord! Accept (this service) from us, Verily, You are the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing. The Prophet added, \"Then both of them went on building and going round the Ka`ba saying: O our Lord !

This cupbearer saw in a dream that he entered a vineyard and there he saw a pleasant bough with three offshoots and on the offshoots bunches of grapes. He picked the grapes, pressed them and gave it to the King. Joseph said: As for the vineyard, it is the job you had; the bough represents the expertise you have in your job; its pleasantness represents your position and merit in that job.

Joseph said: You have seen an evil thing. As for your going out of the Kings kitchen, this means that you will lose your job; the three basketsmeans that you will stay in prison for three days. The birds eating from the baskets means that the king will get you out of prison in three days to crucify you and the birds will eat of your head. Before Joseph interpreted their dreams for them, the two men said to him: (Announce unto us the interpretation) interpret for us our dreams, (for we see thee of those good) towards the prisoners; it is also said that this means:you are of those who are truthful in their speech. <D>(Then changed We the evil plight for good) We replaced drought and lack of fruit with fertility, abundance and comfort (till they grew affluent and said: Tribulation and distress did touch our fathers) as they have touched us, but they held firm to their religion.

Here’s a breakdown based on Islamic principles:\n\n---\n\n### 1. **Birth Control (Contraception)**\n   - **Generally Permissible**: Islam allows contraception (e.g., non-abortive pills, condoms) if used for valid reasons (e.g., health, financial stability, child spacing) with mutual spousal consent. Scholars like Ibn Baaz and Ibn Uthaymeen permitted temporary contraception.\n   - **Caveat**: Promoting birth control is **not inherently forbidden**, as long as the methods are temporary and do not cause harm or permanent sterilization (unless medically necessary).\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Abortion Drugs**\n   - **Strictly Restricted in Islam**: Abortion is prohibited except in **exceptional cases**, such as when the mother’s life is at risk (and only before the soul is breathed into the fetus, generally considered at **120 days/4 months**). Even early-term abortion is discouraged unless justified by Sharīʿah-approved reasons.\n   - **Working for Abortion-Related Products**: Promoting, producing, or selling abortion medications is widely regarded as **haram (forbidden)** by scholars, as it facilitates the termination of a life without valid justification.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **General Islamic Guidelines**\n   - **Avoid Supporting Haram Activities**: If your role directly or indirectly contributes to abortion services, many scholars would advise against the job. Islam emphasizes avoiding partnership in sin (Quran 5:2).\n   - **Indirect Involvement**: If your job is unrelated to controversial products (e.g., IT, accounting, non-abortion medicines), some scholars may permit it, while others urge caution to avoid even indirect association with haram.\n   - **Necessity (Ḍarūrah)**: If you’re in financial hardship and no halal alternatives exist, concessions might apply, but this requires careful evaluation by a qualified scholar.\n\n---\n\n### Key Considerations:\n   - **Your Role**: Are you directly involved in promoting/selling abortion drugs, or is your work tangential (e.g., HR, logistics for non-controversial products)?\n   - **Intention (Niyyah)**: Would this job compel you to compromise your values?\n   - **Alternatives**: Seek halal income sources where possible (Quran 2:168).\n\n---\n\n### Final Advice:\n   - **Consult a trusted local scholar** who understands your circumstances and can weigh Islamic principles against your role’s specifics.\n   - If the company’s core work involves abortion, most scholars would advise **avoiding it** due to the gravity of supporting harm to unborn life.

Some certifiers allow reversible stunning (e.g., electric or gas), but this is debated.  \n4. **Avoid Cross-Contamination**: Tools, surfaces, and processing must not contact non-halal substances (e.g., pork, alcohol).  \n\n### Can We Trust Others About Halal Status?  \nTrust depends on **verification**, not blind acceptance:  \n\n1. **Certification from Reputable Bodies**:  \n   - Trustworthy halal certifications (e.g., ISWA, IFANCA, HMC, JAKIM) audit slaughterhouses, ingredients, and processes.  \n   - Always check for a valid, recognizable halal logo on packaging or premises.  \n\n2. **Personal Knowledge of the Source**:  \n   - If buying from a local butcher or restaurant, ensure they are known for integrity and Islamic adherence.  \n   - Ask for proof of certification or details about their slaughter process.  \n\n3. **Doubtful Situations**:  \n   - In non-Muslim-majority countries, fraud or cross-contamination risks are higher.  \n   - If no certification exists and the provider’s credibility is unclear, Islamic principles advise caution (avoiding doubtful matters).  \n\n4. **Scholarly Opinion**:  \n   - Scholars emphasize verifying halal claims where possible (Quran 5:3, 6:118–119).  \n   - If trust is established through reliable certification or a pious Muslim’s testimony, consumption is permissible.  \n\n### Key Takeaways:  \n- **Trust but Verify**: Rely on credible certifications or trustworthy witnesses.  \n- **Avoid Uncertainty**: When in doubt, choose an alternative with clear halal credentials.  \n- **Community Networks**: Seek recommendations from local mosques or Muslim communities for trusted sources.  \n\nUltimately, while trust in others is part of Islamic ethics, due diligence aligns with the Quranic command to \"eat of that over which Allah’s name has been mentioned\" (6:118)."}

Here’s a balanced perspective to help clarify:\n\n### 1. **Psychological and Neurological Factors**\n   - **Involuntary Expressions:** Many facial reactions are subconscious or biologically wired (e.g., nervous tics, micro-expressions, or reactions to stress). Conditions like social anxiety, autism, ADHD, or neurological differences can cause people to display expressions that seem \"strange\" or mismatched to the conversation, even if they’re genuinely engaged.\n   - **Mental Health:** Depression, trauma, or dissociation might lead to flat or incongruent facial expressions. This isn’t insincerity but a reflection of internal struggles.\n   - **Neurodivergence:** People with autism, for example, may not conform to typical social cues (e.g., avoiding eye contact or smiling at \"inappropriate\" times) due to differences in brain processing, not deceit.\n\n### 2. **Social and Cultural Influences**\n   - **Mismatched Social Cues:** Cultural norms heavily influence facial expressions. What seems \"strange\" in one context might be neutral or polite in another (e.g., forced smiles in uncomfortable situations).\n   - **Learned Behavior:** Some people unconsciously adopt facial habits (e.g., resting \"annoyed\" face) due to upbringing or environment, not hypocrisy.\n\n### 3. **Hypocrisy or Insincerity?**\n   - **Facial expressions alone are rarely reliable indicators of hypocrisy.** While forced smiles or avoidant glances *might* signal discomfort or dishonesty, they could equally stem from shyness, insecurity, or a desire to avoid conflict. Hypocrisy involves a deliberate contradiction between actions and beliefs—something far deeper than fleeting facial cues.\n   - **Insincerity** often reveals itself through inconsistent *behavior* or speech over time, not isolated facial quirks.\n\n### 4. **Moral/Spiritual Perspectives (e.g., \"Sins Done with the Face\")**\n   - In religious frameworks, hypocrisy or deceit is often condemned, but facial expressions themselves aren’t inherently sinful. Intent matters: a \"strange look\" caused by a neurological condition or stress isn’t sinful, whereas deliberate malicious expressions (e.g., mocking sneers) could align with unethical intent.\n   - Many faith traditions emphasize judging actions and hearts—not appearances (e.g., \"Man looks at the outward appearance, but the Lord looks at the heart,\" 1 Samuel 16:7). Thus, attributing facial quirks to \"sin\" risks uncharitable judgment without context.\n\n### 5. **Practical Advice**\n   - **Avoid Assumptions:** Give others the benefit of the doubt. What you perceive as \"annoying\" may be unintentional or beyond their control.\n   - **Communicate Gently:** If someone’s expression bothers you, consider kindly asking, \"Are you okay? You seem distracted.\" This opens dialogue without accusation.\n   - **Self-Reflect:** Ask yourself why these expressions bother you. Is it past experiences with deceit? Projecting insecurity? Understanding your reaction may help you respond more empathetically.\n\n### Key Takeaway\nStrange facial expressions are far more likely tied to involuntary psychological, neurological, or cultural factors than hypocrisy or moral failings. While insincerity exists, it’s best assessed through patterns of behavior—not isolated facial cues. Approach others with curiosity and compassion rather than suspicion. If this issue causes you significant distress, discussing it with a counselor could provide deeper insight."}

However, the reasoning you describe—that women are \"more emotional than men\" and thus should not attend—is **not rooted in authentic Islamic teachings** and indeed contradicts the compassionate and equitable spirit of the faith.\n\n### Key Islamic Evidence on Women's Attendance at Funerals:\n1. **Hadith Evidence Permitting Women's Presence:**\n   - Umm ‘Atiyyah (رضي الله عنها) reported: *\"We were forbidden to follow funeral processions, but not strictly.\"* (Sahih al-Bukhari). This indicates that while it was discouraged (*makruh tanzīhī*), it was **not forbidden** (*haram*). The Prophet (ﷺ) did not outright prohibit women from attending funerals but advised moderation to avoid excessive emotional distress.\n   - The Prophet (ﷺ) once saw a woman weeping at a grave and said: *\"Fear Allah and be patient.\"* (Sahih al-Bukhari). This shows he acknowledged women's presence at gravesites and advised patience, not exclusion.\n\n2. **Scholarly Views:**\n   - **Hanafi and Shafi'i Schools:** Permit women to attend funerals and burials, provided they maintain modesty and avoid excessive weeping or wailing (*niyāḥah*), which is prohibited for both men and women.\n   - **Maliki and Hanbali Schools:** Discourage (*makruh*) women from attending burials due to concerns about emotional turmoil, but they do not declare it sinful. This is a precaution, not a prohibition.\n   - **Modern Scholars:** Many contemporary scholars (e.g., Yusuf al-Qaradawi, Omar Suleiman) emphasize that women should not be barred from grieving or saying farewell to loved ones, as long as Islamic etiquette is observed.\n\n3. **The Emotional Argument Is Flawed:**\n   - Islam does not discriminate based on emotional sensitivity. Both men and women are urged to show patience (*ṣabr*) and dignity in grief (Quran 2:155–157). The Prophet (ﷺ) himself wept at funerals, demonstrating that emotions are human, not gendered.\n   - Reducing women’s spiritual and emotional needs to stereotypes contradicts Islam’s emphasis on justice and compassion. The Quran praises women for their strength and resilience (e.g., Maryam, Asiyah, Khadijah رضي الله عنهن).\n\n### Practical Guidance:\n- **Women May Attend:** According to the majority view, women can attend burials if they wish, especially for close relatives (parents, children, siblings). The focus should be on sincere mourning, supplication (*du’a*), and reflection on death.\n- **Avoid Prohibited Practices:** All attendees—men and women—must avoid loud wailing, tearing clothes, or other acts of despair that contradict Islamic teachings on accepting Allah’s decree.\n- **Community Sensitivity:** While some communities discourage women’s presence out of cultural norms (misattributed to Islam), this should not override the Sharīʿah’s flexibility. Gently educate others using Quranic and Hadith evidence.\n\n### Final Advice:\nYour frustration is valid. The statement you describe is culturally driven, not Islamic, and risks alienating women from their right to communal grieving. Islam prioritizes kindness (*rifq*) and support for the bereaved, regardless of gender. If possible, discuss this with a knowledgeable and compassionate scholar or imam in your community to address misunderstandings respectfully.\n\nMay Allah grant patience and mercy to the deceased sister and her child, and unite the hearts of your community on guidance.  \n**\"Indeed, to Allah we belong and to Him we shall return.\"** (Quran 2:156)"}
{"Question": "I have a question regarding the legality of hanging African style masks on the wall as decoration. Is it permissible? Does it matter on how much detail the mask face has? These masks are usually a stylized face mask. Sometimes the facial features are generalized and other times they are quite detailed. ? --T--", "Answer": "Assalamu alaikum,It would be disliked (makruh) to hang such masks, for two reasons:a) they are close representations of the face (even if only in a stylized manner). Representing the face itself is not permitted. That which is similar to the impermissible is at least disliked;b) masks very often have religious significance, particularly in African cultures, as the article below from the Encyclopdia Britannica shows. We have been commanded to avoid the religious symbols and imagery of other religions., and He alone gives success.Wassalam,Faraz Rabbani It is mentioned in the Encyclopdia Britannicathat:The functions and forms of masksMasks are as extraordinarily varied in appearance as they are in function or fundamental meaning. Many masks are primarily associated with ceremonies that have religious and social significance or are concerned with funerary customs, fertility rites, or curing sickness. Other masks are used on festive occasions or to portray characters in a dramatic performance and in re-enactments of mythological events. Masks are also used for warfare and as protective devices in certain sports, as well as frequently being employed as architectural ornament.Social and religious usesMasks representing potentially harmful spirits were often used to keep a required balance of power or a traditional relationship of inherited positions within a culture. The forms of these masks invariably were prescribed by tradition, as were their uses. This type of mask was often associated with secret societies, especially in Africa, where the greatest range of types and functions can be found. They were also widely used among Oceanic peoples of the South Pacific and the American Indians and are even used in some of the folk rites still performed in Europe.Masks have served an important role as a means of discipline and have been used to admonish women, children, and criminals. Common in China, Africa, Oceania, and North America, admonitory masks usually completely cover the features of the wearer. It is believed among some of the African Negro tribes that the first mask was an admonitory one. A child, repeatedly told not to, persisted in following its mother to fetch water. To frighten and discipline the child, the mother painted a hideous face on the bottom of her water gourd. Others say the mask was invented by a secret African society to escape recognition while punishing marauders. In New Britain, members of a secret terroristic society called the Dukduk appear in monstrous five-foot masks to police, to judge, and to execute offenders. Aggressive supernatural spirits of an almost demonic nature are represented by these masks, which are constructed from a variety of materials, usually including tapa, or bark cloth, and the pith of certain reeds. These materials are painted in brilliant colours, with brick red and acid green predominating.In many cultures throughout the world, a judge wears a mask to protect him from future recriminations. In this instance, the mask represents a traditionally sanctioned spirit from the past who assumes responsibility for the decision levied on the culprit.Rituals, often nocturnal, by members of secret societies wearing ancestor masks are reminders of the ancient sanction of their conduct. In many cultures, these masked ceremonials are intended to prevent miscreant acts and to maintain the circumscribed activities of the tribe. Along the Guinea coast of West Africa, for instance, many highly realistic masks represent ancestors who enjoyed specific cultural roles; the masks symbolize sanction and control when donned by the wearer. Among some of the Dan and Ngere tribes of Liberia and Ivory Coast, ancestor masks with generic features act as intermediaries for the transmission of petitions or offerings of respect to the gods. These traditional ancestral emissaries exert by their spirit power a social control for the community.Particularly among Oceanic peoples, American Indians, and Negro tribes of Africa, certain times of the year are set aside to honour spirits or ancestors. Among non literate peoples who cannot record their own histories, masked rituals act as an important link between past and present, giving a sense of historic continuity that strengthens their social bond. On these occasions, masks usually recognizable as dead chieftains, relatives, friends, or even foes are worn or exhibited. Gifts are made to the spirits incarnated in the masks, while in other instances dancers wearing stylized mourning masks perform the prescribed ceremony.In western Melanesia, the ancestral ceremonial mask occurs in a great variety of forms and materials. The Sepik River area in north central New Guinea is the source of an extremely rich array of these mask forms mostly carved in wood, ranging from small faces to large fantastic forms with a variety of appendages affixed to the wood, including shell, fibre, animal skins, seed, flowers, and feathers. These masks are highly polychromed with earth colours of red and yellow, lime white, and charcoal black. They often represent supernatural spirits as well as ancestors and therefore have both a religious and a social significance.Members of secret societies usually conduct the rituals of initiation, when a young man is instructed in his future role as an adult and is acquainted with the rules controlling the social stability of the tribe. Totem and spiritualistic masks are donned by the elders at these ceremonies. Sometimes the masks used are reserved only for initiations. Among the most impressive of the initiation masks are the exquisitely carved human faces of west coast African Negro tribes. In western and central Congo (Kinshasa), in Africa, large, colourful helmet like masks are used as a masquerading device when the youth emerges from the initiation area and is introduced to the villagers as an adult of the tribe. After a lengthy ordeal of teaching and initiation rites, for instance, a youth of the Pende tribe appears in a distinctive colourful mask indicative of his new role as an adult. The mask is later cast aside and replaced by a small ivory duplicate, worn as a charm against misfortune and as a symbol of his manhood.Believing everything in nature to possess a spirit, man found authority for himself and his family by identifying with a specific nonhuman spirit. He adopted an object of nature; then he mythologically traced his ancestry back to the chosen object; he preempted the animal as the emblem of himself and his clan. This is the practice of totem, which consolidates family pride and distinguishes social lines. Masks are made to house the totem spirit. The totem ancestor is believed actually to materialize in its mask; thus masks are of the utmost importance in securing protection and bringing comfort to the totem clan.The Papuans of New Guinea build mammoth masks called hevehe,attaining 20 feet in height. They are constructed of a palm wood armature covered in bark cloth; geometric designs are stitched on with painted cane strips. These fantastic mananimal masks are given a frightening aspect. When they emerge from the mens secret clubhouse, they serve to protect the members of the clan. The so-called totem pole of the Alaskan and British Columbian Indian fulfills the same function. The African totem mask is often carved from ebony or other hard woods, designed with graceful lines and showing a highly polished surface. Animal masks, their features elongated and beautifully formalized, are common in western Africa. Dried grass, woven palm fibres, coconuts, and shells, as well as wood are employed in the masks of New Guinea, New Ireland, and New Caledonia. Represented are fanciful birds, fishes, and animals with distorted or exaggerated features.The high priest and medicine man, or the shaman, frequently had his own very powerful totem, in whose mask he could exorcise evil spirits, punish enemies, locate game or fish, predict the weather, and, most importantly, cure disease.The Northwest Coast Indians of North America in particular devised mechanical masks with movable parts to reveal a second facegenerally a human image. Believing that the human spirit could take animal form and vice versa, the makers of these masks fused man and bird or man and animal into one mask. Some of these articulating masks acted out entire legends as their parts moved.[Copyright1994-2002 Encyclopdia Britannica, Inc", "Document": "Zaid bin Khalid al-Juhani said :A man asked the Messenger of Allah (SWAS) about a find.

", "Generated_Answer": "The legality and ethical considerations of hanging African-style masks as decoration depend on several factors, including the mask's origin, cultural context, and applicable laws. Here's a breakdown:\n\n---\n\n### **1. Legal Considerations**\n   - **Authenticity and Cultural Heritage Laws**:\n     - If the mask is an **authentic artifact** (especially if antique or historically significant), it may fall under international or national cultural heritage protections. Many African countries have laws restricting the export or sale of cultural objects (e.g., Nigeria's *National Commission for Museums and Monuments Act* or UNESCO conventions).\n     - Purchasing or owning such items **without provenance** (documented legal export history) could violate laws like the U.S. *National Stolen Property Act* or EU regulations on cultural property.\n     - **Modern reproductions or mass-produced decor masks** (sold as handicrafts or souvenirs) are generally legal to own and display, provided they were ethically sourced.\n\n   - **Intellectual Property/Copyright**:\n     - Some traditional designs may be protected under intellectual property laws (e.g., Ghana’s *Copyright Act* safeguards folklore and traditional knowledge). However, this rarely applies to personal display unless you profit from replicas.\n\n   - **Detail Level**:  \n     The mask's artistic detail (stylized vs. detailed) typically **does not affect legality**. What matters is whether it is an authentic cultural artifact or a modern reproduction.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Ethical and Cultural Sensitivity**\n   - **Sacred or Ritual Significance**:  \n     Many African masks hold spiritual, ceremonial, or communal meaning (e.g., used in initiations, funerals, or festivals). Displaying such items without understanding their context could be seen as disrespectful or appropriative, even if legally permissible.\n     - Example: Dan masks (Liberia/Ivory Coast) or Bamileke masks (Cameroon) often have sacred roles.\n   - **Supporting Ethical Artisans**:  \n     If buying new, prioritize masks made by African artisans or cooperatives (e.g., through fair-trade organizations). Avoid mass-produced imitations that exploit cultural symbols without compensation.\n\n---\n\n### **Key Questions to Ask Yourself**\n1. **Provenance**: Is the mask an antique with unclear origins? If so, it may be illicitly trafficked cultural property.  \n2. **Purpose**: Was it created as art/decor, or does it serve a traditional function?  \n3. **Source**: Was it purchased from a reputable seller (e.g., a contemporary African artist or ethical retailer)?  \n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations**\n- **For Legal Safety**:  \n  Stick to modern, mass-produced decorative masks or verified contemporary art. Avoid antiques unless you have proof of legal export.  \n- **For Ethical Practices**:  \n  Research the mask’s cultural background, acknowledge its origins if displayed publicly, and support African artists directly.  \n- **When in Doubt**:  \n  Consult resources like UNESCO’s *1970 Convention* guidelines or local cultural heritage authorities.\n\nIn short, **displaying African-style masks is generally legal if they are modern reproductions or decor items**, but ethical responsibility requires mindful sourcing and respect for their cultural significance."}
{"Question": "Q: My question is that I am suffering from inferiority complex. I mean despite having friends, good family, beauty, money and all these, my heart is not satisfied. I only think with myself that I dont have any friend, I get serious on small jokes of my friends, I get too much tension from small things. I think that the people are ignoring me, if two of my friends are going closer and I am a little on distance with them I feel that they dont care of me, whenever I look to the handwriting of my friend my heart says that there writing is better than mine. Simply I would like to say that I have no peace of heart and mind and I always consider myself smaller than others. Please tell me the reason and treatment. ? --T--", "Answer": "Do not pay attention to all these negative feelings. Instead be normal when you conduct with people. Be punctual on your salaah and ensure that you observe purdah from all na mahrams. Commence taleem of fazaail aamaal and fazaail sadaqaat daily. And Allah Taala ( ) knows best", "Document": "Narrated Aisha:(The wife of the Prophet) Whenever Allahs Apostle intended to go on a journey, he used to draw lots among his wives and would take with him the one on whom the lot had fallen. Once he drew lots when he wanted to carry out a Ghazwa, and the lot came upon me. So I proceeded with Allahs Apostle after Allahs order of veiling (the women) had been revealed and thus I was carried in my howdah (on a camel) and dismounted while still in it. We carried on our journey, and when Allahs Apostle had finished his Ghazwa and returned and we approached Medina, Allahs Apostle ordered to proceed at night. When the army was ordered to resume the homeward journey, I got up and walked on till I left the army (camp) behind. When I had answered the call of nature, I went towards my howdah, but behold ! A necklace of mine made of Jaz Azfar (a kind of black bead) was broken and I looked for it and my search for it detained me. The group of people who used to carry me, came and carried my howdah on to the back of my camel on which I was riding, considering that I was therein. At that time women were light in weight and were not fleshy for they used to eat little (food), so those people did not feel the lightness of the howdah while raising it up, and I was still a young lady. They drove away the camel and proceeded. Then I found my necklace after the army had gone. I came to their camp but found nobody therein so I went to the place where I used to stay, thinking that they would miss me and come back in my search. While I was sitting at my place, I felt sleepy and slept. Safwan bin Al-Muattil As-Sulami Adh- Dhakw-ani was behind the army. He had started in the last part of the night and reached my stationing place in the morning and saw the figure of a sleeping person. He came to me and recognized me on seeing me for he used to see me before veiling. I got up because of his saying: \"Inna Li l-lahi wa inna ilaihi rajiun,\" which he uttered on recognizing me. I covered my face with my garment, and by Allah, he did not say to me a single word except, \"Inna Li l-lahi wa inna ilaihi rajiun,\" till he made his shecamel kneel down whereupon he trod on its forelegs and I mounted it. Then Safwan set out, leading the she-camel that was carrying me, till we met the army while they were resting during the hot midday. Then whoever was meant for destruction, fell in destruction, and the leader of the Ifk (forged statement) was `Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul. After this we arrived at Medina and I became ill for one month while the people were spreading the forged statements of the people of the Ifk, and I was not aware of anything thereof. But what aroused my doubt while I was sick, was that I was no longer receiving from Allahs Apostle the same kindness as I used to receive when I fell sick. Allahs Apostle would enter upon me, say a greeting and add, \"How is that (lady)?\" and then depart. That aroused my suspicion but I was not aware of the propagated evil till I recovered from my ailment. I went out with Um Mistah to answer the call of nature towards Al-Manasi, the place where we used to relieve ourselves, and used not to go out for this purpose except from night to night, and that was before we had lavatories close to our houses. And this habit of ours was similar to the habit of the old Arabs (in the deserts or in the tents) concerning the evacuation of the bowels, for we considered it troublesome and harmful to take lavatories in the houses. So I went out with Um Mistah who was the daughter of Abi Ruhm bin `Abd Manaf, and her mother was daughter of Sakhr bin Amir who was the aunt of Abi Bakr As-Siddiq, and her son was Mistah bin Uthatha. When we had finished our affair, Um Mistah and I came back towards my house. Um Mistah stumbled over her robe whereupon she said, \"Let Mistah be ruined ! \" I said to her, \"What a bad word you have said! Do you abuse a man who has taken part in the Battle of Badr? She said, \"O you there! Didnt you hear what he has said?\" I said, \"And what did he say?\" She then told me the statement of the people of the Ifk (forged statement) which added to my ailment. When I returned home, Allahs Apostle came to me, and after greeting, he said, \"How is that (lady)?\" I said, \"Will you allow me to go to my parents?\" At that time I intended to be sure of the news through them. Allahs Apostle allowed me and I went to my parents and asked my mother, \"O my mother! What are the people talking about?\" My mother said, \"O my daughter! Take it easy, for by Allah, there is no charming lady who is loved by her husband who has other wives as well, but that those wives would find fault with her.\" I said, \"Subhan Allah! Did the people really talk about that?\" That night I kept on weeping the whole night till the morning. My tears never stopped, nor did I sleep, and morning broke while I was still weeping, Allahs Apostle called `Ali bin Abi Talib and Usama bin Zaid when the Divine Inspiration delayed, in order to consult them as to the idea of divorcing his wife. Usama bin Zaid told Allahs Apostle of what he knew about the innocence of his wife and of his affection he kept for her. He said, \"O Allahs Apostle! She is your wife, and we do not know anything about her except good.\" But `Ali bin Abi Talib said, \"O Allahs Apostle! Allah does not impose restrictions on you; and there are plenty of women other than her. If you however, ask (her) slave girl, she will tell you the truth.\" `Aisha added: So Allahs Apostle called for Barira and said, \"O Barira! Did you ever see anything which might have aroused your suspicion? (as regards Aisha). Barira said, \"By Allah Who has sent you with the truth, I have never seen anything regarding Aisha which I would blame her for except that she is a girl of immature age who sometimes sleeps and leaves the dough of her family unprotected so that the domestic goats come and eat it.\" So Allahs Apostle got up (and addressed) the people an asked for somebody who would take revenge on `Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul then. Allahs Apostle, while on the pulpit, said, \"O Muslims! Who will help me against a man who has hurt me by slandering my family? By Allah, I know nothing except good about my family, and people have blamed a man of whom I know nothing except good, and he never used to visit my family except with me,\" Sa`d bin Mu`adh Al-Ansari got up and said, \"O Allahs Apostle! By Allah, I will relieve you from him. If he be from the tribe of (Bani) Al-Aus, then I will chop his head off; and if he be from our brethren, the Khazraj, then you give us your order and we will obey it.\" On that, Sa`d bin Ubada got up, and he was the chief of the Khazraj, and before this incident he had been a pious man but he was incited by his zeal for his tribe. He said to Sa`d (bin Mu`adh), \"By Allah the Eternal, you have told a lie! You shall not kill him and you will never be able to kill him!\" On that, Usaid bin Hudair, the cousin of Sa`d (bin Mu`adh) got up and said to Sa`d bin Ubada, \"You are a liar! By Allah the Eternal, we will surely kill him; and you are a hypocrite defending the hypocrites!\" So the two tribes of Al-Aus and Al-Khazraj got excited till they were on the point of fighting with each other while Allahs Apostle was standing on the pulpit. Allahs Apostle continued quietening them till they became silent whereupon he became silent too. On that day I kept on weeping so much that neither did my tears stop, nor could I sleep. In the morning my parents were with me, and I had wept for two nights and a day without sleeping and with incessant tears till they thought that my liver would burst with weeping. While they were with me and I was weeping, an Ansari woman asked permission to see me. I admitted her and she sat and started weeping with me. While I was in that state, Allahs Apostle came to us, greeted, and sat down,. He had never sat with me since the day what was said, was said. He had stayed a month without receiving any Divine Inspiration concerning my case. Allahs Apostle recited the Tashahhud after he had sat down, and then said, \"Thereafter, O `Aisha! I have been informed such and-such a thing about you; and if you are innocent, Allah will reveal your innocence, and if you have committed a sin, then ask for Allahs forgiveness and repent to Him, for when a slave confesses his sin and then repents to Allah, Allah accepts his repentance.\" When Allahs Apostle had finished his speech, my tears ceased completely so that I no longer felt even a drop thereof. Then I said to my father, \"Reply to Allahs Apostle on my behalf as to what he said.\" He said, \"By Allah, I do not know what to say to Allahs Apostle.\" Then I said to my mother, \"Reply to Allahs Apostle.\" She said, \"I do not know what to say to Allahs Apostle.\" Still a young girl as I was and though I had little knowledge of Quran, I said, \"By Allah, I know that you heard this story (of the Ifk) so much so that it has been planted in your minds and you have believed it. So now, if I tell you that I am innocent, and Allah knows that I am innocent, you will not believe me; and if I confess something, and Allah knows that I am innocent of it, you will believe me. By Allah, I cannot find of you an example except that of Josephs father: \"So (for me) patience is most fitting against that which you assert and it is Allah (Alone) Whose help can be sought. Then I turned away and lay on my bed, and at that time I knew that I was innocent and that Allah would reveal my innocence. But by Allah, I never thought that Allah would sent down about my affair, Divine Inspiration that would be recited (forever), as I considered myself too unworthy to be talked of by Allah with something that was to be recited: but I hoped that Allahs Apostle might have a vision in which Allah would prove my innocence. By Allah, Allahs Apostle had not left his seat and nobody had left the house when the Divine Inspiration came to Allahs Apostle . So there overtook him the same hard condition which used to overtake him (when he was Divinely Inspired) so that the drops of his sweat were running down, like pearls, though it was a (cold) winter day, and that was because of the heaviness of the Statement which was revealed to him. When that state of Allahs Apostle was over, and he was smiling when he was relieved, the first word he said was, \"Aisha, Allah has declared your innocence.\" My mother said to me, \"Get up and go to him.\" I said, \"By Allah, I will not go to him and I will not thank anybody but Allah.\" So Allah revealed: \"Verily! They who spread the Slander are a gang among you. Think it not....\" (24.11-20). When Allah revealed this to confirm my innocence, Abu Bakr As-Siddiq who used to provide for Mistah bin Uthatha because of the latters kinship to him and his poverty, said, \"By Allah, I will never provide for Mistah anything after what he has said about Aisha\". So Allah revealed: (continued...) (continuing... 1): -6.274:... ... \"Let not those among you who are good and are wealthy swear not to give (help) to their kinsmen, those in need, and those who have left their homes for Allahs Cause. Let them Pardon and forgive (i.e. do not punish them). Do you not love that should forgive you? Verily Allah is Oft-forgiving. Most Merciful.\" (24.22) Abu Bakr said, \"Yes, by Allah, I wish that Allah should forgive me.\" So he resumed giving Mistah the aid he used to give him before and said, \"By Allah, I will never withold it from him at all.\" Aisha further said: Allahs Apostle also asked Zainab bint Jahsh about my case. He said, \"O Zainab! What have you seen?\" She replied, \"O Allahs Apostle! I protect my hearing and my sight (by refraining from telling lies). I know nothing but good (about Aisha).\" Of all the wives of Allahs Apostle, it was Zainab who aspired to receive from him the same favor as I used to receive, yet, Allah saved her (from telling lies) because of her piety. But her sister, Hamna, kept on fighting on her behalf so she was destroyed as were those who invented and spread the slander.<D>Narrated Aisha:(the wife of the Prophet) \"Whenever Allahs Apostle intended to go on a journey, he would draw lots amongst his wives and would take with him the one upon whom the lot fell. During a Ghazwa of his, he drew lots amongst us and the lot fell upon me, and I proceeded with him after Allah had decreed the use of the veil by women. I was carried in a Howdah (on the camel) and dismounted while still in it. When Allahs Apostle was through with his Ghazwa and returned home, and we approached the city of Medina, Allahs Apostle ordered us to proceed at night. When the order of setting off was given, I walked till I was past the army to answer the call of nature. After finishing I returned (to the camp) to depart (with the others) and suddenly realized that my necklace over my chest was missing. So, I returned to look for it and was delayed because of that. The people who used to carry me on the camel, came to my Howdah and put it on the back of the camel, thinking that I was in it, as, at that time, women were light in weight, and thin and lean, and did not use to eat much. So, those people did not feel the difference in the heaviness of the Howdah while lifting it, and they put it over the camel. At that time I was a young lady. They set the camel moving and proceeded on. I found my necklace after the army had gone, and came to their camp to find nobody. So, I went to the place where I used to stay, thinking that they would discover my absence and come back in my search. While in that state, I felt sleepy and slept. Safwan bin Muattal As-Sulami Adh-Dhakwani was behind the army and reached my abode in the morning. When he saw a sleeping person, he came to me, and he used to see me before veiling. So, I got up when I heard him saying, \"Inna lil-lah-wa inn a ilaihi rajiun (We are for Allah, and we will return to Him).\" He made his camel knell down. He got down from his camel, and put his leg on the front legs of the camel and then I rode and sat over it. Safwan set out walking, leading the camel by the rope till we reached the army who had halted to take rest at midday. Then whoever was meant for destruction, fell into destruction, (some people accused me falsely) and the leader of the false accusers was `Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul. After that we returned to Medina, and I became ill for one month while the people were spreading the forged statements of the false accusers. I was feeling during my ailment as if I were not receiving the usual kindness from the Prophet which I used to receive from him when I got sick. But he would come, greet and say, How is that (girl)? I did not know anything of what was going on till I recovered from my ailment and went out with Um Mistah to the Manasi where we used to answer the call of nature, and we used not to go to answer the call of nature except from night to night and that was before we had lavatories near to our houses. And this habit of ours was similar to the habit of the old Arabs in the open country (or away from houses). So. I and Um Mistah bint Ruhm went out walking. Um Mistah stumbled because of her long dress and on that she said, Let Mistah be ruined. I said, You are saying a bad word. Why are you abusing a man who took part in (the battle of) Badr? She said, O Hanata (you there) didnt you hear what they said? Then she told me the rumors of the false accusers. My sickness was aggravated, and when I returned home, Allahs Apostle came to me, and after greeting he said, How is that (girl)? I requested him to allow me to go to my parents. I wanted then to be sure of the news through them I Allahs Apostle allowed me, and I went to my parents and asked my mother, What are the people talking about? She said, O my daughter! Dont worry much about this matter. By Allah, never is there a charming woman loved by her husband who has other wives, but the women would forge false news about her. I said, Glorified be Allah! Are the people really taking of this matter? That night I kept on weeping and could not sleep till morning. In the morning Allahs Apostle called `Ali bin Abu Talib and Usama bin Zaid when he saw the Divine Inspiration delayed, to consul them about divorcing his wife (i.e. `Aisha). Usama bin Zaid said what he knew of the good reputation of his wives and added, O Allahs Apostle! Keep you wife, for, by Allah, we know nothing about her but good. `Ali bin Abu Talib said, O Allahs Apostle! Allah has no imposed restrictions on you, and there are many women other than she, yet you may ask the woman-servant who will tell you the truth. On that Allahs Apostle called Buraira and said, O Burair. Did you ever see anything which roused your suspicions about her? Buraira said, No, by Allah Who has sent you with the Truth, I have never seen in her anything faulty except that she is a girl of immature age, who sometimes sleeps and leaves the dough for the goats to eat. On that day Allahs Apostle ascended the pulpit and requested that somebody support him in punishing `Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul. Allahs Apostle said, Who will support me to punish that person (`Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul) who has hurt me by slandering the reputation of my family? By Allah, I know nothing about my family but good, and they have accused a person about whom I know nothing except good, and he never entered my house except in my company. Sa`d bin Mu`adh got up and said, O Allahs Apostle! by Allah, I will relieve you from him. If that man is from the tribe of the Aus, then we will chop his head off, and if he is from our brothers, the Khazraj, then order us, and we will fulfill your order. On that Sa`d bin Ubada, the chief of the Khazraj and before this incident, he had been a pious man, got up, motivated by his zeal for his tribe and said, By Allah, you have told a lie; you cannot kill him, and you will never be able to kill him. On that Usaid bin Al-Hadir got up and said (to Sa`d bin Ubada), By Allah! you are a liar. By Allah, we will kill him; and you are a hypocrite, defending the hypocrites. On this the two tribes of Aus and Khazraj got excited and were about to fight each other, while Allahs Apostle was standing on the pulpit. He got down and quieted them till they became silent and he kept quiet. On that day I kept on weeping so much so that neither did my tears stop, nor could I sleep. In the morning my parents were with me and I had wept for two nights and a day, till I thought my liver would burst from weeping. While they were sitting with me and I was weeping, an Ansari woman asked my permission to enter, and I allowed her to come in. She sat down and started weeping with me. While we were in this state, Allahs Apostle came and sat down and he had never sat with me since the day they forged the accusation. No revelation regarding my case came to him for a month. He recited Tashah-hud (i.e. None has the right to be worshipped but Allah and Muhammad is His Apostle) and then said, O `Aisha! I have been informed such-and-such about you; if you are innocent, then Allah will soon reveal your innocence, and if you have committed a sin, then repent to Allah and ask Him to forgive you, for when a person confesses his sin and asks Allah for forgiveness, Allah accepts his repentance. When Allahs Apostle finished his speech my tears ceased completely and there remained not even a single drop of it. I requested my father to reply to Allahs Apostle on my behalf. My father said, By Allah, I do not know what to say to Allahs Apostle. I said to my mother, Talk to Allahs Apostle on my behalf. She said, By Allah, I do not know what to say to Allahs Apostle. I was a young girl and did not have much knowledge of the Quran. I said. I know, by Allah, that you have listened to what people are saying and that has been planted in your minds and you have taken it as a truth. Now, if I told you that I am innocent and Allah knows that I am innocent, you would not believe me and if I confessed to you falsely that I am guilty, and Allah knows that I am innocent you would believe me. By Allah, I dont compare my situation with you except to the situation of Josephs father (i.e. Jacob) who said, So (for me) patience is most fitting against that which you assert and it is Allah (Alone) whose help can be sought. Then I turned to the other side of my bed hoping that Allah would prove my innocence. By Allah I never thought that Allah would reveal Divine Inspiration in my case, as I considered myself too inferior to be talked of in the Holy Quran. I had hoped that Allahs Apostle might have a dream in which Allah would prove my innocence. By Allah, Allahs Apostle had not got up and nobody had left the house before the Divine Inspiration came to Allahs Apostle. So, there overtook him the same state which used to overtake him, (when he used to have, on being inspired divinely). He was sweating so much so that the drops of the sweat were dropping like pearls though it was a (cold) wintry day. When that state of Allahs Apostle was over, he was smiling and the first word he said, `Aisha! Thank Allah, for Allah has declared your innocence. My mother told me to go to Allahs Apostle . I replied, By Allah I will not go to him and will not thank but Allah. So Allah revealed: \"Verily! They who spread the slander are a gang among you . . .\" (24.11) When Allah gave the declaration of my Innocence, Abu Bakr, who used to provide for Mistah bin Uthatha for he was his relative, said, By Allah, I will never provide Mistah with anything because of what he said about Aisha. But Allah later revealed: -- \"And let not those who are good and wealthy among you swear not to help their kinsmen, those in need and those who left their homes in Allahs Cause. Let them forgive and overlook. Do you not wish that Allah should forgive you? Verily! Allah is Oft-forgiving, Most Merciful.\" (24.22) After that Abu Bakr said, Yes ! By Allah! I like that Allah should forgive me, and resumed helping Mistah whom he used to help before. Allahs Apostle also asked Zainab bint Jahsh (i.e. the Prophets wife about me saying, What do you know and what did you see? She replied, O Allahs Apostle! I refrain to claim hearing or seeing what I have not heard or seen. By Allah, I know nothing except goodness about Aisha.\" Aisha further added \"Zainab was competing with me (in her beauty and the Prophets love), yet Allah protected her (from being malicious), for she had piety.\"<D>Sufyan narrated from Amr bin Dinar that he heard Jabir bin Abdullah sayin:“We were in a battle” – Sufyan said: “They say in was the battle of Banu Mustaliq” – “Aman from the Muhajirin kicked a man from the Ansar. The man from the Muhajirin said: ‘O Muhajirin!’ the man from the Ansar said: ‘O Ansar!’ The Prophet heard that and said: ‘What is this evil call of Jahliyyah?’ They said: ‘A man from the Muhajirin kicked a man from the Ansar.’ So the Prophet said: ‘Leave that, for it is offensive.’ Abdullah bin Ubayy bin Salul heard that and said: ‘Did they really do that? By Allah! If we return to Al-Madinah indeed the more honorable will expel therefrom the meaner.’ Umar said: ‘Allow me to chop off the head of this hypocrite O Messenger of Allah!’ The Prophet said: ‘Leave him, I do not want the people to say that Muhammad kills his Companios.’” Someone other than Amr said: “So his son, Abdullah bin Abdullah, said: ‘By Allah! You shall not return until you say that you are the mean and that the Messenger of Allah is the honorable.’ So he did so.”<D>(Allah hath decreed: Lo! I verily shall conquer, I and My messengers) i.e. Muhammad (pbuh) they shall conquer Persia, Byzantium, the hypocrites and the Jews. (Lo! Allah is Strong) through giving help to his prophets, (Almighty) in retribution against His enemies. This was revealed about Abdullah Ibn Ubayy Ibn Salul who said to the true believers: Do you really think that you shall conquer Persia and Byzantium?.<D>(Thinketh he) does the disbelieving man think (that) because of his strength and force (none hath power over him?) i.e. Allah cannot seize and punish him.<D>(What then is your opinion of the Lord of the Worlds) what do you think He will do to you if you worship other than Him?", "Generated_Answer": "I deeply empathize with your struggle—it takes courage to acknowledge these feelings. What you're describing is a profound disconnect between your external circumstances (which seem objectively positive) and your internal experience of self-worth. Let's explore the roots of this pattern and practical steps toward healing:\n\n### **Possible Roots:**\n1. **Core Beliefs:** Even with external validation, childhood experiences (e.g., criticism, conditional praise, bullying) can embed beliefs like \"I'm not enough\" or \"I must earn love.\" These operate subconsciously.\n2. **Comparison Trap:** Social media and cultural messaging often tie worth to achievement, appearance, or others' approval. Your focus on handwriting or friends' closeness suggests this habit is automatic.\n3. **Anxiety & Hypervigilance:** Your mind may scan for \"proof\" of rejection (e.g., friends talking privately) to confirm negative beliefs—a self-fulfilling cycle.\n4. **Perfectionism:** Holding yourself to impossible standards (\"My writing must be perfect\") fuels self-criticism when reality falls short.\n\n### **Practical Steps Toward Healing:**\n1. **Challenge Distortions with Evidence:**  \n   - When you think, \"They don’t care about me,\" write:  \n     *Fact:* \"My friends invited me out yesterday.\"  \n     *Fear:* \"But they were whispering—they like each other more.\"  \n     *Alternative:* \"Friends can have private jokes and still value me.\"\n   - Over time, this rewires knee-jerk negativity.\n\n2. **Shift Focus from Comparison to Connection:**  \n   - When comparing yourself (e.g., handwriting), pause and ask:  \n     *\"Does this actually matter to our friendship?\"*  \n     Redirect attention to shared laughter or support.\n\n3. **Practice Self-Compassion:**  \n   - Speak to yourself as you would a hurting friend:  \n     *\"This feels painful, but it's okay. I’m human, and my worth isn’t defined by this moment.\"*  \n   - Try a daily affirmation: *\"I am enough, exactly as I am.\"*\n\n4. **Set Boundaries with Rumination:**  \n   - Designate 10 minutes daily to journal worries. When anxiety arises outside this time, say: *\"I’ll address this later.\"* This contains spiraling.\n\n5. **Reclaim Your Narrative:**  \n   - List 3 things you appreciate about yourself unrelated to others (e.g., \"I’m thoughtful,\" \"I love how I laugh freely\"). Read them aloud daily.\n\n6. **Seek Professional Support:**  \n   - Therapy (CBT or ACT) can uncover core wounds and provide tools. If unavailable, explore workbooks like *\"Self-Esteem\" by Matthew McKay*.\n\n### **A Note on Validation:**\nYour feelings are real, but they’re not facts. The pain you feel is your mind trying to protect you from perceived threats—but it’s overzealous. Healing begins when you observe these thoughts without letting them define you.\n\n### **Final Thought:**  \nTrue worth isn’t earned; it’s inherent. You’re not \"smaller\"—you’re simply human, navigating a world that often mistakes visibility for value. Every step you take to question these patterns is a triumph. Be patient; this didn’t develop overnight, and healing won’t either—but it *will* come.\n\nYou’re not alone in this. Many walk this path, and peace is possible. 🌱"}

It goes back to the issue of whether you can validly wipe with the water left on the hands after washing a limb.Many Hanafi scholars held that it is valid to wipe a limb (such as the head) after the water left over from washing another (such as the arms). The sounder opinion, though, as mentioned by Ibn Abidin, is that this is not valid. It is also what caution would indicate. As such, you dont have to make up any prayers performed on such wudus. However, dont do it again", "Document": "Narrated `Abdullah:Allahs Apostle said, \"I saw (in a dream) the people assembled in a gathering, and then Abu Bakr got up and drew one or two buckets of water (from a well) but there was weakness in his drawing. May Allah forgive him. Then `Umar took the bucket and in his hands it turned into a very large bucket. I had never seen anyone amongst: the people who could draw the water as strongly as `Umar till all the people drank their fill and watered their camels that knelt down there.<D>Narrated Abdullah ibn az-Zubayr:A man disputed with az-Zubayr about streamlets in the lava plain which was irrigated by them. The Ansari said: Release the water and let it run, but az-Zubayr refused. The Holy Prophet () said to az-Zubayr: Water (your ground), Zubayr, then let the water run to your neighbour. The Ansari then became angry and said: Messenger of Allah! it is because he is your cousin! Thereupon the face of the Messenger of Allah () changed colour and he said: Water (your ground), then keep back the water till it returns to the embankment. Az-Zubayr said: By Allah! I think this verse came down about that: \"But no , by thy Lord! they can have no (real) faith, until they make thee judge.....\"<D>It was narrated that Talq bin Ali said:\"We went out as a delegation to the Prophet (); we gave him our oath of allegiance and prayed with him. We told him that in our land there was a church that belonged to us. We asked him to give us the leftovers of his purification (Wudu water).

Based on the Hanafi school of thought, which you follow, here is the clarification you requested:\n\n---\n\n### **1. Wiping the Head (Masah) with Residual Water is Valid**\nIn the Hanafi madhhab, it is **perfectly permissible** to wipe your head using the **residual moisture (رطوبة باقية)** left on your hands after washing your arms (from elbows to fingertips). You do **not** need to collect fresh water specifically for wiping your head, nor is it required to rewet your hands under the faucet before performing masah.\n\nThis is explicitly stated in classical Hanafi texts:\n- Imam al-Haskafi (رحمه الله) writes in *Durr al-Mukhtar*:  \n  *\"It is sufficient to wipe the head with the moisture remaining on the hands after washing the arms.\"*  \n- This is affirmed in *Radd al-Muhtar* and other reliable Hanafi references.\n\n---\n\n### **2. The Ruling on \"Fresh Water\"**\nYour understanding that \"at least one hand should have fresh water from running the faucet\" is **not a requirement** in the Hanafi school. The moisture already on your hands after washing your arms is sufficient for masah, even if no additional water is applied. \n\n---\n\n### **3. The Shaykh’s Guidance is Correct**\nThe Hanifi Shaykh you consulted is absolutely right. As long as:  \n- You washed your arms properly (from elbows to fingertips),  \n- There is still moisture on your palms/fingers when you wipe your head (even minimally),  \n- You wiped at least one-quarter of your head with your wet hands,  \n\n**Your wudu is valid** by Hanafi standards, insha'Allah.\n\n---\n\n### **4. Practical Advice for Ease**\nIf you are still concerned or wish to satisfy your heart, you may:  \n- Briefly rinse your hands again under running water **before** wiping your head, though this is **not obligatory**.  \n- Ensure your hands are not completely dry when performing masah (a small amount of moisture suffices).  \n\n---\n\n### **5. Key Points to Remember**\n- The Hanafi position emphasizes practicality and avoids unnecessary hardship.  \n- **Doubts (waswasa)** about the validity of wudu are common, but you should not let them overwhelm you. Once you follow the correct steps, trust that Allah accepts your effort.  \n- If you remain uneasy, renew your intention for wudu and seek Allah’s help against whispers (Quran 114:1–6).\n\n---\n\n### Conclusion\nYour wudu is valid based on what you described, and the Shaykh’s guidance aligns with the Hanafi school. Continue performing wudu as you have been, and may Allah grant you peace of mind and acceptance in your worship.\n\nWa assalamu alaikum wa rahmatullah."}

Here’s a concise overview of the Islamic view:\n\n---\n\n### **1. Qur’anic Prohibition**\n- **Direct Prohibition**: Alcohol (along with gambling and other intoxicants) is explicitly forbidden in the Qur’an:  \n  > ***\"O you who believe! Intoxicants, gambling, idolatrous practices, and divining arrows are abominations of Satan’s handiwork. So shun them so that you may prosper.\"*** (Qur’an 5:90)  \n  This verse categorizes alcohol as a \"sin\" and a tool of Satan, harmful to both spiritual and worldly well-being.  \n- **Gradual Revelation**: Earlier verses (e.g., 2:219, 4:43) acknowledged alcohol’s harms but did not outright ban it, reflecting a phased approach to wean society away from its widespread use in pre-Islamic Arabia.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Teachings of the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH)**\n- The Hadith (sayings of the Prophet) reinforce the ban:  \n  - ***\"Every intoxicant is alcohol, and every intoxicant is forbidden.\"*** (Sahih Muslim)  \n  - The Prophet cursed not only those who consume alcohol but also those involved in its production, distribution, or serving (Sunan Ibn Majah).  \n- **Zero Tolerance**: Even small quantities are prohibited if they cause intoxication, based on the principle: ***\"What intoxicates in large amounts is forbidden in small amounts.\"***  \n\n---\n\n### **3. Scholarly Consensus (Ijmaʿ)**\n- All major Islamic schools of thought (Sunni and Shia) unanimously agree that consuming alcohol or any intoxicating substance is **haram** (forbidden). This extends to substances with similar effects (e.g., drugs, narcotics).  \n\n---\n\n### **4. Rationale Behind the Prohibition**\n- **Spiritual Harm**: Intoxication clouds judgment, distracts from worship (e.g., prayer), and weakens moral discipline.  \n- **Social and Physical Harm**: Islam emphasizes preserving life, intellect, family, and societal order. Alcohol is linked to health issues, addiction, violence, broken families, and accidents.  \n- **Holistic Well-Being**: The prohibition reflects Islam’s focus on protecting the *mind* (ʿaql), one of the five essential human rights in Islamic law (life, faith, lineage, intellect, property).\n\n---\n\n### **5. Modern Applications & Debates**\n- **Non-Alcoholic Alternatives**: Beverages labeled \"non-alcoholic\" (e.g., 0% beer) are permissible **only if they contain no intoxicating traces** and are not imitations of forbidden drinks.  \n- **Medicinal/Industrial Use**: Scholars permit external or industrial uses of alcohol (e.g., disinfectants, perfumes) as long as it isn’t consumed. Internal medical use is debated but generally discouraged unless no alternative exists.  \n- **Cultural Challenges**: In some Muslim-majority societies, alcohol is legally available (often due to colonial legacies or tourism), but devout Muslims still abstain. Conversely, countries like Saudi Arabia enforce strict bans.  \n\n---\n\n### **6. A Spiritual Perspective**\nFor Muslims, avoiding alcohol is an act of obedience to God and a means of attaining *taqwa* (God-consciousness). It symbolizes self-control, purity, and commitment to community welfare. As the Qur’an states:  \n> ***\"Satan only wants to stir up hostility and hatred among you through intoxicants and gambling and to prevent you from remembering Allah and praying. Will you not then abstain?\"*** (5:91)\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nIslam’s stance on alcohol is unambiguous: it is prohibited for consumption in all forms. While cultural practices and individual adherence may vary, the religious ruling remains a cornerstone of Islamic ethics, aiming to safeguard human dignity and societal harmony.  \n\nIf you have further questions about specific scenarios or scholarly opinions, feel free to ask!"}

If a substance (e.g., scabs, dirt, or any barrier) prevents water from contacting the skin, it must be removed before purification. Here’s a step-by-step guide based on your situation:\n\n---\n\n### **1. Assess the Dots:**\n   - **If they were scabs or barriers:**  \n     - If the dots were **scabs, dried blood, or any removable substance** that formed a barrier, and they were present **during ghusl/wudoo**, water may not have reached the skin beneath them. In this case, the affected area must be washed again after removing the barrier.\n     - If you **scratched one dot after ghusl/wudoo** and it became smooth, you should:\n       - Remove any remaining barrier (if applicable).\n       - Rewash **only that specific area** (behind the ear) by allowing water to flow over it.\n     - For the **remaining dot**, check if it is a barrier. If it is removable (e.g., a scab), gently remove it and rewash the area. If it is a natural part of the skin (e.g., a mole or pimple), no action is needed.\n\n   - **If they were part of the skin:**  \n     If the dots were skin irregularities (e.g., moles, pimples, or bumps) **not preventing water from reaching the skin**, they do not affect your taharah (purification). No further action is required.\n\n---\n\n### **2. General Principles to Follow:**\n   - **Doubt after Completion:**  \n     If you only realized the issue **after completing ghusl/wudoo**, and you are uncertain whether water reached the skin during the initial washing, you do **not** need to repeat the entire ghusl or wudoo. Simply wash the affected area properly now.\n   - **Size of the Barrier:**  \n     If the barrier was very small (e.g., the size of a fingertip or smaller), most scholars consider it excused, and your ghusl remains valid.\n   - **Avoid Waswas (Unnecessary Doubt):**  \n     If you are prone to excessive doubt (waswas), trust that your initial ghusl/wudoo was valid unless you are **certain** water did not reach the skin. Islam emphasizes ease and does not burden believers with uncertainty.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Practical Steps:**\n   - **For the scratched dot:**  \n     Rewash the area behind the ear where the dot was located by pouring water over it. No need to repeat the entire ghusl or wudoo.\n   - **For the remaining dot:**  \n     If it is a removable barrier, remove it gently and rewash the area. If it is not a barrier, leave it.\n   - **If in doubt about the entire ghusl:**  \n     To attain peace of mind, perform ghusl again, ensuring all barriers are removed and water reaches every part of the body.\n\n---\n\n### **Key Ruling:**\nYour ghusl and wudoo are **valid** unless you are **certain** that a barrier prevented water from reaching the skin. If the dots were scabs or similar barriers, rewash the affected areas only. If they were part of the skin, no action is needed.\n\nMay Allah accept your worship and grant you ease."}

Here’s a compassionate, actionable guide:\n\n### 1. **Challenge Negative Self-Talk**\n   - **Identify patterns**: Notice when you criticize yourself (e.g., \"I’m useless,\" \"Everyone is better than me\"). Write these thoughts down.\n   - **Question the evidence**: Ask, *\"Is this thought based on facts or feelings?\"* Replace it with balanced statements (e.g., \"I made a mistake, but I’m learning\").\n   - **Practice self-compassion**: Treat yourself as you would a friend. Use kind affirmations like, \"I am enough, just as I am.\"\n\n### 2. **Focus on Small Wins**\n   - Set tiny, achievable goals (e.g., a 10-minute walk, cooking a meal, sending one email). Celebrate completing them—this rewires your brain to recognize your capabilities.\n   - Keep a \"success journal\" to track progress and reflect on strengths.\n\n### 3. **Limit Comparisons (Especially Online)**\n   - Social media often showcases curated \"highlight reels.\" Remind yourself: *Comparison steals joy*. Unfollow accounts that trigger insecurity.\n   - Redirect energy inward: Ask, *\"What do I value? What makes me unique?\"* instead of measuring against others.\n\n### 4. **Build a Support System**\n   - **Connect authentically**: Share your feelings with trusted friends/family. Vulnerability often strengthens relationships.\n   - **Seek community**: Join groups (in-person or online) centered on hobbies, support, or personal growth. You’re not alone.\n\n### 5. **Prioritize Self-Care**\n   - **Body-mind connection**: Exercise, sleep, and nutrition impact mood. Even light movement (like stretching) releases mood-boosting endorphins.\n   - **Mindfulness**: Try 5-minute breathing exercises or apps like Insight Timer. This reduces overthinking and grounds you in the present.\n\n### 6. **Redefine \"Failure\"**\n   - Mistakes are part of growth, not proof of inadequacy. Ask, *\"What can I learn here?\"* instead of *\"Why am I such a failure?\"*\n   - Embrace imperfection—perfectionism fuels self-doubt.\n\n### 7. **Seek Professional Help**\n   - Therapy (e.g., CBT, ACT) provides tools to reframe thoughts and heal deeper wounds. A therapist offers unbiased guidance.\n   - If cost is a barrier, explore low-cost clinics, online platforms (BetterHelp), or workbooks like *Self-Esteem* by Matthew McKay.\n\n### 8. **Practice \"Power Posing\"**\n   - Stand tall, shoulders back, for 2 minutes daily. Research shows confident body language can temporarily boost self-assurance.\n\n### 9. **Serve Others**\n   - Volunteering or helping a neighbor shifts focus outward, fostering purpose and connection—key antidotes to inferiority.\n\n### 10. **Be Patient**\n   - Healing isn’t linear. Some days will feel harder. Acknowledge progress, no matter how small. *You are worthy of kindness, including your own.*\n\n### When to Seek Immediate Help:\nIf low self-esteem leads to hopelessness, isolation, or thoughts of self-harm, reach out to a mental health professional or a crisis hotline (e.g., 988 in the U.S.) immediately. You matter.\n\n**Remember**: Your worth isn’t defined by achievements, others’ opinions, or past struggles. You are inherently valuable—simply because you exist. 🌱  \n*\"You yourself, as much as anybody in the entire universe, deserve your love and affection.\"* —Buddha."}

I heard Ubayy b. Kab say: Moses (peace be upon him) stood up to give sermon to the people of Israil. He was asked as to who amongst the people has the best knowledge, whereupon he said: I have the best knowledge. Thereupon Allah was annoyed with him that he did not attribute (the best knowledge) to Him. He revealed to him: A servant amongst My servants is at the junction of two rivers who has more knowledge than yours. Moses said: How can I meet him? It was said to him: Carry a fish in the large basket and the place where you find it missing there you will find him. Thereupon Moses proceeded forth along with a young man (Yusha). Joshua b. Nan and Moses (peace be upon him) put the fish in the basket and there went along with him the young man (Yusha) until they came to a certain rock and Moses and his companion went to sleep and the fish stirred in that basket and fell into the ocean and Allah stopped the current of water like a vault until the way was made for the fish. Moses and his youn. companion were astonished and they walked for the rest of the day and the night and the friend of Moses forgot to inform him of this incident. When it was morning, Moses (peace be upon him) said to the young man: Bring for us the breakfast for we are dead tired because of this journey, and they did not feel exhausted until they had passed that place where they had been commanded (to stay). He said: Dont you know that when we reached the Sakhra (rock) I forgot the fisii and noth ng made me forget it but the satan that I. could nit remember it? How strange is it that the fish found a way in the river? Moses said: That was what we had been aiming at. Then both of them retraced their steps until they reached Sakhra; there they saw a man covered with a cloth. Moses greeted him. Khadir said to him: Where is as-Salam in our country.? He said: I am Moses, whereupon he (Khadir) said: You mean the Moses of Bani Israil? He said: Yes. He (Khadir) said: You have a knowledge out of the knowledge of Allah which in fact Allah imparted to you and about that I know nothing and I have knowledge out of Allahs knowledge which He imparted to me and about that you do not know. Moses (peace be upon him) said to him: May I follow you so that you may teach me that with which you have been taught righteousness. He said: You will not be able to bear with me; how you will be able to bear that about which you do not know? Moses said: Thou wilt find me patient, nor shalt I disobey you in aught. Khadir said to him: If you were to follow me, then do not ask me about anything until I myself speak to you about it. He said: Yes. So Khadir and Moses set forth on the bank of the river that there came before them a boat. Both of theni talked to them (the owners of the boat) so that they might carry both of them. They had recognised Khadir and they carried them free. Khadir thereupon took hold of a plank in the boat and broke it away. Moses said: These people have carried us without any charge and you attempt to break their boat so that the people sailing in the boat may drown. This is (something) grievous that you have done. He said: Did I not say that you would not bear with me? He said: Blame me not for what I forgot and be not hard upon what I did. Then both of them got down from the boat and began to walk along the coastline that they saw a boy who had been playing with other boys. Khadir pulled up his head and killed him. Moses said: Have you killed an innocent person who is in no way guilty of slaying another? You have done something horrible. Thereupon he said: Did I not say to you that you will not be able to bear with me? He (Moses) said: This (act) is more grievous than the first one. He (Moses) further said. If I ask you about anything after this, keep not company with me, then you would no doubt find (a plausible) excuse for this. Then they both walked on until they reached the inhabitants of a village. They asked its inhabitants for food but they refused to entertain them as their guests. They found in it a wall which had been bent on one side and was about to fall. Khadir set it right with his own hand. Moses, said to him: It is the people to whom we came but they showed us no hospitality and they did not serve us food. If you wish you can get wages for it. He (Khadir) said: This is the parting of ways between mt and you. Now I wish to reveal to you the significance of that for which you could not bear with me. Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) said. May Allah have mercy upon Moses! I wish if Moses could show patience and a (fuller) story of both of them could have been told. Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) said that the first thing which Moses said was out of forgetfulness. Then there came a sparrow until it perched on the wall of the boat and took water from the ocean. Thereupon, Khadir said: My knowledge and your knowledge in comparison with the knowledge of Allah is even less than the water taken by the sparrow in its beak in comparison to the water of the ocean, and Said b. jubair used to recite (verses 79 and 80 of Sura Kahf) in this way: There was before them a king who used to seize every boat by force which was in order, the boy was an unbeliever.<D>It was narrated that Mughirah bin Shubah said:\"The Prophet went out to relieve himself and when he came back, I met him with a water skin and poured water for him.

(Will they not then see) do they notknow it is from Allah?<D>(On honoured leaves) He says: the Quran is written on scrolls made of skin which are honoured in the sight of Allah", "Generated_Answer": "A: **Guidance on Acting in a State of Uncertainty (Wudoo and Dead Skin)**  \n\nIn Islamic jurisprudence, the general principle when faced with uncertainty in acts of worship is: **\"Certainty is not overruled by doubt\"** (*al-yaqīn lā yazūlu bi’l-shakk*). This means that if you are unsure whether a condition (e.g., water reaching the skin in Wudoo) has been fulfilled, you should **act based on what you are certain of or what is most probable**, unless there is clear evidence to the contrary.  \n\n### Specific Case of Dead Skin in Wudoo:\n1. **Dead Skin and Permeability**:  \n   - Dead skin that is **loose or flaky** but still attached to the body is generally **not considered a barrier (ḥāʾil)** to water in Wudoo, as long as water can reach the underlying skin. If it peels off easily, scholars recommend removing it to ensure water reaches the skin.  \n   - If the dead skin is **thin and water can permeate through it** (e.g., dry patches), the Wudoo remains valid.  \n   - If the dead skin forms a **thick, impermeable layer** (e.g., calluses or hardened skin that prevents water from reaching the skin beneath), it must be removed for Wudoo to be valid.  \n\n2. **Your Current Situation**:  \n   - Since you are uncertain whether water reached your skin due to dead skin, **assume your Wudoo is valid** unless you have clear evidence that water was entirely blocked.  \n   - Proceed with your prayer based on this assumption. Do not invalidate your worship due to mere doubt.  \n\n### General Rule for Uncertainty in Acts of Worship:\n- **Continue as usual**: If you are unsure about a ruling while waiting for an answer, act according to the most reasonable assumption or the default position (*al-aṣl*). In Wudoo, the default is that water has reached the skin unless proven otherwise.  \n- **Avoid excessive doubt (waswasa)**: Islam discourages overcomplicating acts of worship. The Prophet (peace be upon him) said: *\"Leave what makes you doubtful for what does not make you doubtful\"* (Tirmidhi). However, this applies to **clear doubts**, not hypothetical ones.  \n- **Seek knowledge afterward**: Once you receive a definitive answer, adjust your practice accordingly.  \n\n### Practical Steps:\n1. **For future Wudoo**: Gently exfoliate or rinse areas with dead skin to ensure water reaches the skin (without causing harm).  \n2. **If in doubt during Wudoo**: Rewash the limb lightly while focusing on ensuring water contact.  \n3. **Prayer validity**: Your past prayers are **not invalidated** retroactively due to this uncertainty.  \n\n### Scholarly References:\n- The Hanafi school emphasizes that minor barriers (like thin dead skin) do not invalidate Wudoo if water can seep through.  \n- Scholars like Ibn ʿUthaymīn (rahimahullāh) state: *\"If a person has dead skin and does not know whether water penetrates it or not, they should act according to what is most probable. If unsure, they should wash the area again to attain certainty.\"*  \n\n**Conclusion**: Proceed with your prayer now, assuming your Wudoo is valid. After receiving clarity, follow the correct ruling moving forward. May Allah reward your diligence in seeking knowledge and your commitment to proper worship!  \n\nIf you need further details or specific scholarly opinions, feel free to ask."}

Let him create an atom or a grain of wheat or that of barley. This hadith has been transmitted on the authority of Abu Zura and he said: Abu Huraira went to the house of Sald or Marwan which they had built in Medina and he (Abu Huraira) saw a painter who had been painting pictures in his house, whereupon he told that Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) had said like this, but he made no mention of the words:\" Let him create the grain of barley.\"<D>Narrated Samura bin Jundab:Whenever the Prophet finished the (morning) prayer, he would face us and ask, \"Who amongst you had a dream last night?\" So if anyone had seen a dream he would narrate it. The Prophet would say: \"Ma shaa-llah\" (An Arabic maxim meaning literally, What Allah wished, and it indicates a good omen.) One day, he asked us whether anyone of us had seen a dream. We replied in the negative. The Prophet said, \"But I had seen (a dream) last night that two men came to me, caught hold of my hands, and took me to the Sacred Land (Jerusalem). There, I saw a person sitting and another standing with an iron hook in his hand pushing it inside the mouth of the former till it reached the jawbone, and then tore off one side of his cheek, and then did the same with the other side; in the meantime the first side of his cheek became normal again and then he repeated the same operation again. I said, What is this? They told me to proceed on and we went on till we came to a man Lying flat on his back, and another man standing at his head carrying a stone or a piece of rock, and crushing the head of the Lying man, with that stone. Whenever he struck him, the stone rolled away. The man went to pick it up and by the time he returned to him, the crushed head had returned to its normal state and the man came back and struck him again (and so on). I said, Who is this? They told me to proceed on; so we proceeded on and passed by a hole like an oven; with a narrow top and wide bottom, and the fire was kindling underneath that hole. Whenever the fire-flame went up, the people were lifted up to such an extent that they about to get out of it, and whenever the fire got quieter, the people went down into it, and there were naked men and women in it. I said, Who is this? They told me to proceed on. So we proceeded on till we reached a river of blood and a man was in it, and another man was standing at its bank with stones in front of him, facing the man standing in the river. Whenever the man in the river wanted to come out, the other one threw a stone in his mouth and caused him to retreat to his original position; and so whenever he wanted to come out the other would throw a stone in his mouth, and he would retreat to his original position. I asked, What is this? They told me to proceed on and we did so till we reached a well-flourished green garden having a huge tree and near its root was sitting an old man with some children. (I saw) Another man near the tree with fire in front of him and he was kindling it up. Then they (i.e. my two companions) made me climb up the tree and made me enter a house, better than which I have ever seen. In it were some old men and young men, women and children. Then they took me out of this house and made me climb up the tree and made me enter another house that was better and superior (to the first) containing old and young people. I said to them (i.e. my two companions), You have made me ramble all the night. Tell me all about that I have seen. They said, Yes. As for the one whose cheek you saw being torn away, he was a liar and he used to tell lies, and the people would report those lies on his authority till they spread all over the world. So, he will be punished like that till the Day of Resurrection. The one whose head you saw being crushed is the one whom Allah had given the knowledge of Quran (i.e. knowing it by heart) but he used to sleep at night (i.e. he did not recite it then) and did not use to act upon it (i.e. upon its orders etc.) by day; and so this punishment will go on till the Day of Resurrection. And those you saw in the hole (like oven) were adulterers (those men and women who commit illegal sexual intercourse). And those you saw in the river of blood were those dealing in Riba (usury). And the old man who was sitting at the base of the tree was Abraham and the little children around him were the offspring of the people. And the one who was kindling the fire was Malik, the gatekeeper of the Hell-fire. And the first house in which you have gone was the house of the common believers, and the second house was of the martyrs. I am Gabriel and this is Michael. Raise your head. I raised my head and saw a thing like a cloud over me. They said, That is your place. I said, Let me enter my place. They said, You still have some life which you have not yet completed, and when you complete (that remaining portion of your life) you will then enter your place. \"<D>Narrated AbuHurayrah:The Messenger of Allah () said: Gabriel () came to me and said: I came to you last night and was prevented from entering simply because there were images at the door, for there was a decorated curtain with images on it in the house, and there was a dog in the house.

The spiritual legacy of previous occupants does not inherently render a space \"haram\" or invalidate your acts of worship. Here’s a detailed response:\n\n---\n\n### **Islamic Perspective**\n1. **Physical vs. Moral Purity**:  \n   - Islam distinguishes between physical impurities (e.g., filth, bodily fluids) and past immoral actions. The house itself is not sinful; it is merely a physical space. If the house is cleaned and purified according to Islamic guidelines (e.g., removing any visible impurities), it becomes permissible to use it for prayer and dwelling.  \n   - Allah says in the Quran:  \n     > *\"Indeed, Allah loves those who are constantly repentant and loves those who purify themselves.\"* (Quran 2:222).  \n     The focus is on your current state of purity, not the past use of the space.\n\n2. **Intentions and Renewing the Space**:  \n   - Your intention to establish a righteous home and perform acts of worship (e.g., prayer, Quran recitation) transforms the space. The Prophet Muhammad ﷺ purified the Kaaba in Mecca from idolatry and made it a house of monotheistic worship. Similarly, you can spiritually \"reclaim\" the house through good deeds and devotion.  \n   - The Prophet ﷺ said:  \n     > *\"The earth has been made for me a place of prayer and a means of purification.\"* (Sahih al-Bukhari).  \n     This emphasizes that any clean place can be used for worship.\n\n3. **Addressing Spiritual Concerns**:  \n   - If you feel uneasy due to the house’s history, you may:  \n     - Recite the Adhan (call to prayer) upon moving in to dispel negative influences.  \n     - Recite Surah Al-Baqarah regularly, as the Prophet ﷺ stated that Satan flees from a house where it is recited (Sahih Muslim).  \n     - Make dua for Allah’s protection and blessings (e.g., *\"Bismillah, Allahumma inni as-aluka khayraha wa a'udhu bika min sharriha\"*).  \n\n4. **Scholarly Views**:  \n   - Scholars like Ibn Baz (rahimahullah) and others affirm that past sins in a location do not affect its permissibility for new occupants, provided it is cleansed physically and spiritually renewed through worship.  \n   - If the house is associated with ongoing illegal activities (e.g., prostitution rings operating nearby), it may be wise to avoid it for safety and moral reasons (Quran 4:29).\n\n---\n\n### **Practical Steps**\n1. **Clean the house thoroughly**, ensuring no physical impurities remain.  \n2. **Establish regular prayers and Quran recitation** to fill the space with remembrance of Allah.  \n3. **Seek community support** (e.g., inviting righteous friends for gatherings or Islamic study circles) to reinforce positivity.  \n4. **Consult a trusted local scholar** if doubts persist, as they can provide context-specific guidance.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nYes, it is permissible to rent the house, pray in it, and transform it into a place of goodness. Islam encourages optimism and trust in Allah’s mercy—your sincere worship and intentions will elevate the space. As the Quran reminds us:  \n> *\"And whoever fears Allah—He will make for him a way out and provide for"}

Here’s a structured answer based on Quranic and Sunnah guidance:\n\n---\n\n### **1. Definition of Extravagance (*Isrāf*) in Islam**\nExtravagance is condemned in the Quran:  \n**\"Indeed, the wasteful are brothers of the devils, and ever has Satan been to his Lord ungrateful\"** (Quran 17:26–27).  \nIt refers to spending beyond reasonable limits, especially on unnecessary luxuries while neglecting obligations (e.g., family needs, debts, zakāh, charity). The Prophet ﷺ warned: **\"Eat, drink, give charity, and wear clothes without extravagance or arrogance\"** (Sunan Ibn Mājah).\n\n---\n\n### **2. Factors to Consider**\n#### **a) Financial Capacity**  \n- If a person has **excess wealth** after fulfilling all obligations (needs of dependents, zakāh, debts, savings for emergencies), spending on permissible luxuries *in moderation* is allowed.  \n- If the purchase compromises basic needs or obligations, it becomes impermissible extravagance.\n\n#### **b) Purpose and Intention**  \n- Using fragrance is **Sunnah** and encouraged (e.g., for prayers, gatherings). The Prophet ﷺ said: **\"Whoever is offered fragrance, let him not refuse it, for it is light to carry and pleasant in scent\"** (Ṣaḥīḥ Muslim).  \n- However, if the intention is pride (*takabbur*), showing off (*riyāʾ*), or competing in materialism, it becomes sinful.\n\n#### **c) Proportionality**  \n- The **cost relative to income** matters. A R10,000 bottle may be reasonable for a wealthy person but wasteful for someone of modest means.  \n- Evaluate whether cheaper alternatives achieve the same purpose. The Prophet ﷺ preferred simplicity and discouraged excess, even in acts of worship (e.g., limiting water for wuḍūʾ).\n\n#### **d) Social Context**  \n- In some cultures, oudh is a valued luxury tied to hospitality or tradition. Islam allows cultural practices unless they violate Sharīʿah principles.  \n- However, if society suffers from poverty, redirecting wealth to charity (**ṣadaqah**) or communal needs may be more virtuous (Quran 2:219).\n\n---\n\n### **3. Scholarly Views**  \nScholars generally caution against excessive spending on non-essentials:  \n- **Ibn ʿUthaymīn (رحمه الله)** stated that buying expensive items becomes *isrāf* if it exceeds customary norms (*ʿurf*) without justification.  \n- **Mufti Taqi Usmani** advises: \"If a person spends on luxuries while ignoring obligatory rights [e.g., zakāh], it is sinful extravagance.\"\n\n---\n\n### **4. Practical Guidance**  \n- **Prioritize obligations**: Ensure zakāh, family needs, and debts are settled first.  \n- **Moderation**: If oudh is affordable and used moderately (not habitually), it may be permissible.  \n- **Avoid waste**: Small bottles costing R10,000+ may be excessive unless they last years or serve a special purpose (e.g., gifts).  \n- **Intention check**: Ask yourself: \"Am I buying this for Allah’s pleasure (e.g., following the Sunnah of fragrance) or worldly vanity?\"\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**  \nSpending large sums on oudh/attars is **not inherently harām** if:  \n- It does not neglect financial duties,  \n- It aligns with your means,  \n- The intention is pure (not pride/showing off),  \n- And it is done in moderation.  \n\nHowever, if it crosses into wastefulness or distracts from higher priorities (e.g., helping others), it becomes impermissible. Always prioritize balance and God-consciousness (*taqwā*).  \n\nIf uncertain, consult a trusted scholar who can assess your specific circumstances.  \n\n**وَاللّٰهُ أَعْلَمُ**  \n*And Allah knows best.*"}

Instruments like flutes, drums, or stringed devices are often debated.\n   - **Conservative Scholars**: Many classical scholars (e.g., Ibn Taymiyyah) and modern Salafi/Wahhabi schools deem all non-percussion instruments *haram* (forbidden), associating them with immoral behavior.\n\n### **2. Permissible or Conditional Views:**\n   - **Cultural and Spiritual Music**: Some scholars permit vocals (e.g., *nasheeds* without instruments) or frame drums (*daff*), especially for weddings or religious occasions.\n   - **Sufi and Cultural Practices**: Sufi traditions often use music (e.g., *qawwali*) as a spiritual tool. Many Muslim-majority cultures integrate music in celebrations.\n   - **Moderate Opinions**: Scholars like Al-Ghazali argued that music is permissible if it inspires piety and avoids vulgarity. Context matters—lyrics, intent, and setting determine acceptability.\n\n### **3. Key Considerations:**\n   - **Content**: Lyrics promoting sin (violence, indecency) are widely condemned.\n   - **Intent**: Music for mindfulness, relaxation, or worship may be more acceptable.\n   - **Scholarly Differences**: Schools of thought vary (e.g., Hanafi scholars are often more lenient than Hanbali).\n\n### **Conclusion**:\nThere is no unanimous ruling. Many Muslims avoid music entirely, while others enjoy it selectively. For personal guidance, consult a trusted scholar who understands your context.\n\n**Recommendation**: Reflect on whether music enriches your faith or distracts you from Islamic obligations.

(This) the interpretation of dreams (is of that which my Lord hath taught me. Lo! I have forsaken the religion of folk) I did not follow the religion of a people (who believe not in Allah and are disbelievers in) they are deniers of (the Hereafter) resurrection after death.<D>(This will be their welcome) this will be their food and drink (on the Day of Judgement) on the Day ofReckoning. <D>(Lo! this in truth is Our provision) this is the food and bliss We have for them, (which will never waste away)which will never cease or be interrupted. ", "Generated_Answer": "The permissibility of participating in or consuming food from a \"Fatiha\" ceremony (commonly understood as gatherings where Surah Al-Fatiha is recited and food is distributed in the name of the deceased) is assessed based on Islamic principles. Here is a concise breakdown:\n\n---\n\n### **1. Is the \"Fatiha\" Practice Permissible in Islam?**\n- **Islamic Ruling**:  \n  Acts of worship in Islam must align with the Qur’an and the Sunnah. The practice of organizing specific gatherings (e.g., on the 3rd, 7th, or 40th day after death) to recite Surah Al-Fatiha, distribute food, and attribute religious significance to these dates **is not established in the Qur’an or authentic Sunnah**.  \n  - Such rituals are considered **bidʿah (innovation)** if they are presented as acts of worship or obligatory rites. The Prophet ﷺ warned against introducing new practices into the religion, stating:  \n    > *\"Every innovation is misguidance, and every misguidance is in the Hellfire\"* (Muslim).  \n\n  - However, **general acts of charity** (e.g., feeding others) or making supplications (duʿāʾ) for the deceased are encouraged at any time, provided they are not tied to un-Islamic rituals.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Permissibility of Consuming the Food**\n- **General Rule**:  \n  The food itself is **halal** if it is:  \n  - Prepared with halal ingredients.  \n  - Not offered as part of a ritual that contradicts Islamic teachings (e.g., food sacrificed for idols or non-Islamic rites).  \n\n- **Key Considerations**:  \n  - If the food is distributed as **general charity (ṣadaqah)**, it is permissible to eat it.  \n  - If the gathering promotes bidʿah (e.g., believing the food distribution is a required religious rite for the deceased’s salvation), **participating in or endorsing such rituals is discouraged**. However, consuming the food alone does not necessarily imply endorsement if one’s intention is to avoid waste or foster family ties.  \n\n- **Scholarly Opinions**:  \n  Scholars like Ibn Taymiyyah and Ibn ʿUthaymīn emphasized that while the food itself may be halal, Muslims should avoid supporting innovations. If attending such gatherings normalizes bidʿah, it is better to abstain.  \n\n---\n\n### **3. Recommended Approach**\n- **Alternative Islamic Practices**:  \n  - Offer charity (ṣadaqah) in the name of the deceased at any time without restricting it to specific dates.  \n  - Make sincere duʿāʾ for the deceased and recite Qur’an (e.g., Surah Al-Fatiha) independently, dedicating the rewards to them.  \n  - Follow the Sunnah practices for mourning, such as comforting the family and supplicating for patience.  \n\n- **If Offered Food**:  \n  - If refusing would cause undue harm or strife, it is permissible to eat the food while **avoiding participation in the innovated ritual**. Clarify your stance politely if asked.  \n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n- **Fatiha ceremonies** tied to fixed dates/rituals are **religiously impermissible (bidʿah)**.  \n- The **food itself is halal** if it meets Islamic dietary guidelines, but one should avoid legitimizing innovations.  \n- Focus on Islamically prescribed acts of charity and supplication for the deceased.  \n\nMay Allah guide us to adhere to the Sunnah and avoid innovations. آمين."}

Legal Steps (Qanooni Charai)**\nNew York ke qanoon ke mutabiq:\n- **Property Ownership:** Agar ghar ke papers par apka naam nahi hai, to apko sab se pehle ek **real estate lawyer** se mashwara lena chahiye. Wo ye check karenge:\n  - Kya apne aur apne bhai ne koi written agreement ya contract banaya tha jab ghar khareeda tha?\n  - Agar apne 8 saal se 50% kharch diya hai, to kya ye proof (bank statements, receipts) hai?

From an Islamic perspective, this involves rulings related to **najasah (impurity)** and **tahaarah (cleanliness)** for prayer. Here’s a step-by-step guide to manage this according to Islamic jurisprudence (primarily based on the Hanafi school):\n\n---\n\n### **1. Medical Consultation**\n- **First priority:** Seek medical advice to diagnose and treat the underlying cause (e.g., weak sphincter muscles, infections, dietary issues, etc.). This condition is often treatable.\n- **Practical tip:** Use absorbent pads or adult diapers to contain leakage and protect your clothes.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Islamic Rulings on Cleanliness (Tahaarah)**\n#### **A. Removing Najasah (Impurity)**\n- Any fluid or stool exiting the anus is **najis (impure)** and must be cleaned before prayer.\n- **Istinjaah (cleaning after using the toilet):**  \n  - Wash the anal area thoroughly with water until no visible residue remains.  \n  - If the smell persists despite proper washing, it is **excused** as long as no physical residue is present. The Prophet ﷺ said: *\"Allah has forgiven my Ummah for what crosses their minds, as long as they do not act upon it or speak of it\"* (Bukhari). Residual odor alone does not invalidate purity.\n\n#### **B. Wudu (Ablution)**\n- **Leakage invalidates wudu.** If leakage occurs after you’ve performed wudu, you must renew it before praying.\n- **If leakage is continuous (istihadhah-like ruling):**  \n  - You are considered **ma’dhur** (excused due to chronic condition).  \n  - Perform wudu **once per prayer time** (e.g., make wudu for Dhuhr and pray all obligatory/optional prayers in that window, even if leakage occurs later).  \n  - If leakage stops completely, renew wudu for the next prayer.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Performing Salah**\n- **Clothing and body must be free from najasah:**  \n  - If leakage occurs, change soiled clothes or clean the affected area before praying.  \n  - Place a clean pad/barrier before prayer to absorb leakage during salah.  \n- **Pray even if leakage resumes:**  \n  - Do not delay prayer. If leakage happens during salah, continue praying. Clean yourself and renew wudu afterward for the next prayer.\n\n---\n\n### **4. Key Summary**\n| Action                     | Ruling                                                                 |\n|----------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Cleaning after leakage** | Wash the area until no visible residue remains. Residual smell is excused. |\n| **Wudu**                   | Renew it if leakage occurs after wudu. For continuous leakage, perform wudu once per prayer time. |\n| **Salah**                  | Pray on time. Use pads to protect clothes. If soiling occurs during salah, complete the prayer and clean afterward. |\n| **Medical Help**           | Strongly recommended to resolve the issue permanently.                |\n\n---\n\n### **5. Spiritual Reassurance**\n- Allah does not burden a soul beyond its capacity (Quran 2:286). Your sincere efforts to maintain purity are accepted, and prayer in this state is valid as long as you follow the above steps.\n- The Prophet ﷺ said: *\"When a Muslim falls ill, Allah sheds his sins as a tree sheds its leaves\"* (Bukhari). Seek Allah’s reward through patience and consistent prayer.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Advice**\n1. **Medical treatment:** Prioritize seeing a gastroenterologist.  \n2. **Islamic precautions:** Use high-quality absorbent pads, maintain strict hygiene, and follow the rulings for ma’dhur.  \n3. **Prayer continuity:** Never miss salah due to this issue—adapt using the guidelines above.\n\nMay Allah grant you healing, ease, and acceptance of your worship.

Here’s a breakdown of your concerns:\n\n### 1. **Toothpaste**:\n   - **Permissible if unscented**: Use toothpaste **without fragrance** (e.g., unflavored or specifically \"Ihraam-safe\" variants). \n   - **Alternatives**: The **miswak (siwak)** is highly recommended, as it is natural, scent-free, and Sunnah.\n   - **Avoid scented toothpaste**: Mint or flavored toothpaste is discouraged due to its fragrance, which violates Ihraam restrictions.\n\n### 2. **Mint Sweets/Candies**:\n   - **Avoid strongly scented mints**: If the sweets have a **noticeable fragrance** (e.g., peppermint oil), they are prohibited, as inhaling or consuming strong scents is not allowed.\n   - **Non-fragrant alternatives**: Opt for plain sweets without added perfumes or oils. If the mint is mild and not inhaled intentionally, some scholars permit it—but caution is advised.\n\n### 3. **Other Fragrant Foods**:\n   - **Avoid foods meant for fragrance**: Foods intentionally scented (e.g., rose-flavored desserts, perfumed spices) are prohibited.\n   - **Naturally fragrant foods**: Foods with subtle natural scents (e.g., fruits) are generally allowed, but avoid those with **added perfume** (e.g., saffron-heavy dishes if the scent is strong).\n\n### Key Principles:\n   - **No intentional use of fragrance**: Perfumes, scented oils, and products designed for aroma (even in food) are forbidden in Ihraam.\n   - **Hygiene is still important**: Use unscented soap, toothpaste, and deodorant. Ghusl (ritual bath) is permitted with fragrance-free products.\n   - **Accidental exposure**: Unintentional contact with fragrance (e.g., walking past a scented area) does not invalidate Ihraam, but you must avoid it once aware.\n\n### Final Advice:\n- Stick to **unscented products** for toothpaste, soap, and skincare.\n- Avoid **mint sweets/candies** unless confirmed to be fragrance-free.\n- When in doubt, choose simplicity and caution to uphold the sanctity of Ihraam.\n\nIf uncertain about a specific product, consult a trusted scholar or your Hajj/Umrah guide for clarity.

Here's a concise breakdown:\n\n---\n\n### **1. Hanafi View: Zakat is Obligatory**\n- **Gold and silver jewelry** (even if worn regularly) is subject to Zakat if their total value reaches the **nisab** (minimum threshold: ~85g for gold, ~595g for silver).  \n- **Reasoning**: Gold/silver are inherently monetary assets, so they are zakatable regardless of their use.  \n- **Calculation**: 2.5% of the total value is paid annually.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Shafi'i/Maliki/Hanbali View: Zakat is Not Obligatory**\n- **Personal-use jewelry** (worn for adornment, not for investment/hoarding) is **exempt** from Zakat.  \n- **Reasoning**: Based on hadith where the Prophet (PBUH) exempted women’s jewelry (e.g., *Sunan Abu Dawood* 1563).  \n- **Exception**: If jewelry exceeds \"reasonable personal use\" (e.g., stored unused or owned in excessive quantities), some scholars may require Zakat.  \n\n---\n\n### **Key Considerations**\n- **Nisab Threshold**: Calculate based on current gold/silver prices.  \n- **Intention Matters**: Jewelry bought for investment or trade is always zakatable.  \n- **Other Assets**: Ensure other zakatable assets (cash, business goods, etc.) are included in your Zakat calculation.  \n\n---\n\n### **Practical Advice**\n1. **Follow your school of thought** (madhab).  \n2. **When in doubt**:  \n   - Calculate Zakat on jewelry if following the Hanafi view.  \n   - Exempt it if following the Shafi'i/Maliki/Hanbali view unless it’s clearly excessive.  \n3. **Consult a local scholar** for personalized guidance based on your situation.  \n\nMay Allah reward your sincerity in seeking knowledge and fulfilling your obligations!"}
{"Question": "Q: My question is about sadaqa. Is it allowed in Islam that the meat of sadaqa which is given to a madrasa for orphan Quran students is used in meelaad sharif programmes and eaten by rich people? ? --T--", "Answer": "It is not permissible. And Allah Taala ( ) knows best", "Document": "Narrated Anas:Al-Muhajirun (i.e. the Emigrants) and the Ansar were digging the trench around Medina and were carrying the earth on their backs while saying, \"We are those who have given the pledge of allegiance to Muhammad for Islam as long as we live.\" The Prophet said in reply to their saying, \"O Allah! There is no goodness except the goodness of the Hereafter; so please grant Your Blessing to the Ansar and the Emigrants.\" The people used to bring a handful of barley, and a meal used to be prepared thereof by cooking it with a cooking material (i.e. oil, fat and butter having a change in color and smell) and it used to be presented to the people (i.e. workers) who were hungry, and it used to stick to their throats and had a nasty smell.<D>Narrated `Aisha:The Prophet did not do that (i.e., forbade the storage of the meat of sacrifices for three days) except (he did so) so that the rich would feed the poor. But later we used to keep even trotters to cook, fifteen days later. The family of Muhammad did not eat wheat bread with meat or soup to their satisfaction for three successive days.<D>Narrated Abu Huraira:Allahs Apostle said \"We are the last (to come amongst the nations) but (will be) the foremost on the Day of Resurrection. They were giventhe Holy Scripture before us and we were given the Quran after them. And this was the day (Friday) about which they differed and Allah gaveus the guidance (for that). So tomorrow (i.e. Saturday) is the Jews (day), and the day after tomorrow (i.e. Sunday) is the Christians.\" The Prophet (p.b.u.h) remained silent (for a while) and then said, \"Itis obligatory for every Muslim that he should take a bath once in seven days, when he should wash his head and body.\"<D>(And they used to say) in the life of the world: (When we are dead and have come) scattered (dust and)rotten (bones, shall we then, forsooth, be raised again) shall we then be given life again, <D>(And thou wilt see each nation) the adherents of each religion (crouching) gathered, (each nation) the adherents of each religion (summoned to its record) to read the record of their good and bad deeds; some will be given their record in their right hands and others in their left.

The Donor's Intention (Niyyah)**\n- **Primary consideration**: If the donor explicitly specified that the sadaqa is **exclusively for orphans**, it is **impermissible** to divert it to others, regardless of the occasion (Meelaad or otherwise). Violating this condition breaches the trust (*amanah*) and invalidates the charity’s purpose.\n- If the donor gave *general* sadaqa for the madrasa (without specifying orphans), the institution may have flexibility, provided the usage aligns with broader charitable goals (e.g., communal benefit).\n\n---\n\n### **2. Eligibility of Recipients**\nSadaqa must primarily benefit the **poor and needy**, as stated in the Quran:\n> ***\"Charities are only for the poor, the needy...\"*** (Quran 9:60).\n\n- **Orphans** are among the most deserving recipients of sadaqa. Using their allocated resources for non-needy people (e.g., wealthy attendees) contradicts this principle.\n- If wealthy people consume the meat while orphans are deprived, it constitutes **misappropriation** and defeats the purpose of sadaqa.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Meelaad Sharif and Communal Events**\n- While Meelaad gatherings (celebrating the Prophet’s birthday) are permitted by many scholars as acts of love for the Prophet ﷺ, they must be funded through **non-sadaqa sources** if they involve feeding wealthy attendees.\n- Sadaqa resources should **never prioritize the rich over the poor**. If the event includes orphans and needy participants alongside others, the meat may be shared, but orphans must not be deprived.\n\n---\n\n### **4. Scholarly Opinions**\n- **Classical View**: Scholars like Ibn Taymiyyah and Ibn al-Qayyim emphasize strict adherence to donor stipulations and prioritizing the needy.\n- **Modern Fatwas**: Contemporary scholars (e.g., Mufti Taqi Usmani) state that designated sadaqa must be used as intended; diverting it requires valid reasons (e.g., surplus after fulfilling the original purpose).\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n- **Not Permissible** if the meat was **explicitly donated for orphans** and is diverted to feed wealthy people at Meelaad, as this violates:\n  - The donor’s conditions (*shurut al-waqif*),\n  - The Quranic directive to prioritize the poor,\n  - The ethical obligation to protect orphans’ rights.\n- **Permissible Only If**:\n  - The donation was general (not specified for orphans), **and**\n  - The orphans’ needs are fully met first, **and**\n  - The Meelaad event includes orphans and serves a genuine communal benefit (e.g., education, spiritual upliftment).\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendation**\n- The madrasa should **separate funds**:\n  - Use sadaqa **exclusively for orphans**.\n  - Fund Meelaad programs through **general donations** or non-sadaqa sources.\n- If misuse occurs, donors should clarify their intentions or redirect sadaqa to trustworthy institutions.\n\nMay Allah reward your concern for upholding the rights of the vulnerable and ensuring charity reaches its rightful recipients.

{"Question": "Could you elaborate on the rulings for physical activities and sports in the Hanafi madhab (e.g. running for physical health, basketball with friends, etc.)? Does ones intention have an influence on the ruling? [is it acceptable to read fictional novels as a hobby or to pass time,] ? --T--", "Answer": "Assalamu alaikum, Someone else answered: In the Hanafi (Allah bless our Imams!) madhhab every form of amusement that doesnt have a religious purpose is Makruh Tahriman NOTE: This is not strictly speaking true. Anything that has a worldly or religious purpose or benefit is not blameworthy in the Hanafi school, as scholars and the texts explain. Therefore, if you like to read English literature, this would not be blameworthy (unless it leads, in your case, to something blameworthy) because reading literature has clear benefits. Of course, you would not have reward for these benefits without intending something noble. The same thing would apply to sports if done for recreational purposes, for ones health or to bring brothers together over a lawful activity, as long as they are free of anything blameworthy in the Shariah (such as excessive wasting of time that leads to foregoing ones worldly or religious responsibilities, or swearing, players without their awra covered, etc). Unfortunately, there is often much that is blameworthy in recreational sports these days, so one should be careful", "Document": "It was narrated that Humaid bin Abdur-Rahman said:\"I met a man who accompanied the Prophet () as Abu Hurairah (may Allah be pleased with him), accompanied him for four years. He said: The Messenger of Allah () forbade any one of us to comb his hair each day,[1] or to urinate in the place where he performs Ghusl, or for a man to perform Ghusl using the leftover water of a women, or a woman to perform Ghusl using the leftover water of a man - they should scoop it out together.\"[1] It is said this is to prevent him from making his physical appearance his main aim.<D>Al Miswar bin Makhramah said :The Messenger of Allah () came out in the year of al-Hudaibbiyyah with over ten hundreds of Companions and when he came to Dhu al Hulaifah. He garlanded and marked the sacrificial animals, and entered the sacred state of Umrah. He then went on with the tradition. The Prophet moved on and when he came to the mountain, pass by which one descends (to Mecca) to them, his riding-beast knelt down, and the people said twice: Go on, go on, al-Qaswa has become jaded. The Prophet (May peace be upon him) said: She has not become jaded and that is not a characteristic of hers, but He Who restrained the elephant has restrained her. He then said: By Him in Whose hand my soul is, they will not ask any me good thing by which they honor which God has made sacred without my giving them it. He then urged her and she leaped up and he turned aside from them, and stopped at the farthest side of al-Hudaibiyyah at a pool with little water. Meanwhile Budail bin Warqa al-Khuza’I came, and ‘Urwah bin Mas’ud joined him. He began to speak to the Prophet (). Whenever he spoke to the Prophet (), he caught his beard. Al Mughriah bin Shu’bah was standing beside the Prophet ().He had a sword with him, wearing a helmet. He (Al Mughriah) struck his (‘Urwah’s) hand with the lower end of his sheath, and said: Keep away your hand from his beard. ‘Urwah then raised his hand and asked: Who is this? They replied: Al-Mughirah bin Shu’bah. He said: O treacherous one! Did I not use my offices in your treachery? In pre-Islamic days Al-Mughirah bin Shu’bah accompanied some people and murdered them, and took their property. He then came (to the Prophet) and embraced Islam. The Prophet () said: As for Islam we accepted it, but as to the property, as it has been taken by treachery, we have no need of it. He went on with the tradition the Prophet () said: Write down: This is what Muhammad, the Messenger of Allah, has decided. He then narrated the tradition. Suhail then said: And that a man will not come to you from us, even if he follows your religion, without you sending him back to us. When he finished drawing up the document, the Prophet () said to his Companions: Get up and sacrifice and then shave. Thereafter some believing women who were immigrants came. (Allah sent down: O yea who believe, when believing women come to you as emigrants). Allah most high forbade them to send them back, but ordered them to restore the dower. He then returned to Medina. Abu Basir a man from the Quraish (who was a Muslim), came to him. And they sent (two men) to look for him; so he handed him over to the two men. They took him away, and when they reached Dhu Al Hulaifah and alighted to eat some dates which they had, Abu Basir said to one of the men : I swear by Allah so-and-so, that I think this sword of yours is a fine one; the other drew the sword and said : Yes I have tried it. Abu Basir said: Let me look at it. He let him have it and he struck him till he died, whereupon the other fled and came to Medina, and running entered the mosque. The Prophet ( may peace be upon him) said: This man has seen something frightful. He said: I swear by Allah that my Companion has been killed, and im as good as dead. Abu Basir then arrived and said: Allah has fulfilled your covenant. You returned me to them, but Allah saved me from them. The Prophet () said: Woe to his mother, stirrer up of war!

Here are key considerations:\n\n1. **Permissibility**:\n   - Activities like running, swimming, basketball, or martial arts are allowed if they:\n     - Do not involve **harām** elements (e.g., nudity, free mixing between genders, gambling, or violating modesty rules).\n     - Do not cause severe harm (e.g., excessively dangerous sports without necessity).\n     - Do not distract from obligatory acts of worship (e.g., missing prayers).\n\n2. **Intention (Niyyah)**:\n   - Intention plays a significant role. If the activity is for **legitimate purposes** (e.g., health, discipline, self-defense, brotherhood), it is encouraged as a means of maintaining Allah’s trust (the body).\n   - If done for **vain purposes** (e.g., showing off, wasting time, or neglecting duties), it may become blameworthy (**makrūh**).\n\n3. **Moderation**:\n   - The Prophet ﷺ encouraged physical strength (e.g., archery, swimming, horseback riding). Excessiveness that leads to neglect of religious or worldly duties is discouraged.\n\n4. **Clothing and Environment**:\n   - Clothing must comply with **Islamic modesty** (covering *‘awrah*). Men must cover from navel to knees; women must cover everything except hands and face in non-mahram company.\n   - Mixed-gender sports are prohibited in Hanafi fiqh unless strict gender segregation is maintained.\n\n---\n\n### **Reading Fictional Novels in the Hanafi Perspective**\nThe permissibility of reading fictional novels hinges on **content, intent, and consequences**:\n\n1. **General Ruling**:\n   - Fiction is permissible (**mubāḥ**) if:\n     - It contains no **harām themes** (e.g., lewdness, falsehood, promotion of sin, shirk).\n     - It does not distort Islamic values or promote immorality.\n   - If the novel includes harām elements, reading it becomes impermissible (**harām**).\n\n2. **Intention and Impact**:\n   - **Permissible intent**: Reading as a harmless hobby, language improvement, or mental relaxation is allowed.\n   - **Blameworthy intent**: If it leads to neglecting obligations (e.g., prayer, family duties), spreads false ideas, or consumes excessive time, it becomes discouraged (**makrūh**).\n\n3. **Scholarly Views**:\n   - Some classical scholars cautioned against fiction if it distracts from beneficial knowledge or reality. Modern scholars often permit it if content is clean and time is balanced.\n   - Hanafi scholars emphasize avoiding **al-ghaflah** (heedlessness) and **ḍā‘iyat al-waqt** (time-wasting).\n\n---\n\n### **Key Principles of the Hanafi School**\n1. **Maslahah (Public Interest)**:\n   - Activities supporting health, community bonding, or discipline are prioritized if they align with Sharī‘ah.\n\n2. **Sadd al-Dharā’i‘ (Blocking the Means)**:\n   - Even permissible acts become harām if they lead to sin (e.g., sports encouraging pride or novels normalizing sin).\n\n3. **‘Urf (Custom)**:\n   - Local norms influence rulings (e.g., acceptable sports in one culture may differ from another).\n\n---\n\n### **Final Advice**\n- **Physical Activities**: Engage in sports with pure intentions, modesty, and balance. Use them to strengthen your body for Allah’s service.\n- **Reading**: Choose literature that enriches your mind or soul. Avoid content that corrupts faith or morals.\n- **Consult Scholars**: For specific cases (e.g., competitive sports with risks), seek guidance from a qualified Hanafi scholar.\n\nAllah says:  \n*\"And do not throw yourselves into destruction\"* (Quran 2:195).  \nThe Prophet ﷺ said: *\"The strong believer is better and more beloved to Allah than the weak believer\"* (Muslim 2664).  \n\nBalance worldly enjoyment with obedience to Allah, and let your intentions elevate permissible acts into acts of worship."}
{"Question": "Answered by Shaykh Ilyas PatelI have a huge problem concerning brotherhood in Islam. I started practicing in my teen years and day by day MashAllah my deen goes up. I just found out that a brother I know for long time is talking behind my back and he and some other people judge for the way I dress, walk, and talk. They are always trying to bring me down. In fact it seems they hate me deep inside just because the way I am. I feel depressed and it hurts me, brothers judging other brothers outwardly. What should I do? And what does Islam say about backbiting.? --T--", "Answer": "In the Name of Allah, Most Merciful and CompassionateThese brothers who are judging you outwardly is because of their lack of iman and understanding, though they know it is wrong to backbite. They havent come to realise its severity. It is good of you being concerned and wanting them to like you as you are, but this is not the case all the time. You can be judged wrongly even if you are like them. Try to dress in western clothing also and be as normal as you are, in order to show your friends that you are no different when you wear what they are wearing. Also a good way to make them closer is to give gifts. On the other hand, if they are completely off the track and affecting your din then you should try to avoid them and pray to Allah to guide them and keep you steadfast, but keep ties with them by meeting them occasionally or by giving gifts.Ghiba (Backbiting and slander) is a major sin and is a very common ailment in our society. It means to mention anything concerning a person that he would dislike, whether about his body, religion, everyday life, self, disposition, property, son, father, wife, servant, turban, garment, gait Allah clearly mentions in the Quran:Woe to whoever disparages others behind their back or to their face(Koran 104:1)There are other verses and ahadith against backbiting.May Allah save us all from this evil, amin", "Document": "Narrated Aisha:(The wife of the Prophet) Whenever Allahs Apostle intended to go on a journey, he used to draw lots among his wives and would take with him the one on whom the lot had fallen. Once he drew lots when he wanted to carry out a Ghazwa, and the lot came upon me. So I proceeded with Allahs Apostle after Allahs order of veiling (the women) had been revealed and thus I was carried in my howdah (on a camel) and dismounted while still in it. We carried on our journey, and when Allahs Apostle had finished his Ghazwa and returned and we approached Medina, Allahs Apostle ordered to proceed at night. When the army was ordered to resume the homeward journey, I got up and walked on till I left the army (camp) behind. When I had answered the call of nature, I went towards my howdah, but behold ! A necklace of mine made of Jaz Azfar (a kind of black bead) was broken and I looked for it and my search for it detained me. The group of people who used to carry me, came and carried my howdah on to the back of my camel on which I was riding, considering that I was therein. At that time women were light in weight and were not fleshy for they used to eat little (food), so those people did not feel the lightness of the howdah while raising it up, and I was still a young lady. They drove away the camel and proceeded. Then I found my necklace after the army had gone. I came to their camp but found nobody therein so I went to the place where I used to stay, thinking that they would miss me and come back in my search. While I was sitting at my place, I felt sleepy and slept. Safwan bin Al-Muattil As-Sulami Adh- Dhakw-ani was behind the army. He had started in the last part of the night and reached my stationing place in the morning and saw the figure of a sleeping person. He came to me and recognized me on seeing me for he used to see me before veiling. I got up because of his saying: \"Inna Li l-lahi wa inna ilaihi rajiun,\" which he uttered on recognizing me. I covered my face with my garment, and by Allah, he did not say to me a single word except, \"Inna Li l-lahi wa inna ilaihi rajiun,\" till he made his shecamel kneel down whereupon he trod on its forelegs and I mounted it. Then Safwan set out, leading the she-camel that was carrying me, till we met the army while they were resting during the hot midday. Then whoever was meant for destruction, fell in destruction, and the leader of the Ifk (forged statement) was `Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul. After this we arrived at Medina and I became ill for one month while the people were spreading the forged statements of the people of the Ifk, and I was not aware of anything thereof. But what aroused my doubt while I was sick, was that I was no longer receiving from Allahs Apostle the same kindness as I used to receive when I fell sick. Allahs Apostle would enter upon me, say a greeting and add, \"How is that (lady)?\" and then depart. That aroused my suspicion but I was not aware of the propagated evil till I recovered from my ailment. I went out with Um Mistah to answer the call of nature towards Al-Manasi, the place where we used to relieve ourselves, and used not to go out for this purpose except from night to night, and that was before we had lavatories close to our houses. And this habit of ours was similar to the habit of the old Arabs (in the deserts or in the tents) concerning the evacuation of the bowels, for we considered it troublesome and harmful to take lavatories in the houses. So I went out with Um Mistah who was the daughter of Abi Ruhm bin `Abd Manaf, and her mother was daughter of Sakhr bin Amir who was the aunt of Abi Bakr As-Siddiq, and her son was Mistah bin Uthatha. When we had finished our affair, Um Mistah and I came back towards my house. Um Mistah stumbled over her robe whereupon she said, \"Let Mistah be ruined ! \" I said to her, \"What a bad word you have said! Do you abuse a man who has taken part in the Battle of Badr? She said, \"O you there! Didnt you hear what he has said?\" I said, \"And what did he say?\" She then told me the statement of the people of the Ifk (forged statement) which added to my ailment. When I returned home, Allahs Apostle came to me, and after greeting, he said, \"How is that (lady)?\" I said, \"Will you allow me to go to my parents?\" At that time I intended to be sure of the news through them. Allahs Apostle allowed me and I went to my parents and asked my mother, \"O my mother! What are the people talking about?\" My mother said, \"O my daughter! Take it easy, for by Allah, there is no charming lady who is loved by her husband who has other wives as well, but that those wives would find fault with her.\" I said, \"Subhan Allah! Did the people really talk about that?\" That night I kept on weeping the whole night till the morning. My tears never stopped, nor did I sleep, and morning broke while I was still weeping, Allahs Apostle called `Ali bin Abi Talib and Usama bin Zaid when the Divine Inspiration delayed, in order to consult them as to the idea of divorcing his wife. Usama bin Zaid told Allahs Apostle of what he knew about the innocence of his wife and of his affection he kept for her. He said, \"O Allahs Apostle! She is your wife, and we do not know anything about her except good.\" But `Ali bin Abi Talib said, \"O Allahs Apostle! Allah does not impose restrictions on you; and there are plenty of women other than her. If you however, ask (her) slave girl, she will tell you the truth.\" `Aisha added: So Allahs Apostle called for Barira and said, \"O Barira! Did you ever see anything which might have aroused your suspicion? (as regards Aisha). Barira said, \"By Allah Who has sent you with the truth, I have never seen anything regarding Aisha which I would blame her for except that she is a girl of immature age who sometimes sleeps and leaves the dough of her family unprotected so that the domestic goats come and eat it.\" So Allahs Apostle got up (and addressed) the people an asked for somebody who would take revenge on `Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul then. Allahs Apostle, while on the pulpit, said, \"O Muslims! Who will help me against a man who has hurt me by slandering my family? By Allah, I know nothing except good about my family, and people have blamed a man of whom I know nothing except good, and he never used to visit my family except with me,\" Sa`d bin Mu`adh Al-Ansari got up and said, \"O Allahs Apostle! By Allah, I will relieve you from him. If he be from the tribe of (Bani) Al-Aus, then I will chop his head off; and if he be from our brethren, the Khazraj, then you give us your order and we will obey it.\" On that, Sa`d bin Ubada got up, and he was the chief of the Khazraj, and before this incident he had been a pious man but he was incited by his zeal for his tribe. He said to Sa`d (bin Mu`adh), \"By Allah the Eternal, you have told a lie! You shall not kill him and you will never be able to kill him!\" On that, Usaid bin Hudair, the cousin of Sa`d (bin Mu`adh) got up and said to Sa`d bin Ubada, \"You are a liar! By Allah the Eternal, we will surely kill him; and you are a hypocrite defending the hypocrites!\" So the two tribes of Al-Aus and Al-Khazraj got excited till they were on the point of fighting with each other while Allahs Apostle was standing on the pulpit. Allahs Apostle continued quietening them till they became silent whereupon he became silent too. On that day I kept on weeping so much that neither did my tears stop, nor could I sleep. In the morning my parents were with me, and I had wept for two nights and a day without sleeping and with incessant tears till they thought that my liver would burst with weeping. While they were with me and I was weeping, an Ansari woman asked permission to see me. I admitted her and she sat and started weeping with me. While I was in that state, Allahs Apostle came to us, greeted, and sat down,. He had never sat with me since the day what was said, was said. He had stayed a month without receiving any Divine Inspiration concerning my case. Allahs Apostle recited the Tashahhud after he had sat down, and then said, \"Thereafter, O `Aisha! I have been informed such and-such a thing about you; and if you are innocent, Allah will reveal your innocence, and if you have committed a sin, then ask for Allahs forgiveness and repent to Him, for when a slave confesses his sin and then repents to Allah, Allah accepts his repentance.\" When Allahs Apostle had finished his speech, my tears ceased completely so that I no longer felt even a drop thereof. Then I said to my father, \"Reply to Allahs Apostle on my behalf as to what he said.\" He said, \"By Allah, I do not know what to say to Allahs Apostle.\" Then I said to my mother, \"Reply to Allahs Apostle.\" She said, \"I do not know what to say to Allahs Apostle.\" Still a young girl as I was and though I had little knowledge of Quran, I said, \"By Allah, I know that you heard this story (of the Ifk) so much so that it has been planted in your minds and you have believed it. So now, if I tell you that I am innocent, and Allah knows that I am innocent, you will not believe me; and if I confess something, and Allah knows that I am innocent of it, you will believe me. By Allah, I cannot find of you an example except that of Josephs father: \"So (for me) patience is most fitting against that which you assert and it is Allah (Alone) Whose help can be sought. Then I turned away and lay on my bed, and at that time I knew that I was innocent and that Allah would reveal my innocence. But by Allah, I never thought that Allah would sent down about my affair, Divine Inspiration that would be recited (forever), as I considered myself too unworthy to be talked of by Allah with something that was to be recited: but I hoped that Allahs Apostle might have a vision in which Allah would prove my innocence. By Allah, Allahs Apostle had not left his seat and nobody had left the house when the Divine Inspiration came to Allahs Apostle . So there overtook him the same hard condition which used to overtake him (when he was Divinely Inspired) so that the drops of his sweat were running down, like pearls, though it was a (cold) winter day, and that was because of the heaviness of the Statement which was revealed to him. When that state of Allahs Apostle was over, and he was smiling when he was relieved, the first word he said was, \"Aisha, Allah has declared your innocence.\" My mother said to me, \"Get up and go to him.\" I said, \"By Allah, I will not go to him and I will not thank anybody but Allah.\" So Allah revealed: \"Verily! They who spread the Slander are a gang among you. Think it not....\" (24.11-20). When Allah revealed this to confirm my innocence, Abu Bakr As-Siddiq who used to provide for Mistah bin Uthatha because of the latters kinship to him and his poverty, said, \"By Allah, I will never provide for Mistah anything after what he has said about Aisha\". So Allah revealed: (continued...) (continuing... 1): -6.274:... ... \"Let not those among you who are good and are wealthy swear not to give (help) to their kinsmen, those in need, and those who have left their homes for Allahs Cause. Let them Pardon and forgive (i.e. do not punish them). Do you not love that should forgive you? Verily Allah is Oft-forgiving. Most Merciful.\" (24.22) Abu Bakr said, \"Yes, by Allah, I wish that Allah should forgive me.\" So he resumed giving Mistah the aid he used to give him before and said, \"By Allah, I will never withold it from him at all.\" Aisha further said: Allahs Apostle also asked Zainab bint Jahsh about my case. He said, \"O Zainab! What have you seen?\" She replied, \"O Allahs Apostle! I protect my hearing and my sight (by refraining from telling lies). I know nothing but good (about Aisha).\" Of all the wives of Allahs Apostle, it was Zainab who aspired to receive from him the same favor as I used to receive, yet, Allah saved her (from telling lies) because of her piety. But her sister, Hamna, kept on fighting on her behalf so she was destroyed as were those who invented and spread the slander.<D>Narrated Anas bin Malik:That when Haram bin Milhan, his uncle was stabbed on the day of Bir Mauna he sprinkled his blood over his face and his head this way and then said, \"I have succeeded, by the Lord of the Ka`ba.<D>Narrated Aisha:(the wife of the Prophet) \"Whenever Allahs Apostle intended to go on a journey, he would draw lots amongst his wives and would take with him the one upon whom the lot fell. During a Ghazwa of his, he drew lots amongst us and the lot fell upon me, and I proceeded with him after Allah had decreed the use of the veil by women. I was carried in a Howdah (on the camel) and dismounted while still in it. When Allahs Apostle was through with his Ghazwa and returned home, and we approached the city of Medina, Allahs Apostle ordered us to proceed at night. When the order of setting off was given, I walked till I was past the army to answer the call of nature. After finishing I returned (to the camp) to depart (with the others) and suddenly realized that my necklace over my chest was missing. So, I returned to look for it and was delayed because of that. The people who used to carry me on the camel, came to my Howdah and put it on the back of the camel, thinking that I was in it, as, at that time, women were light in weight, and thin and lean, and did not use to eat much. So, those people did not feel the difference in the heaviness of the Howdah while lifting it, and they put it over the camel. At that time I was a young lady. They set the camel moving and proceeded on. I found my necklace after the army had gone, and came to their camp to find nobody. So, I went to the place where I used to stay, thinking that they would discover my absence and come back in my search. While in that state, I felt sleepy and slept. Safwan bin Muattal As-Sulami Adh-Dhakwani was behind the army and reached my abode in the morning. When he saw a sleeping person, he came to me, and he used to see me before veiling. So, I got up when I heard him saying, \"Inna lil-lah-wa inn a ilaihi rajiun (We are for Allah, and we will return to Him).\" He made his camel knell down. He got down from his camel, and put his leg on the front legs of the camel and then I rode and sat over it. Safwan set out walking, leading the camel by the rope till we reached the army who had halted to take rest at midday. Then whoever was meant for destruction, fell into destruction, (some people accused me falsely) and the leader of the false accusers was `Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul. After that we returned to Medina, and I became ill for one month while the people were spreading the forged statements of the false accusers. I was feeling during my ailment as if I were not receiving the usual kindness from the Prophet which I used to receive from him when I got sick. But he would come, greet and say, How is that (girl)? I did not know anything of what was going on till I recovered from my ailment and went out with Um Mistah to the Manasi where we used to answer the call of nature, and we used not to go to answer the call of nature except from night to night and that was before we had lavatories near to our houses. And this habit of ours was similar to the habit of the old Arabs in the open country (or away from houses). So. I and Um Mistah bint Ruhm went out walking. Um Mistah stumbled because of her long dress and on that she said, Let Mistah be ruined. I said, You are saying a bad word. Why are you abusing a man who took part in (the battle of) Badr? She said, O Hanata (you there) didnt you hear what they said? Then she told me the rumors of the false accusers. My sickness was aggravated, and when I returned home, Allahs Apostle came to me, and after greeting he said, How is that (girl)? I requested him to allow me to go to my parents. I wanted then to be sure of the news through them I Allahs Apostle allowed me, and I went to my parents and asked my mother, What are the people talking about? She said, O my daughter! Dont worry much about this matter. By Allah, never is there a charming woman loved by her husband who has other wives, but the women would forge false news about her. I said, Glorified be Allah! Are the people really taking of this matter? That night I kept on weeping and could not sleep till morning. In the morning Allahs Apostle called `Ali bin Abu Talib and Usama bin Zaid when he saw the Divine Inspiration delayed, to consul them about divorcing his wife (i.e. `Aisha). Usama bin Zaid said what he knew of the good reputation of his wives and added, O Allahs Apostle! Keep you wife, for, by Allah, we know nothing about her but good. `Ali bin Abu Talib said, O Allahs Apostle! Allah has no imposed restrictions on you, and there are many women other than she, yet you may ask the woman-servant who will tell you the truth. On that Allahs Apostle called Buraira and said, O Burair. Did you ever see anything which roused your suspicions about her? Buraira said, No, by Allah Who has sent you with the Truth, I have never seen in her anything faulty except that she is a girl of immature age, who sometimes sleeps and leaves the dough for the goats to eat. On that day Allahs Apostle ascended the pulpit and requested that somebody support him in punishing `Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul. Allahs Apostle said, Who will support me to punish that person (`Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul) who has hurt me by slandering the reputation of my family? By Allah, I know nothing about my family but good, and they have accused a person about whom I know nothing except good, and he never entered my house except in my company. Sa`d bin Mu`adh got up and said, O Allahs Apostle! by Allah, I will relieve you from him. If that man is from the tribe of the Aus, then we will chop his head off, and if he is from our brothers, the Khazraj, then order us, and we will fulfill your order. On that Sa`d bin Ubada, the chief of the Khazraj and before this incident, he had been a pious man, got up, motivated by his zeal for his tribe and said, By Allah, you have told a lie; you cannot kill him, and you will never be able to kill him. On that Usaid bin Al-Hadir got up and said (to Sa`d bin Ubada), By Allah! you are a liar. By Allah, we will kill him; and you are a hypocrite, defending the hypocrites. On this the two tribes of Aus and Khazraj got excited and were about to fight each other, while Allahs Apostle was standing on the pulpit. He got down and quieted them till they became silent and he kept quiet. On that day I kept on weeping so much so that neither did my tears stop, nor could I sleep. In the morning my parents were with me and I had wept for two nights and a day, till I thought my liver would burst from weeping. While they were sitting with me and I was weeping, an Ansari woman asked my permission to enter, and I allowed her to come in. She sat down and started weeping with me. While we were in this state, Allahs Apostle came and sat down and he had never sat with me since the day they forged the accusation. No revelation regarding my case came to him for a month. He recited Tashah-hud (i.e. None has the right to be worshipped but Allah and Muhammad is His Apostle) and then said, O `Aisha! I have been informed such-and-such about you; if you are innocent, then Allah will soon reveal your innocence, and if you have committed a sin, then repent to Allah and ask Him to forgive you, for when a person confesses his sin and asks Allah for forgiveness, Allah accepts his repentance. When Allahs Apostle finished his speech my tears ceased completely and there remained not even a single drop of it. I requested my father to reply to Allahs Apostle on my behalf. My father said, By Allah, I do not know what to say to Allahs Apostle. I said to my mother, Talk to Allahs Apostle on my behalf. She said, By Allah, I do not know what to say to Allahs Apostle. I was a young girl and did not have much knowledge of the Quran. I said. I know, by Allah, that you have listened to what people are saying and that has been planted in your minds and you have taken it as a truth. Now, if I told you that I am innocent and Allah knows that I am innocent, you would not believe me and if I confessed to you falsely that I am guilty, and Allah knows that I am innocent you would believe me. By Allah, I dont compare my situation with you except to the situation of Josephs father (i.e. Jacob) who said, So (for me) patience is most fitting against that which you assert and it is Allah (Alone) whose help can be sought. Then I turned to the other side of my bed hoping that Allah would prove my innocence. By Allah I never thought that Allah would reveal Divine Inspiration in my case, as I considered myself too inferior to be talked of in the Holy Quran. I had hoped that Allahs Apostle might have a dream in which Allah would prove my innocence. By Allah, Allahs Apostle had not got up and nobody had left the house before the Divine Inspiration came to Allahs Apostle. So, there overtook him the same state which used to overtake him, (when he used to have, on being inspired divinely). He was sweating so much so that the drops of the sweat were dropping like pearls though it was a (cold) wintry day. When that state of Allahs Apostle was over, he was smiling and the first word he said, `Aisha! Thank Allah, for Allah has declared your innocence. My mother told me to go to Allahs Apostle . I replied, By Allah I will not go to him and will not thank but Allah. So Allah revealed: \"Verily! They who spread the slander are a gang among you . . .\" (24.11) When Allah gave the declaration of my Innocence, Abu Bakr, who used to provide for Mistah bin Uthatha for he was his relative, said, By Allah, I will never provide Mistah with anything because of what he said about Aisha. But Allah later revealed: -- \"And let not those who are good and wealthy among you swear not to help their kinsmen, those in need and those who left their homes in Allahs Cause. Let them forgive and overlook. Do you not wish that Allah should forgive you? Verily! Allah is Oft-forgiving, Most Merciful.\" (24.22) After that Abu Bakr said, Yes ! By Allah! I like that Allah should forgive me, and resumed helping Mistah whom he used to help before. Allahs Apostle also asked Zainab bint Jahsh (i.e. the Prophets wife about me saying, What do you know and what did you see? She replied, O Allahs Apostle! I refrain to claim hearing or seeing what I have not heard or seen. By Allah, I know nothing except goodness about Aisha.\" Aisha further added \"Zainab was competing with me (in her beauty and the Prophets love), yet Allah protected her (from being malicious), for she had piety.\"<D>And from his narration on the authority of Ibn Abbas that he said regarding the interpretation of Allahs saying (Those who disbelieve): (Those who disbelieve) in Muhammad (pbuh) and the Quran (and turn (men) from the way of Allah) and prevent people from the religion and obedience of Allah-the reference here is to those who fed the army of the disbelievers on the Day of Badr: Utbah and Shaybah the sons of Rabiah, Munbih and Nabih the sons of al-Hajjaj, Abul-Buhturi Ibn Hisham and Abu Jahl Ibn Hisham and their host-, (He rendereth their actions vain) He thwarts their good deeds and spending on the Day of Badr.<D>((And it was said unto him): O David! Lo! We have set thee as a vicegerent in the earth) We appointed you a prophet king for the Children of Israel; (therefore judge aright between mankind) judge justly between people, (and follow not desire) that as you did regarding Bathseba, the wife of Uriah, who was also Davids cousin (that it beguile thee from the way of Allah) from the obedience of Allah. (Lo! those who wander from the way of Allah) from the obedience of Allah (have an awful doom, forasmuch as they forgot the Day of Reckoning) because they forsake working for the Day of Reckoning.<D>Salih said to them: (Tomorrow) on the Day of Judgement (they will know who is the rash liar) who is the vain liar who lies against Allah.", "Generated_Answer": "Assalamu alaykum dear brother,\n\nThank you for reaching out and sharing this deeply personal struggle. It takes courage to confront such emotional pain, especially from those we consider brothers in faith. Your commitment to practicing Islam and strengthening your deen is truly praiseworthy—may Allah ﷻ increase you in guidance and grant you steadfastness.\n\n### **1. Understanding the Pain: Validating Your Feelings**\nWhat you’re experiencing—betrayal, judgment, and hurt from fellow Muslims—is profoundly painful. The Prophet ﷺ emphasized the sanctity of a Muslim’s heart and dignity:  \n> **\"A Muslim is the brother of another Muslim. He does not wrong him, nor surrender him...\"** (Sahih Muslim 2564).  \n\nWhen those we trust violate this bond, it shakes our sense of belonging. Your feelings of depression and hurt are valid. Islam acknowledges emotional wounds and urges us to address them with wisdom, not suppression.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Islam’s Severe Condemnation of Backbiting (Ghibah)**\nAllah ﷻ says in the Qur’an:  \n> **\"And do not backbite one another. Would any of you like to eat the flesh of his dead brother? You would detest it!\"** (Qur’an 49:12).  \n\nThe Prophet ﷺ defined backbiting as **\"mentioning your brother in a way he dislikes\"** (Sahih Muslim 2589). Criticizing your appearance, speech, or mannerisms—in your absence—falls squarely under this prohibition. Those engaging in this sin are not only harming you but also burdening their own souls. Remind yourself: **Their words say more about their spiritual state than yours.**\n\n---\n\n### **3. Practical Steps to Navigate This Trial**\n#### **A. Self-Reflection (Muhasabah)**\n- Ask yourself: **Is there any truth to their criticisms?** If yes (e.g., your attire *could* be improved to better align with modesty), use it as a chance to grow. If not—recognize it as baseless noise.  \n- **Ignore the malice, not the lesson.** As Imam al-Ghazali said, *\"Take the truth even from the tongue of a liar.\"*  \n\n#### **B. Kind Confrontation (Advice with Wisdom)**\n- **Approach the brother privately** with gentleness and sincerity:  \n  *\"Brother, I’ve heard you’ve shared concerns about me. If I’ve wronged you, let’s resolve it. If not, let’s avoid harming each other’s honor.\"*  \n  This follows the Qur’anic command:  \n  > **\"Repel evil with what is better, and suddenly the one you had enmity with becomes like a close friend\"** (Qur’an 41:34).  \n\n- If he denies or reacts poorly, **forgive him inwardly** and limit interactions. The Prophet ﷺ said:  \n  > **\"Be tolerant, and you will receive tolerance. Forgive, and Allah will forgive you\"** (Musnad Ahmad 6803).  \n\n#### **C. Protect Your Heart with Forgiveness**\n- **Forgive them for Allah’s sake—even if they never apologize.** Holding resentment only harms *you*. Allah ﷻ says:  \n  > **\"Let them pardon and overlook. Do you not love that Allah should forgive you?\"** (Qur’an 24:22).  \n\n#### **D. Turn to Allah in Du’a**\n- Pray with raw honesty:  \n  *\"O Allah, soothe my heart, shield me from malice, and guide those who wronged me. Elevate me beyond needing their validation.\"*  \n  The Prophet ﷺ taught us:  \n  > **\"Du’a is the weapon of the believer\"** (Al-Hakim).  \n\n#### **E. Distance with Dignity**\n- If their toxicity persists, **limit contact respectfully**. The Prophet ﷺ said:  \n  > **\"A person is upon the religion of their close friend, so be mindful of whom you befriend\"** (Sunan Abi Dawud 4833).  \n  Surround yourself with brothers who uplift your iman, not undermine it.\n\n#### **F. Focus on Your Relationship with Allah**\n- Remember: **Allah sees your sincerity**, while people see only surfaces. Your worth isn’t defined by their gossip—it’s defined by your taqwa.  \n- **Transform pain into worship**: Channel this hurt into deeper devotion (e.g., night prayers, Qur’an recitation). The Prophet ﷺ said:  \n  > **\"Wonderful is the affair of the believer... If he is harmed by hardship, he is patient, and that is good for him\"** (Sahih Muslim 2999).  \n\n---\n\n### **4. The Bigger Picture: Rising Above**\nJudging others based on outward traits contradicts the Sunnah. The Prophet ﷺ warned:  \n> **\"Allah does not look at your appearances or wealth, but at your hearts and deeds\"** (Sahih Muslim 2564).  \n\nTheir behavior reflects a spiritual disease (hasad/envy) or insecurity—issues *they* must resolve. Your role isn’t to fix them but to guard your heart, maintain integrity, and let your actions silence their tongues.  \n\n---\n\n### **Final Counsel**\nBrother, this test is an opportunity for immense ajr (reward). Endure it with sabr, knowing Allah ﷻ elevates those unjustly wronged. The Prophet ﷺ endured far worse from his own kin, yet responded:  \n> **\"O Allah, forgive my people, for they do not know\"** (Sahih al-Bukhari 3290).  \n\nStay true to your path. The believers who matter will recognize your sincerity—and those who don’t, will fade into irrelevance.  \n\nMay Allah heal your heart, protect you from malice, and replace this pain with unshakable closeness to Him. Ameen.  \n\nWith prayers for your strength,  \nShaykh Ilyas Patel"}
{"Question": "Q: Is chewing gum halaal or haraam? I have come to know that chewing gum is made up of pig fat. So I want to know from you that what is the Islamic ruling on this? ? --T--", "Answer": "The principle of Shariah is that if the ingredients contained in any food product is from impure or impermissible substance, then consuming such a food product will be impermissible. We are not a Halaal certifying body and do not supervise products of any company or outlet, hence we are not in a position to issue a specific ruling regarding any product. You may refer to any halaal certifying body. And Allah Taala ( ) knows best", "Document": "‘A’ishah said :The Messenger of Allah() liked sweet meats and honey. The narrator then mentioned a part of the tradition mentioned above. The Messenger of Allah () felt it hard on him to find smell from him. In this tradition saudah said: but you ate gum ? He said : No, I drank honey. Hafsah gave it to me to drank. I said : Its bees ate ‘urfut.Abu Dawud said: Maghafir is a gum ; jarasat means ate; ’urfut is a bees ‘ plant.<D>Narrated Aisha:The first child who was born in the Islamic Land (i.e. Medina) amongst the Emigrants, was `Abdullah bin Az-Zubair.

", "Generated_Answer": "**Answer:**\n\nThe permissibility (halal) or prohibition (haram) of chewing gum in Islam depends on its ingredients. Here’s a detailed breakdown:\n\n### 1. **Pig Fat (Porcine Ingredients):**\n   - If chewing gum contains **pig-derived ingredients** (e.g., pork gelatin or pig fat), it is strictly **haram** (forbidden) according to Islamic law (Quran 2:173, 6:145).  \n   - **However**, most modern chewing gums **do not use animal fats** as primary ingredients. Instead, they often rely on synthetic or plant-based materials (e.g., gum base made from polymers, resins, or natural latex).\n\n### 2. **Common Ingredients in Chewing Gum:**\n   - **Gum Base**: Traditionally derived from chicle (a plant-based sap), but today it is mostly synthetic or uses halal-friendly ingredients like beeswax or vegetable oils.  \n   - **Sweeteners**: Sugar or artificial sweeteners (halal unless contaminated).  \n   - **Flavorings and Softeners**: Usually plant-based (e.g., glycerin from vegetable oil).  \n   - **Gelatin**: If used, gelatin must be sourced from halal-slaughtered animals or plants. **Avoid gelatin derived from pigs or non-halal animals**.\n\n### 3. **Key Islamic Rulings:**\n   - **Halal**: If the gum contains **no haram ingredients** (e.g., pork derivatives, alcohol-based flavorings) and all components are halal-certified or verified.  \n   - **Haram**: If it contains **pork fat/gelatin**, non-halal animal products, or intoxicants (e.g., alcohol in flavorings).  \n   - **Doubtful Ingredients**: If unsure, avoid it until verified (Quran 5:3; Hadith on avoiding doubtful matters).\n\n### 4. **Practical Steps for Muslims:**\n   - **Check Ingredients**: Look for labels like \"gelatin-free,\" \"vegetarian,\" or \"plant-based.\"  \n   - **Halal Certification**: Opt for gums certified by reputable halal authorities (e.g., ISNA, JAKIM, HALAL Trust).  \n   - **Avoid Uncertainty**: If the ingredients are unclear or not halal-certified, err on the side of caution.\n\n### 5. **Fatwa from Scholars:**\n   - Most contemporary scholars (e.g., Islamic Fiqh Council) permit chewing gum if halal ingredients are confirmed. For example, brands like **Vegan Glee Gum** or **Simply Gum** use plant-based ingredients and are halal-friendly.  \n\n### Conclusion:\nChewing gum is **halal** if it is free from haram substances. **Pig fat is not a standard ingredient in most commercial gums today**, but always verify the source of gelatin or other additives. If in doubt, choose halal-certified products or consult a trusted Islamic scholar.\n\n*Always prioritize transparency in consumption and seek knowledge before using any product.*"}
{"Question": "I read somewhere that the Beloved Prophet (peace be upon him) used to put oil in his hair, so much so that his clothes/turban would become oily. Was this olive oil that he used? If one rubs olive oil into the hair and scalp for its healthy benefit, is doing wudu over oil-covered hair, and subsequent salat valid? ? --T--", "Answer": "Assalamu alaykum Oil normally soaks very quickly into the hair and becomes absorbed through the scalp. It does not necessarily coat the hair. In dry climates, many people apply oil their hair to protect it from dryness and to gain some coolness. The oil penetrates the hair and scalp and disappears quickly. Therefore, it is permissible to make masah (pass a wetted hand) over oiled hair, unless an excessive amount has been used, in which case one can wait for a short while before making wudu or perform wudu before applying the oil. The Messenger of Allah (upon him be peace) has recommended the use of olive oil, both in cooking and in applying to the body and hair (Shamail Tirmidhi). Shaykh Zakariyya Kandhlawi, in his commentary on this hadith, states that the Messengers (upon him be peace) recommending it means that he possibly used it himself. ", "Document": "Urwa b. Zubair reported on the authority of Aisha, the wife of Allahs Apostle (may peace be upon him), that she said:Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) died (in a state) that it never happened that he could eat to his fill the bread with olive oil twice during a day.<D>It wasnarrated from Ibn ‘Umar that the Prophet () used to put oilonhis head when he was in the state of Ihram, but not oil that wasperfumed.<D>Qatadah narrated from Abu Abdullah that Zaid bin Arqam said:\"The Prophet (S.A.W) would acclaim oil and Wars for (the treatment of) pleurisy.\" Qatadah said: \"And it is put in the mouth on the side which he is suffering. \"<D>Allah then mentioned the honour and blessings that He had bestowed upon the believers, saying: (Allah is the Light of the heavens and the earth) He is the guide of the dwellers of the heaves and earth. Guidance from Allah is of two types: clarification and making things known; it is also said that the verse means: Allah is the embellisher of the heavens by means of the stars and the embellisher of the earth by means of plants and water; it is also said that this means: Allah enlightens the hearts of the believers among the dwellers of the heavens and the earth. (The similitude of His light) the light of the believers; it is also said that this means: the light of Allah in the heart of the believer (is as a niche wherein is a lamp. The lamp is in a glass) made of gems. (The glass is as it were a shining star) one of the following five planets: Mercury, Jupiter, Venus, Mars and Saturn. All these planets are luminous. ((This lamp is) kindled from a blessed tree) from the oil of a blessed tree, (an olive neither of the East nor of the West) in an open space, not touched by the shade of the East nor by the shade of the West; it is also said that this means: in a location which isuntouched by the sun when it rises and when it sets, (whose oil) the oil of the tree (would almost glow forth(of itself)) from behind its rind (though no fire touched it. Light upon light) the lamp emits light and the glass emits light and the oil emits light, (Allah guideth unto His light) Allah honours with knowledge; it isalso said that this means: Allah honours with His religion (whom He will) whoever deserves it; it is also said that the verse means: the likeness of the light of Muhammad in the loins of his forefathers is like this, up to Allahs saying ( kindled from a blessed tree). He says: the light of Muhammad in Abraham was an upright religion (olive tree), and Abraham was neither Jew nor Christian (neither of the East nor of the West), the works of Abraham would almost glow forth in the loins of his forefathers like this (would almost glow forth (of itself)), up until Allahs saying (kindled from a blessed tree) He says: as if it is the light of Muhammad (pbuh) and if Abraham was not a prophet, he would still have this light (though no fire touched it); it is also said that the latter passage means: Had Allah not honoured Abraham, he would not have had this light; it is also said: if Allah had not honoured His believing servant with this light, he would not have had it. (AndAllah speaketh to mankind in allegories) in this way does Allah show to people the trait of knowledge, (for Allah is knower of all things) regarding the honour He bestows upon His servants. Allah struck this similitude of knowledge and clarified its benefit and its praiseworthiness in order that they give thanks to it. Allah says here that just as one uses a lamp to find his way in the dark, so is the light of knowledge used for ones guidance; and just as one uses the stars and planets to find ones way in the darkness of the seas and land, one also uses the light of knowledge for guidance in the darkness of disbelief and idolatry; and just as theoil of a lamp is taken from the blessed olive tree, so too is knowledge from Allah, Exalted is He, for His servant; and just as the olive tree is neither from the East nor from the West, so too is the believer an upright Muslim, neither Jew nor Christian; and just as the oil of the olive tree would almost glow forth of itself even when no fire touches it, so too the faith of the believer is praiseworthy even when there are no virtuous works to accompany it; and just as the niche and the glass and the lamp are light upon light, so too is knowledge light, and the heart of the believer is light and his chest is light and his incoming is light andhis outgoing is light: light upon light; and Allah honours with this light whomever He wills.

Did the Prophet (PBUH) use olive oil for his hair?**\nSeveral authentic *ahadith* confirm that the Prophet (PBUH) used oil in his hair, and olive oil (*zayt*) is explicitly mentioned as one of the oils he used:\n- **عَنْ أَبِي هُرَيْرَةَ قَالَ: كَانَ رَسُولُ اللَّهِ صَلَّى اللَّهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّمَ إِذَا ادَّهَنَ يَبْدَأُ بِرَأْسِهِ فَيُصِيبُ الدَّهْنَ لِحْيَتَهُ مِنْ فَضْلِ يَدِهِ**  \n  *Abu Huraira (رضي الله عنه) reported: \"When the Messenger of Allah (PBUH) applied oil (to his hair), he began with his head, and the oil would reach his beard from the excess on his hand.\"*  \n  **(Sunan Abi Dawud 4175 - graded *hasan* by Albani)**  \n\n- **عَنْ عَائِشَةَ قَالَتْ: كَانَ رَسُولُ اللَّهِ صَلَّى اللَّهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّمَ يُحِبُّ التَّيَمُّنَ فِي طُهُورِهِ إِذَا تَطَهَّرَ وَفِي تَرَجُّلِهِ إِذَا تَرَجَّلَ وَفِي انْتِعَالِهِ إِذَا انْتَعَلَ**  \n  *Aisha (رضي الله عنها) said: \"The Messenger of Allah (PBUH) loved to start with the right in his purification, combing his hair, and putting on his sandals.\"*  \n  **(Sahih al-Bukhari 168)**  \n  *This indicates his attention to grooming, including oiling his hair.*\n\n- **Olive oil in particular**: The Prophet (PBUH) praised olive oil for both consumption and topical use:  \n  **كُلُوا الزَّيْتَ وَادَّهِنُوا بِهِ فَإِنَّهُ مِنْ شَجَرَةٍ مُبَارَكَةٍ**  \n  *\"Eat olive oil and apply it (topically), for it is from a blessed tree.\"*  \n  **(Sunan al-Tirmidhi 1851 - graded *hasan* by Tirmidhi)**  \n\nThus, it is well-established that he used olive oil for hair care, and his hair would sometimes leave oil stains on his clothes or turban (*imamah*), as mentioned in some narrations.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Is wudu valid if the hair/scalp is covered with oil?**\nApplying oil to the hair or scalp **does not invalidate wudu** or prayer (*salah*), according to the majority of scholars. Here’s why:\n- **Wudu only requires *masḥ* (wiping) over the hair, not washing**:  \n  The obligation in wudu is to wipe *over* the head (Quran 5:6), not necessarily to wash the scalp or remove substances like oil. As long as water touches the hair (even if oil is present), the requirement is fulfilled.\n- **Oil does not create a barrier (*ḥājiz*)**:  \n  Islamic jurisprudence distinguishes between substances that *prevent water from reaching the skin* (e.g., wax, glue) and those that merely coat it (e.g., oil, cream). Oil is permeable, and water can still reach the hair/skin beneath it. Thus, it does not nullify wudu.\n- **Scholarly consensus**:  \n  The Hanafi, Maliki, and Hanbali schools explicitly state that wudu is valid even if oil is present on the hair or scalp. The Shafi'i school holds a stricter view but still permits it if the oil is minimal and water can penetrate it"}

(So learn a lesson, O ye who have eyes!) learn a lesson, O you who have insight in Religion, from what Allah has done to them concerning their exile.", "Generated_Answer": "I understand your concerns for the safety of your children and household, and the distress caused by the stray dogs’ presence. However, poisoning or killing the dogs is **not permissible in Islam** — nor is it legal or ethical — except as an absolute last resort when all other options have been exhausted and there is a clear, immediate threat to human life. The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) emphasized mercy toward animals, stating: *\"A woman was punished because she imprisoned a cat until it died. She entered Hellfire because of it...\"* (Sahih Bukhari). Even when dealing with harmful animals, Islam requires proportionality, necessity, and avoiding undue suffering.\n\nHere are Islamically grounded and practical steps to resolve this issue:\n\n---\n\n### **1. Re-engage Authorities with Urgency**\n   - **Report the bite incident formally**: Document the attack on your maid (maasi) with local police, municipal authorities, or animal control. A dog bite is a public health risk (rabies concerns) and should prompt action. Provide medical records if possible.\n   - **Follow up persistently**: Escalate to higher authorities if local offices are unresponsive. Involve elected representatives or community leaders to pressure officials.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Seek Mediation with Your Neighbors**\n   - **Discuss respectfully**: Explain your fears for your children and the biting incident. They may not realize the consequences of feeding strays near your home. Suggest alternative ways they can help (e.g., supporting a shelter).\n   - **Involve community leaders**: If direct talks fail, ask an imam, elder, or local council to mediate. Islam encourages resolving disputes through dialogue (Quran 49:9–10).\n\n---\n\n### **3. Use Humane Deterrents**\n   - **Secure your property**: Install fences, gates, or motion-activated lights/sprinklers to keep dogs away from your door.\n   - **Natural repellents**: Scatter citrus peels, chili powder, or vinegar near entry points—these are harmless but discourage dogs.\n   - **Avoid feeding zones**: Ensure no food waste or water sources attract them to your area.\n\n---\n\n### **4. Collaborate with Animal Welfare Groups**\n   - Contact local NGOs or shelters to safely relocate the dogs, especially the puppies (who are more adaptable). Many organizations offer **free sterilization/vaccination programs** to control stray populations humanely.\n   - In some regions, groups like **Brotherhood for Animals** (Islamic animal welfare initiatives) can assist.\n\n---\n\n### **5. Islamic Perspective on Killing Animals**\n   - Killing is only justified if a dog is **rabid or actively attacking** (Sahih Muslim). General nuisance or fear does not permit poisoning, which causes extreme suffering and violates Islamic principles of avoiding *zulm* (injustice) to creation.\n   - The Quran warns against letting hatred lead to injustice (5:8). Even if your neighbors acted wrongly, respond with wisdom and patience.\n\n---\n\n### **6. Legal and Ethical Risks of Poisoning**\n   - Poisoning is illegal in most countries and punishable by fines or imprisonment.\n   - It risks harming children, other animals, or even your neighbors, escalating conflict.\n   - Stray puppies are innocent; killing them violates the Prophet’s emphasis on protecting young life.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Advice**\nPrioritize **protection without cruelty**: Secure your home, document threats, and persist with authorities. If the dogs are truly aggressive, demand that professionals handle them safely. Allah rewards patience and sincere efforts to resolve harm without compromising mercy. May He protect your family and guide you to a solution that upholds justice for all."}

(Quran 24:31) This is why Muslim women cover their heads: because the Quran unambiguously orders them to, and there is no qualifying text or hadith or even other lexical possibility to show that the Quranic order might mean anything besides obligation. Rather, the hadiths all bear this meaning out, Muslim scholars are in unanimous agreement about it and have been from the time of the Prophet (Allah bless him and give him peace) down to our own day, and it is even known by all non-Muslim peoples about them . Please see the following links related to your question about wearing hijab: Why Hijab?By Shaykh Nuh Ha Mim KellerThe Islamic Veil or Hijabjannah", "Document": "Narrated Aisha:(The wife of the Prophet) Whenever Allahs Apostle intended to go on a journey, he used to draw lots among his wives and would take with him the one on whom the lot had fallen. Once he drew lots when he wanted to carry out a Ghazwa, and the lot came upon me. So I proceeded with Allahs Apostle after Allahs order of veiling (the women) had been revealed and thus I was carried in my howdah (on a camel) and dismounted while still in it. We carried on our journey, and when Allahs Apostle had finished his Ghazwa and returned and we approached Medina, Allahs Apostle ordered to proceed at night. When the army was ordered to resume the homeward journey, I got up and walked on till I left the army (camp) behind. When I had answered the call of nature, I went towards my howdah, but behold ! A necklace of mine made of Jaz Azfar (a kind of black bead) was broken and I looked for it and my search for it detained me. The group of people who used to carry me, came and carried my howdah on to the back of my camel on which I was riding, considering that I was therein. At that time women were light in weight and were not fleshy for they used to eat little (food), so those people did not feel the lightness of the howdah while raising it up, and I was still a young lady. They drove away the camel and proceeded. Then I found my necklace after the army had gone. I came to their camp but found nobody therein so I went to the place where I used to stay, thinking that they would miss me and come back in my search. While I was sitting at my place, I felt sleepy and slept. Safwan bin Al-Muattil As-Sulami Adh- Dhakw-ani was behind the army. He had started in the last part of the night and reached my stationing place in the morning and saw the figure of a sleeping person. He came to me and recognized me on seeing me for he used to see me before veiling. I got up because of his saying: \"Inna Li l-lahi wa inna ilaihi rajiun,\" which he uttered on recognizing me. I covered my face with my garment, and by Allah, he did not say to me a single word except, \"Inna Li l-lahi wa inna ilaihi rajiun,\" till he made his shecamel kneel down whereupon he trod on its forelegs and I mounted it. Then Safwan set out, leading the she-camel that was carrying me, till we met the army while they were resting during the hot midday. Then whoever was meant for destruction, fell in destruction, and the leader of the Ifk (forged statement) was `Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul. After this we arrived at Medina and I became ill for one month while the people were spreading the forged statements of the people of the Ifk, and I was not aware of anything thereof. But what aroused my doubt while I was sick, was that I was no longer receiving from Allahs Apostle the same kindness as I used to receive when I fell sick. Allahs Apostle would enter upon me, say a greeting and add, \"How is that (lady)?\" and then depart. That aroused my suspicion but I was not aware of the propagated evil till I recovered from my ailment. I went out with Um Mistah to answer the call of nature towards Al-Manasi, the place where we used to relieve ourselves, and used not to go out for this purpose except from night to night, and that was before we had lavatories close to our houses. And this habit of ours was similar to the habit of the old Arabs (in the deserts or in the tents) concerning the evacuation of the bowels, for we considered it troublesome and harmful to take lavatories in the houses. So I went out with Um Mistah who was the daughter of Abi Ruhm bin `Abd Manaf, and her mother was daughter of Sakhr bin Amir who was the aunt of Abi Bakr As-Siddiq, and her son was Mistah bin Uthatha. When we had finished our affair, Um Mistah and I came back towards my house. Um Mistah stumbled over her robe whereupon she said, \"Let Mistah be ruined ! \" I said to her, \"What a bad word you have said! Do you abuse a man who has taken part in the Battle of Badr? She said, \"O you there! Didnt you hear what he has said?\" I said, \"And what did he say?\" She then told me the statement of the people of the Ifk (forged statement) which added to my ailment. When I returned home, Allahs Apostle came to me, and after greeting, he said, \"How is that (lady)?\" I said, \"Will you allow me to go to my parents?\" At that time I intended to be sure of the news through them. Allahs Apostle allowed me and I went to my parents and asked my mother, \"O my mother! What are the people talking about?\" My mother said, \"O my daughter! Take it easy, for by Allah, there is no charming lady who is loved by her husband who has other wives as well, but that those wives would find fault with her.\" I said, \"Subhan Allah! Did the people really talk about that?\" That night I kept on weeping the whole night till the morning. My tears never stopped, nor did I sleep, and morning broke while I was still weeping, Allahs Apostle called `Ali bin Abi Talib and Usama bin Zaid when the Divine Inspiration delayed, in order to consult them as to the idea of divorcing his wife. Usama bin Zaid told Allahs Apostle of what he knew about the innocence of his wife and of his affection he kept for her. He said, \"O Allahs Apostle! She is your wife, and we do not know anything about her except good.\" But `Ali bin Abi Talib said, \"O Allahs Apostle! Allah does not impose restrictions on you; and there are plenty of women other than her. If you however, ask (her) slave girl, she will tell you the truth.\" `Aisha added: So Allahs Apostle called for Barira and said, \"O Barira! Did you ever see anything which might have aroused your suspicion? (as regards Aisha). Barira said, \"By Allah Who has sent you with the truth, I have never seen anything regarding Aisha which I would blame her for except that she is a girl of immature age who sometimes sleeps and leaves the dough of her family unprotected so that the domestic goats come and eat it.\" So Allahs Apostle got up (and addressed) the people an asked for somebody who would take revenge on `Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul then. Allahs Apostle, while on the pulpit, said, \"O Muslims! Who will help me against a man who has hurt me by slandering my family? By Allah, I know nothing except good about my family, and people have blamed a man of whom I know nothing except good, and he never used to visit my family except with me,\" Sa`d bin Mu`adh Al-Ansari got up and said, \"O Allahs Apostle! By Allah, I will relieve you from him. If he be from the tribe of (Bani) Al-Aus, then I will chop his head off; and if he be from our brethren, the Khazraj, then you give us your order and we will obey it.\" On that, Sa`d bin Ubada got up, and he was the chief of the Khazraj, and before this incident he had been a pious man but he was incited by his zeal for his tribe. He said to Sa`d (bin Mu`adh), \"By Allah the Eternal, you have told a lie! You shall not kill him and you will never be able to kill him!\" On that, Usaid bin Hudair, the cousin of Sa`d (bin Mu`adh) got up and said to Sa`d bin Ubada, \"You are a liar! By Allah the Eternal, we will surely kill him; and you are a hypocrite defending the hypocrites!\" So the two tribes of Al-Aus and Al-Khazraj got excited till they were on the point of fighting with each other while Allahs Apostle was standing on the pulpit. Allahs Apostle continued quietening them till they became silent whereupon he became silent too. On that day I kept on weeping so much that neither did my tears stop, nor could I sleep. In the morning my parents were with me, and I had wept for two nights and a day without sleeping and with incessant tears till they thought that my liver would burst with weeping. While they were with me and I was weeping, an Ansari woman asked permission to see me. I admitted her and she sat and started weeping with me. While I was in that state, Allahs Apostle came to us, greeted, and sat down,. He had never sat with me since the day what was said, was said. He had stayed a month without receiving any Divine Inspiration concerning my case. Allahs Apostle recited the Tashahhud after he had sat down, and then said, \"Thereafter, O `Aisha! I have been informed such and-such a thing about you; and if you are innocent, Allah will reveal your innocence, and if you have committed a sin, then ask for Allahs forgiveness and repent to Him, for when a slave confesses his sin and then repents to Allah, Allah accepts his repentance.\" When Allahs Apostle had finished his speech, my tears ceased completely so that I no longer felt even a drop thereof. Then I said to my father, \"Reply to Allahs Apostle on my behalf as to what he said.\" He said, \"By Allah, I do not know what to say to Allahs Apostle.\" Then I said to my mother, \"Reply to Allahs Apostle.\" She said, \"I do not know what to say to Allahs Apostle.\" Still a young girl as I was and though I had little knowledge of Quran, I said, \"By Allah, I know that you heard this story (of the Ifk) so much so that it has been planted in your minds and you have believed it. So now, if I tell you that I am innocent, and Allah knows that I am innocent, you will not believe me; and if I confess something, and Allah knows that I am innocent of it, you will believe me. By Allah, I cannot find of you an example except that of Josephs father: \"So (for me) patience is most fitting against that which you assert and it is Allah (Alone) Whose help can be sought. Then I turned away and lay on my bed, and at that time I knew that I was innocent and that Allah would reveal my innocence. But by Allah, I never thought that Allah would sent down about my affair, Divine Inspiration that would be recited (forever), as I considered myself too unworthy to be talked of by Allah with something that was to be recited: but I hoped that Allahs Apostle might have a vision in which Allah would prove my innocence. By Allah, Allahs Apostle had not left his seat and nobody had left the house when the Divine Inspiration came to Allahs Apostle . So there overtook him the same hard condition which used to overtake him (when he was Divinely Inspired) so that the drops of his sweat were running down, like pearls, though it was a (cold) winter day, and that was because of the heaviness of the Statement which was revealed to him. When that state of Allahs Apostle was over, and he was smiling when he was relieved, the first word he said was, \"Aisha, Allah has declared your innocence.\" My mother said to me, \"Get up and go to him.\" I said, \"By Allah, I will not go to him and I will not thank anybody but Allah.\" So Allah revealed: \"Verily! They who spread the Slander are a gang among you. Think it not....\" (24.11-20). When Allah revealed this to confirm my innocence, Abu Bakr As-Siddiq who used to provide for Mistah bin Uthatha because of the latters kinship to him and his poverty, said, \"By Allah, I will never provide for Mistah anything after what he has said about Aisha\". So Allah revealed: (continued...) (continuing... 1): -6.274:... ... \"Let not those among you who are good and are wealthy swear not to give (help) to their kinsmen, those in need, and those who have left their homes for Allahs Cause. Let them Pardon and forgive (i.e. do not punish them). Do you not love that should forgive you? Verily Allah is Oft-forgiving. Most Merciful.\" (24.22) Abu Bakr said, \"Yes, by Allah, I wish that Allah should forgive me.\" So he resumed giving Mistah the aid he used to give him before and said, \"By Allah, I will never withold it from him at all.\" Aisha further said: Allahs Apostle also asked Zainab bint Jahsh about my case. He said, \"O Zainab! What have you seen?\" She replied, \"O Allahs Apostle! I protect my hearing and my sight (by refraining from telling lies). I know nothing but good (about Aisha).\" Of all the wives of Allahs Apostle, it was Zainab who aspired to receive from him the same favor as I used to receive, yet, Allah saved her (from telling lies) because of her piety. But her sister, Hamna, kept on fighting on her behalf so she was destroyed as were those who invented and spread the slander.<D>Narrated Aisha:(the wife of the Prophet) \"Whenever Allahs Apostle intended to go on a journey, he would draw lots amongst his wives and would take with him the one upon whom the lot fell. During a Ghazwa of his, he drew lots amongst us and the lot fell upon me, and I proceeded with him after Allah had decreed the use of the veil by women. I was carried in a Howdah (on the camel) and dismounted while still in it. When Allahs Apostle was through with his Ghazwa and returned home, and we approached the city of Medina, Allahs Apostle ordered us to proceed at night. When the order of setting off was given, I walked till I was past the army to answer the call of nature. After finishing I returned (to the camp) to depart (with the others) and suddenly realized that my necklace over my chest was missing. So, I returned to look for it and was delayed because of that. The people who used to carry me on the camel, came to my Howdah and put it on the back of the camel, thinking that I was in it, as, at that time, women were light in weight, and thin and lean, and did not use to eat much. So, those people did not feel the difference in the heaviness of the Howdah while lifting it, and they put it over the camel. At that time I was a young lady. They set the camel moving and proceeded on. I found my necklace after the army had gone, and came to their camp to find nobody. So, I went to the place where I used to stay, thinking that they would discover my absence and come back in my search. While in that state, I felt sleepy and slept. Safwan bin Muattal As-Sulami Adh-Dhakwani was behind the army and reached my abode in the morning. When he saw a sleeping person, he came to me, and he used to see me before veiling. So, I got up when I heard him saying, \"Inna lil-lah-wa inn a ilaihi rajiun (We are for Allah, and we will return to Him).\" He made his camel knell down. He got down from his camel, and put his leg on the front legs of the camel and then I rode and sat over it. Safwan set out walking, leading the camel by the rope till we reached the army who had halted to take rest at midday. Then whoever was meant for destruction, fell into destruction, (some people accused me falsely) and the leader of the false accusers was `Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul. After that we returned to Medina, and I became ill for one month while the people were spreading the forged statements of the false accusers. I was feeling during my ailment as if I were not receiving the usual kindness from the Prophet which I used to receive from him when I got sick. But he would come, greet and say, How is that (girl)? I did not know anything of what was going on till I recovered from my ailment and went out with Um Mistah to the Manasi where we used to answer the call of nature, and we used not to go to answer the call of nature except from night to night and that was before we had lavatories near to our houses. And this habit of ours was similar to the habit of the old Arabs in the open country (or away from houses). So. I and Um Mistah bint Ruhm went out walking. Um Mistah stumbled because of her long dress and on that she said, Let Mistah be ruined. I said, You are saying a bad word. Why are you abusing a man who took part in (the battle of) Badr? She said, O Hanata (you there) didnt you hear what they said? Then she told me the rumors of the false accusers. My sickness was aggravated, and when I returned home, Allahs Apostle came to me, and after greeting he said, How is that (girl)? I requested him to allow me to go to my parents. I wanted then to be sure of the news through them I Allahs Apostle allowed me, and I went to my parents and asked my mother, What are the people talking about? She said, O my daughter! Dont worry much about this matter. By Allah, never is there a charming woman loved by her husband who has other wives, but the women would forge false news about her. I said, Glorified be Allah! Are the people really taking of this matter? That night I kept on weeping and could not sleep till morning. In the morning Allahs Apostle called `Ali bin Abu Talib and Usama bin Zaid when he saw the Divine Inspiration delayed, to consul them about divorcing his wife (i.e. `Aisha). Usama bin Zaid said what he knew of the good reputation of his wives and added, O Allahs Apostle! Keep you wife, for, by Allah, we know nothing about her but good. `Ali bin Abu Talib said, O Allahs Apostle! Allah has no imposed restrictions on you, and there are many women other than she, yet you may ask the woman-servant who will tell you the truth. On that Allahs Apostle called Buraira and said, O Burair. Did you ever see anything which roused your suspicions about her? Buraira said, No, by Allah Who has sent you with the Truth, I have never seen in her anything faulty except that she is a girl of immature age, who sometimes sleeps and leaves the dough for the goats to eat. On that day Allahs Apostle ascended the pulpit and requested that somebody support him in punishing `Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul. Allahs Apostle said, Who will support me to punish that person (`Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul) who has hurt me by slandering the reputation of my family? By Allah, I know nothing about my family but good, and they have accused a person about whom I know nothing except good, and he never entered my house except in my company. Sa`d bin Mu`adh got up and said, O Allahs Apostle! by Allah, I will relieve you from him. If that man is from the tribe of the Aus, then we will chop his head off, and if he is from our brothers, the Khazraj, then order us, and we will fulfill your order. On that Sa`d bin Ubada, the chief of the Khazraj and before this incident, he had been a pious man, got up, motivated by his zeal for his tribe and said, By Allah, you have told a lie; you cannot kill him, and you will never be able to kill him. On that Usaid bin Al-Hadir got up and said (to Sa`d bin Ubada), By Allah! you are a liar. By Allah, we will kill him; and you are a hypocrite, defending the hypocrites. On this the two tribes of Aus and Khazraj got excited and were about to fight each other, while Allahs Apostle was standing on the pulpit. He got down and quieted them till they became silent and he kept quiet. On that day I kept on weeping so much so that neither did my tears stop, nor could I sleep. In the morning my parents were with me and I had wept for two nights and a day, till I thought my liver would burst from weeping. While they were sitting with me and I was weeping, an Ansari woman asked my permission to enter, and I allowed her to come in. She sat down and started weeping with me. While we were in this state, Allahs Apostle came and sat down and he had never sat with me since the day they forged the accusation. No revelation regarding my case came to him for a month. He recited Tashah-hud (i.e. None has the right to be worshipped but Allah and Muhammad is His Apostle) and then said, O `Aisha! I have been informed such-and-such about you; if you are innocent, then Allah will soon reveal your innocence, and if you have committed a sin, then repent to Allah and ask Him to forgive you, for when a person confesses his sin and asks Allah for forgiveness, Allah accepts his repentance. When Allahs Apostle finished his speech my tears ceased completely and there remained not even a single drop of it. I requested my father to reply to Allahs Apostle on my behalf. My father said, By Allah, I do not know what to say to Allahs Apostle. I said to my mother, Talk to Allahs Apostle on my behalf. She said, By Allah, I do not know what to say to Allahs Apostle. I was a young girl and did not have much knowledge of the Quran. I said. I know, by Allah, that you have listened to what people are saying and that has been planted in your minds and you have taken it as a truth. Now, if I told you that I am innocent and Allah knows that I am innocent, you would not believe me and if I confessed to you falsely that I am guilty, and Allah knows that I am innocent you would believe me. By Allah, I dont compare my situation with you except to the situation of Josephs father (i.e. Jacob) who said, So (for me) patience is most fitting against that which you assert and it is Allah (Alone) whose help can be sought. Then I turned to the other side of my bed hoping that Allah would prove my innocence. By Allah I never thought that Allah would reveal Divine Inspiration in my case, as I considered myself too inferior to be talked of in the Holy Quran. I had hoped that Allahs Apostle might have a dream in which Allah would prove my innocence. By Allah, Allahs Apostle had not got up and nobody had left the house before the Divine Inspiration came to Allahs Apostle. So, there overtook him the same state which used to overtake him, (when he used to have, on being inspired divinely). He was sweating so much so that the drops of the sweat were dropping like pearls though it was a (cold) wintry day. When that state of Allahs Apostle was over, he was smiling and the first word he said, `Aisha! Thank Allah, for Allah has declared your innocence. My mother told me to go to Allahs Apostle . I replied, By Allah I will not go to him and will not thank but Allah. So Allah revealed: \"Verily! They who spread the slander are a gang among you . . .\" (24.11) When Allah gave the declaration of my Innocence, Abu Bakr, who used to provide for Mistah bin Uthatha for he was his relative, said, By Allah, I will never provide Mistah with anything because of what he said about Aisha. But Allah later revealed: -- \"And let not those who are good and wealthy among you swear not to help their kinsmen, those in need and those who left their homes in Allahs Cause. Let them forgive and overlook. Do you not wish that Allah should forgive you? Verily! Allah is Oft-forgiving, Most Merciful.\" (24.22) After that Abu Bakr said, Yes ! By Allah! I like that Allah should forgive me, and resumed helping Mistah whom he used to help before. Allahs Apostle also asked Zainab bint Jahsh (i.e. the Prophets wife about me saying, What do you know and what did you see? She replied, O Allahs Apostle! I refrain to claim hearing or seeing what I have not heard or seen. By Allah, I know nothing except goodness about Aisha.\" Aisha further added \"Zainab was competing with me (in her beauty and the Prophets love), yet Allah protected her (from being malicious), for she had piety.\"<D>Narrated Aishah:\"What was said about me had been said, and I myself was unaware of it, the Messenger of Allah () got up and addressed the people. He recited the Tashahhud and after praising and expressing gratitude to Allah, as He deserved, he said: To proceed: O people! Give me your opinion regarding those people who made a forged story against my wife. By Allah, I do not know anything bad about her at all. By Allah, they accused her of being with a man about whom I have never known anything bad, and he never entered my house unless I was present there, and whenever I went on a journey, he went with me. Sad bin Muadh [may Allah be pleased with him] got up and said: O Messenger of Allah ()! Allow me to chop their heads off! Then a man from Al-Khazraj, to whom the mother of Hassan bin Thabit was a relative, got up and said (to Sad): You have told a lie! By Allah, if those persons were from Al-Aws, you would not like to chop their heads. It was probable that some evil would take place between Aws and Khazraj in the Masjid while I was unaware of that. In the evening of that day, I went out for some of my needs, and Umm Mistah was accompanying me. On our return, Umm Mistah stumbled and said: Let Mistah be ruined! I said to her, O mother! Why do you abuse your son? On that Umm Mistah became silent for a while, and stumbling again, she said: Let Mistah be ruined! I said to her: O mother! Why do you abuse your son? She stumbled for the third time and said: Let Mistah be ruined! I said to her: O mother! Why do you abuse your son? Upon that she said: By Allah! I do not abuse him except because of you. I asked her: Concerning what of my affairs? So she disclosed the whole story to me. I said: Has this really happened? She replied: Yes, by Allah! I returned to my house, so astonished, that I did not know for what purpose I had gone out. Then I became sick and said to the Messenger of Allah () Send me to my fathers house. So he sent a servant with me, and when I entered the house, I found Umm Ruman downstairs, while Abu Bakr was reciting something upstairs. My mother asked: What has brought you, O daughter? She said: \"I informed her and mentioned the whole story to her, but she did not feel as I did about it. She said: O my daughter! Do not worry much about this matter, for there is never a charming lady loved by her husband who has other wives, but that they feel jealous of her and speak badly of her. But she did not feel the same about it as I did. I asked her: Does my father know about it? She said Yes. I asked: Does the Messenger of Allah () know about it too? She said Yes, the Messenger of Allah () also knows about it. Tears filled my eyes and I wept. Abu Bakr, who was reading upstairs, heard my voice, and came down asking my mother: What is the matter with her? She said: She has heard what has been said about her. On that Abu Bakr wept and said: I beseech you, by Allah, O my daughter, to go back to your home. I went back to my home, and the Messenger of Allah () had come to my house asking my maid-servant about me. The maid-servant said: By Allah! I do not know of any fault or defect in her character except that she sleeps and lets the sheep enter and eat her dough. On that, some of the Prophets Companions spoke harshly to her and said: Tell the truth to the Messenger of Allah (). Finally, they told her of the slander and she said: Subhan Allah! By Allah, I know nothing against her except what a goldsmith knows about a piece of pure gold. Then this news reached the man who was accused, and he said: Subhan Allah! By Allah, I have never uncovered the private parts of any woman. Later, that man was martyred in Allahs Cause. Then the next morning, my parents came to pay me a visit and they stayed with me until the Messenger of Allah () came to me, after he performed the Asr prayer. He came to me and while my parents were sitting around me on my right and my left. The Prophet () said the Tashahhud, praised and glorified Allah and said: Now then, O Aishah! If you have committed a bad deed, or you have wronged (yourself), then repent to Allah, as Allah accepts the repentance from His worshipers. An Ansari woman had come and was sitting near the gate. I said to the Prophet (): Isnt it improper that you speak in such a way in the presence of this lady? The Messenger of Allah () then gave a piece of advice and I turned to my father and requested him to reply to him. My father said: What should I say? Then I turned to my mother and asked her to answer him. She said: What should I say? When my parents did not reply to the Prophet (), I said the Tashahhud, praised and glorified Allah as His due, and I said: Then, by Allah! If I were to tell you that I have not done (this) and Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, is witness that I am telling the truth, that would not be of any use to me on your part, because you (people) have spoken about it and your hearts have absorbed it (as truth); and if I were to tell you that I have done this sin, and Allah knows that I have not done it, then you will say: She has confessed her guilt. By Allah! I do not see a suitable example for me and you except the example of - and I could not remember Yaqbus name - Yusufs father when he said: So patience is most fitting. And it is Allah Whose help can be sought against that which you describe (12:18). She said: \"It was at that time that Revelation came to the Messenger of Allah (), and we remained silent. Then the Revelation was over, and I noticed the signs of happiness on his face while he was wiping (the sweat) from his forehead, and saying: Have the good tidings O Aishah! Allah has revealed your innocence. At that time I was extremely angry. My parents said to me: Get up and go to him. I said: By Allah, I will not do it,and will not thank him nor either of you, but I will thank Allah, Who has revealed my innocence. You have heard (this story) but neither of you have denied it, nor have you changed it (to defend me).\" Aishah used to say: \"But as regards to Zainab bint Jahsh, Allah protected her because of her piety. She did not say anything except good (about me). But her sister, Hamnah was ruined among those who were ruined. Those who used to speak evil about me were Mistah, Hassan bin Thabit, and the hypocrite Abdullah bin Ubayy [bin Salul] and [it is he who] used to spread that news and tempt others to speak of it, and it was he and Hamnah who had the greater share therein. Abu Bakr took an oath that he would never do any favor for Mistah at all. Then Allah, Most High, revealed this Ayah: Let not those among you who are blessed with graces and wealth [until the end of the Ayah] referring to Abu Bakr: to give their kinsmen, the poor, and those who left their homes for Allahs Cause. - meaning Mistah - up to His saying: Do you not love that Allah should forgive you? And Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful (24:22). On that, Abu Bakr said: Yes, by Allah! O our Lord! We wish that You forgive us. So he returned to what he had been doing.\"<D>(He said) Jacob said: (I expose my distress and anguish only unto Allah, and I know from Allah that which ye know not) I know that Josephs vision is true and that we will prostrate to him; it is also said that this means: I know of Allahs mercy and of His good work that which you do not; it is also said that this means: I know that Joseph is alive. That is because the angel of death came to him and he asked him: \"did you take away the soul of Joseph from among those you took their souls away\". And the angel said he did not.<D>(Thus doth Allah seal the hearts of those who know not) Allahs divine Oneness and disbelieve in it. <D>(Allah hath decreed: Lo! I verily shall conquer, I and My messengers) i.e. Muhammad (pbuh) they shall conquer Persia, Byzantium, the hypocrites and the Jews. (Lo! Allah is Strong) through giving help to his prophets, (Almighty) in retribution against His enemies. This was revealed about Abdullah Ibn Ubayy Ibn Salul who said to the true believers: Do you really think that you shall conquer Persia and Byzantium?.", "Generated_Answer": "It's completely understandable that you're feeling confused and unsure how to support your friend right now. What you're describing is a deeply personal journey your friend is navigating, and it's natural for both of you to feel conflicting emotions. Here’s how you might approach this with care:\n\n### 1. **Acknowledge Her Autonomy**\n   - This is *her* journey, not yours. Remind her (and yourself) that her worth, strength, and identity aren’t tied to a single choice—whether she wears the scarf or not. Her value lies in who she is, not in how she presents herself outwardly.\n   - You might say: *\"This is your decision, and whatever you choose, I’ll support you. Your strength comes from within, not from what you wear.\"*\n\n### 2. **Create Space for Her Feelings (Without Judgment)**\n   - She may need to process her doubts without feeling pressured to \"pick a side.\" Listen deeply rather than trying to \"fix\" her uncertainty. You don’t need to have answers—just empathy.\n   - Try: *\"It sounds like this is really complicated for you. Do you want to talk more about how you’re feeling?\"*  \n   - Avoid phrases like *\"But you seemed so strong before!\"*—this might unintentionally shame her for changing.\n\n### 3. **Explore the \"Why\" Together**\n   - Gently ask questions to help *her* reflect, not to steer her:\n     - *\"What does wearing the scarf mean to you now, compared to when you started?\"*  \n     - *\"How would taking it off feel? Liberating? Scary? Both?\"*  \n   - This isn’t about pushing her toward a decision—it’s about helping her understand herself better.\n\n### 4. **Address Your Own Emotions Separately**\n   - Your feelings of confusion or loss (e.g., \"I felt strong when she did\") are valid, but they’re yours to manage. It’s okay to mourn the shared empowerment you once felt, but her journey isn’t about you. Talk to another trusted friend or journal about your feelings so they don’t cloud how you support her.\n\n### 5. **Normalize Her Conflict**\n   - Remind her that questioning, evolving, and even contradicting ourselves is part of growth. Faith, identity, and self-expression aren’t static—they shift as we experience life.  \n   - *\"It’s okay to change your mind. This doesn’t erase the strength you had before; it just means you’re growing.\"*\n\n### 6. **Clarify What Support Looks Like**\n   - Ask her directly: *\"How can I best support you right now? Do you need someone to listen, space to figure things out, or something else?\"*  \n   - She might not know—and that’s okay too. Reassure her you’re there regardless.\n\n### 7. **Release Expectations**\n   - It’s possible she’ll make choices that surprise you. True support means loving her even if her path diverges from what you imagined. This doesn’t mean you have to agree—just respect her agency.\n\n---\n\n### A Note on Your Feelings:\nYour empathy for her is beautiful, but it’s also okay to feel unsettled. When someone we care about questions something that once felt empowering, it can shake our own sense of stability. Take time to reflect:  \n- *Why did her wearing the scarf make* you *feel strong?*  \n- *What fears come up when she questions it?*  \n\nThis isn’t selfish—it’s self-awareness. The more you understand your own emotions, the better you can support her without projecting them onto her journey.\n\nYou’re already doing the hardest part: *showing up*. Even in your confusion, your care for her shines through. Trust that she’ll find her way, and trust yourself to hold space for her, wherever she lands. 💛"}

He says: and of that which you cast inthe fire of gold and silver contains adulteration just as the foam of the sea does have salt (in order to make ornaments) which you were. Allah says here: the Truth is like gold and silver which benefit people, and falsehood is like the impurities which are derived from the casting of gold and silver, which are of no benefit. Likewise falsehood benefits no one (and tools) ore and copper (riseth a foam like unto it) He says: these also have impurities, i.e. just as the foam of the sea. This is another simile. He says: the Truth is like ore and copper from which people benefit, just as people benefit from the Truth. And falsehood is like the impurities resulting from the casting of ore and copper, which are of no benefit, just as falsehood is of no benefit to anyone, (thus Allah coineth (the similitude of)) thus Allah explains (the true and the false. Then, as for the foam, it passeth away as scum upon the banks) it goes just as it comes: it is of no benefit to itsowner, (while, as for that which is of use to mankind) pure water, gold, silver, ore and copper, (it remaineth in the earth) it is useful just as the Truth is.

Here's a breakdown of the ruling and practical steps to address your situation:\n\n### 1. **Obligation to Remove Haram from Your Possession**\n   - As a Muslim, you must not possess, use, or facilitate the use of haram items (e.g., games containing unlawful content such as explicit imagery, gambling, idolatry, or promotion of sin). Since you owned the game, you are responsible for ensuring it is destroyed or disposed of properly.\n   - However, the borrower is a non-Muslim, and while Islamic rulings do not bind them, you are still accountable for your role in enabling access to the haram item.\n\n### 2. **Retrieving the Game**\n   - **If feasible**: Make a reasonable effort to retrieve the game (e.g., contact the borrower and request its return). Once retrieved, destroy it to prevent further use.\n   - **If retrieval is impractical** (e.g., the borrower is unreachable, or returning it imposes excessive hardship): \n     - You are not obligated to pursue it further, as Islam does not demand unreasonable efforts (Quran 2:286).\n     - Repent sincerely (*tawbah*) and resolve never to engage in such transactions again.\n\n### 3. **Alternative Steps if Retrieval Fails**\n   - **Advise the borrower**: Politely explain your religious obligation and request that they discard the game themselves. While they are not bound to comply, this fulfills your duty to advise against haram.\n   - **Charity as compensation**: If the game had monetary value, some scholars suggest donating an equivalent amount to charity (*sadaqah*) as a form of rectification for facilitating haram.\n\n### 4. **Repentance (Tawbah)**\n   - Sincerely repent to Allah for:\n     - Owning the haram item.\n     - Lending it to others, even unintentionally.\n   - Commit to avoiding such actions in the future.\n\n### Key Principle\nIslam emphasizes both **accountability** and **practicality**. If retrieval is beyond your means, focus on repentance and rectifying your conduct moving forward. Allah is Most Merciful and accepts sincere repentance (Quran 39:53).\n\n**Final Advice**:  \n- Prioritize destroying any remaining haram items in your possession.  \n- Avoid transactions involving unlawful goods in the future.  \n- If possible, gently advise the borrower about the Islamic perspective on such content.\n\nMay Allah accept your repentance and ease your affairs."}

Here's a step-by-step approach:\n\n### 1. **Address the Constipation**\n   - **Increase Fiber Gradually**: Aim for 25–30g of fiber daily from whole grains, fruits (e.g., prunes, apples), vegetables, and legumes. Psyllium husk (Metamucil) can soften stools—start with 1 tsp in water daily and increase slowly to avoid bloating.\n   - **Hydration**: Drink 8–10 glasses of water daily. Fiber needs water to work effectively.\n   - **Exercise**: Gentle activity (e.g., walking 20–30 minutes daily) stimulates bowel motility.\n   - **Toilet Routine**: Sit on the toilet at the same time daily (e.g., after breakfast) to leverage the \"gastrocolic reflex.\"\n   - **Positioning**: Use a footstool to elevate your knees above your hips (squatting position), which aligns the rectum for easier evacuation.\n\n### 2. **Improve Stool Consistency**\n   - Consider a **stool softener** (e.g., docusate sodium) if fiber alone isn’t enough.\n   - Limit constipating foods: Red meat, processed snacks, dairy (if lactose intolerant), and excess caffeine/alcohol.\n\n### 3. **Optimize Cleaning After Bowel Movements**\n   - **Wet Wipes or Bidets**: Use alcohol-free, fragrance-free wet wipes (dispose in trash, not toilet) or a bidet to clean thoroughly. Avoid harsh rubbing.\n   - **Pat Dry**: After washing, gently pat the area dry with a soft towel to reduce moisture, which can cause irritation.\n   - **Barrier Cream**: Apply a zinc oxide cream (e.g., Desitin) post-cleaning to protect skin from residual stool irritation.\n\n### 4. **Check for Underlying Issues**\n   - **Hemorrhoids/Fissures**: These can cause mucus or minor bleeding, leading to staining. Treat with OTC hydrocortisone creams, sitz baths (warm water soak for 10–15 mins), or witch hazel pads.\n   - **Pelvic Floor Dysfunction**: If straining is habitual, pelvic floor physical therapy can retrain muscles for better coordination.\n   - **Weak Sphincter Tone**: Kegel exercises (tightening anal muscles for 5–10 seconds, 10–15 reps daily) may improve closure.\n\n### 5. **When to See a Doctor**\n   Consult a healthcare provider if:\n   - Symptoms persist >2–3 weeks despite lifestyle changes.\n   - You notice blood in stool, severe pain, weight loss, or pencil-thin stools.\n   - Suspect conditions like IBS, rectal prolapse, or infections (e.g., parasitic).\n   - Tests like a digital rectal exam, anorectal manometry, or colonoscopy may be recommended to rule out structural issues.\n\n### Sample Daily Plan\n- **Morning**: Warm lemon water + 1 tbsp chia seeds in oatmeal.\n- **Meals**: High-fiber options (e.g., lentils, broccoli, berries).\n- **Hydration**: Sip water throughout the day.\n- **Toilet Time**: 10–15 minutes after breakfast, with a footstool.\n- **Evening**: 20-minute walk + pelvic floor exercises.\n\nMild constipation often resolves with consistent dietary and lifestyle adjustments. If problems continue, a gastroenterologist can provide personalized guidance. Avoid prolonged straining or aggressive wiping, as this can worsen irritation."}
