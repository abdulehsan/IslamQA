{"Question": "Q: A member of my family ordered a pizza from a takeaway which I do not trust as there is a rumour that the chicken could be dodgy, anyway one of the pizza slices touched my home cooked food which I was eating so my question is will this make my food haraam because I ate the roti which the slice touched. ? --T--", "Answer": "It will not be haraam. And Allah Taala ( ) knows best", "Document": "Narrated Wahab bin Kaisan:Jabir bin `Abdullah said, \"Allahs Apostle sent troops to the sea coast and appointed Abu Ubaida bin Al-Jarrah as their commander, and they were 300 (men). We set out, and we had covered some distance on the way, when our journey food ran short. So Abu Ubaida ordered that all the food present with the troops be collected, and it was collected. Our journey food was dates, and Abu Ubaida kept on giving us our daily ration from it little by little (piecemeal) till it decreased to such an extent that we did not receive except a date each.\" I asked (Jabir), \"How could one date benefit you?\" He said, \"We came to know its value when even that finished.\" Jabir added, \"Then we reached the sea (coast) where we found a fish like a small mountain. The people (i.e. troops) ate of it for 18 nights (i.e. days). Then Abu Ubaida ordered that two of its ribs be fixed on the ground (in the form of an arch) and that a she-camel be ridden and passed under them. So it passed under them without touching them.\"<D>Narrated Jabir bin `Abdullah:\"Allahs Apostle sent an army towards the east coast and appointed Abu Ubaida bin Al-Jarrah as their chief, and the army consisted of three-hundred men including myself. We marched on till we reached a place where our food was about to finish. Abu- Ubaida ordered us to collect all the journey food and it was collected. My (our) journey food was dates. Abu Ubaida kept on giving us our daily ration in small amounts from it, till it was exhausted. The share of everyone of us used to be one date only.\" I said, \"How could one date benefit you?\" Jabir replied, \"We came to know its value when even that too finished.\" Jabir added, \"When we reached the sea-shore, we saw a huge fish which was like a small mountain. The army ate from it for eighteen days. Then Abu Ubaida ordered that two of its ribs be fixed and they were fixed in the ground.

So a bowl containing a lot of Tharid with pieces of meat was brought to us, and presented for us to eat from it. So I began wandering my around it while the Messenger of Allah () ate from what was in front of him. He grabbed my right hand with his left hand, then he said: O Ikrash! Eat from one spot, for indeed the food is one. Then a plate containing various dried dates\" - or fresh dates - Ubaidullah (a narrator) was not sure. He said: \"I began eating what was in front of me, while the hand of the Messenger of Allah () roamed about the plate. He said: O Ikrash! Eat from wherever you like, for indeed it is not all from the same variety. Then water was brought, so the Messenger of Allah () washed his hands, and with the wetness of his hands he wiped his face, his forearms, and his head, and he said: O Ikrash!

", "Generated_Answer": "Based on your description, it is highly unlikely that your home-cooked roti became haram. Here's a breakdown of why, according to general Islamic principles:\n\n1.  **The Nature of \"Dodgy Chicken\" and Rumours:**\n    *   You mentioned a *rumour* about the chicken being \"dodgy.\" In Islamic jurisprudence, rulings are generally based on certainty or strong probability, not mere speculation or rumours. Unless you have concrete, reliable evidence that the chicken was indeed haram (e.g., pork mixed in, explicitly non-halal slaughtered meat confirmed by the owner, or visibly rotten/impure *najis*), you should not assume it is.\n    *   Even if the chicken was *not* slaughtered Islamically (non-zabihah), it is generally considered impermissible to consume for a Muslim, but the meat itself is **not considered ritually impure (najis)** in the same way pork or alcohol is.\n\n2.  **Contact and Contamination (Najasa):**\n    *   For something to become ritually impure (najis) and thus haram through contact, it usually requires contact with a *najis 'ayn* (inherently impure substance) like pork, alcohol, blood, urine, faeces, or carrion, and often involves a transfer of the substance, especially if wet.\n    *   If the \"dodgy\" aspect simply means it's not properly slaughtered according to Islamic rites, then while consuming *that specific chicken* would be forbidden for you, its contact with another halal food (like your roti) does not automatically render the entire roti haram or najis, especially if there was no transfer of a ritually impure substance.\n    *   A general pizza slice (even if it contains non-zabihah chicken) is not considered inherently *najis* in a way that would contaminate other dry food it briefly touches.\n\n3.  **The Principle of Certainty:**\n    *   The basic principle in Islam is that things are permissible (halal) until proven otherwise. Your home-cooked roti was undoubtedly halal. To declare it haram, you would need clear and certain evidence of contamination with something ritually impure (najis). A rumour about \"dodgy chicken\" and a brief touch by a pizza slice does not meet this threshold.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nGiven that it was a rumour about the chicken, and there's no indication that the pizza slice contained a ritually impure substance (like pork or alcohol) that transferred to your roti, your roti **would remain halal**. You do not need to worry about having eaten it.\n\nIn the future, it's always best to consume food from sources you trust to be genuinely halal and wholesome. However, in this specific instance of unintentional contact based on a rumour, there is no need for concern or to consider your food haram."}
{"Question": "When you do ghusl and you have to make sure all your hair or skin is wet, does this mean that you have to maintain its wetness till the end of the ghusl? ? --T--", "Answer": "Assalamu alaykum Yes, one must indeed wash all of the hairs on ones body to the roots. One should be sure to avoid misgivings (waswasa) regarding this. Please look up baseless misgivings and doubts in the SunniPath archives (at www.SunniPath.com) in this regard. One is not obliged to perform the ritual bath (ghusl) in one sitting. The ghusl is valid as long as the entirety of ones body is washed, regardless of whether the whole body is wet by the end or whether some parts are dry and others wet. It is however a confirmed sunna to perform it from beginning to end without an unnecessarily prolonged delay", "Document": "It was narrated that Aishah said:\"When the Messenger of Allah () performed Ghusl from Janabah, he would wash his hands, then perform Wudu as for prayer, then he would perform Ghusl, then run his fingers through his hair to be sure that the water pour water over his head three times, then wash the rest of his body.\"<D>Narrated Abu Huraira:The Prophet (or Abul Qasim) said, \"While a man was walking, clad in a two-piece garment and proud of himself with his hair well-combed, suddenly Allah made him sink into the earth and he will go on sinking into it till the Day of Resurrection.<D>Narrated Hisham bin `Urwa:(on the authority of his father) `Aisha said, \"Whenever Allahs Apostle took the bath of Janaba, he cleaned his hands and performed ablution like that for prayer and then took a bath and rubbed his hair, till he felt that the whole skin of the head had become wet, then he would pour water thrice and wash the rest of the body.\" `Aisha further said, \"I and Allahs Apostle used to take a bath from a single water container, from which we took water simultaneously.\"<D>(Or (bethink thee) the like of him who, passing by a township) He says: do you not know about Uzayr Ibn Shurahya who passed by the township of Dayr Hiraql (which had fallen into utter ruin, exclaimed: How shall Allah give this township life after its death) How can Allah bring the people of this township back to life after their death? (So Allah made him die) right on the spot (a hundred years, then brought him back to life) at the end of the day. (He) Allah (said: How long hast thou tarried) O Uzayr? (He said: I have tarried for aday) and then looked at the sun still in the horizon and said (or part of a day. He) Allah (said: Nay, but thouhast tarried) you were dead (for a hundred years. Just look at thy food) figs and grapes (and drink) juice(which have not rotted! Look at thine ass!) look at the bones of your ass how white they look! (And, thatWe may make thee a token) a sign (to mankind) regarding the matter of bringing the dead to life, that they will be resurrected in the same state they died in, because Uzayr died young and was brought back to life as a young person. It is said that Allah made him a lesson for people, for he died when he was 40 years old and was brought back to life when his son was 120 years old, (look at the bones) the bones of your ass, (how We adjust them and then cover them with flesh!) after this. He then said: We will make grow on it nerves and veins, flesh, skin and hair and put the spirit in it. (And when (the matter) became clear untohim) how Allah gathers the bones, (he said: I know) I had known (that Allah is Able to do all things) of lifeand death. <D>(And the cattle) i.e. the camels (hath He created, whence ye have warm clothing) made of their skin (and uses) you drink their milk and use them as a means of transport, (and whereof ye eat) and you eat their meat.<D>(On honoured leaves) He says: the Quran is written on scrolls made of skin which are honoured in the sight of Allah", "Generated_Answer": "No, you do **not** have to maintain the wetness of your entire body or hair throughout the entire ghusl.\n\nThe essential requirement (fard) of ghusl is that water must reach and flow over every part of your body, including all your skin and hair (even long hair, ensuring the roots are wet).\n\nOnce a part of your body or hair has been thoroughly wetted with the intention of ghusl, it has fulfilled its requirement, even if it starts to dry while you are washing other parts of your body.\n\n**Think of it this way:**\n\n*   When you do wudu (ablution), you wash your face, then your arms. Your face starts drying while you're washing your arms, but your wudu is still valid.\n*   Ghusl works on a similar principle, just on a larger scale for the whole body.\n\n**The key is to ensure:**\n\n1.  **Intention (Niyyah):** You intend to perform ghusl for purification.\n2.  **Completeness:** Water reaches **every** part of your accessible body (skin, hair, inside the belly button, under folds of skin, between toes, etc.) at least once during the process.\n\nSo, you can wash your head and hair, then move on to your right side, then your left side. If your hair starts to dry while you're washing your legs, it doesn't invalidate the initial washing of your hair.\n\nMost people achieve this completeness naturally by taking a thorough shower or bath, ensuring water flows over their entire body. Don't overcomplicate it!"}
{"Question": "I am currently working as an Assistant Manager in a cinema. Im finding it very hard to protect my Islam and good character in this job. There is free mixing, alcohol is sold, I am frequently locked in a room with a women  during end of day cash reconciliation and the hours (shift work) make it very hard for me to pray. The reason I took this job was so that my parents could stop working. Al-Hamdo- Lillah I was able to take the burden of work off my Dad. Prior to my getting this job his health had been deteriorating rapidly  he has high blood pressure (he was a bus driver). Soon he will go to Pakistan and stay there for a while  something which I hope will be better for his health and his Islam. At my current cinema I am treated very badly by my boss. However I will soon move to another cinema where Im hoping it will be easier for me to protect myself  most cinemas have a majority of male supervisors and my boss may be more lenient. However there will still be alcohol and the hours will still be long. I currently pray at work  this is very difficult as I have to be available all the time throughout my shift. Things will be easier if I stop doing this and read Kaza when I get home  something which my family are putting pressure on me about. Is there any way I can justify doing this? I dont want to leave because then my Dad will have to start work again in which case his Islam and his health will suffer. Is it ok if I stay in this job until I find a new one  bearing in mind the economic situation and the fact that while working I dont have much time for job seeking. Also it is very difficult to find a truly Halal job in a non-Muslim country  I may be unemployed for years if I leave. Im feeling very trapped ? --T--", "Answer": "Assalamu alaykum, Dear brother, You have to understand that Allah MOST HIGH is the provider and sustainer. Engaging in haram activities to earn rizq deprives that rizq of barakah. You must try to find a new job immediately. Serving alcohol, or being associated with it in any way is haraam. According to a hadith, all of the people associate with alcohol are cursed by Allah MOST HIGH.Narrated Jabir bin Abdullah: I heard Allahs Messenger, in the year of the Conquest of Mecca, saying, Allah and His Messenger made illegal the trade of alcohol, dead animals, pigs and idols. The people asked, O Allahs Messenger! What about the fat of dead animals, for it was used for greasing the boats and the hides; and people use it for lights? He said, No, it is illegal. Allahs Messenger further said, May Allah curse the Jews, for Allah made the fat (of animals) illegal for them, yet they melted the fat and sold it and ate its price.Ibn Abbas (Allah be pleased with him) reported: This news reached Umar that Samura had sold wine, whereupon he said: May Allah destroy Samura; does he not know that Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: Let there be the curse of Allah upon the Jews that fat was declared forbidden for them, but they melted it and then sold it?>From the way that you write, it seems that you are from England. I do know that in England there is a very good social security system that helps unemployed people. If this is not the case, continue to work there until you find more work, then leave the job. WassalaamZia ul Haque SheikhA short bio:Zia ul Haque Sheikh, born in Azad kashmir (Pakistani side of Kashmir) in 1969.Emigrated to UK when I was four years old.Started Islamic Education at the age of 13. Completed memorization of Quran at 16, then went on to complete the alim course. All education was conducted in the UK, at the Institute of Islamic Education, Dewsbury. Studies totalled 12 years.After graduating in 1994, was imam in Manchester, England, for one year. Then I moved to the USA, and have been an imam at various Islamic Centers.Currently Imam and teacher at the Islamic Community of Tampa Bay, Florida", "Document": "Narrated Aisha:(the wife of the Prophet) \"Whenever Allahs Apostle intended to go on a journey, he would draw lots amongst his wives and would take with him the one upon whom the lot fell. During a Ghazwa of his, he drew lots amongst us and the lot fell upon me, and I proceeded with him after Allah had decreed the use of the veil by women. I was carried in a Howdah (on the camel) and dismounted while still in it. When Allahs Apostle was through with his Ghazwa and returned home, and we approached the city of Medina, Allahs Apostle ordered us to proceed at night. When the order of setting off was given, I walked till I was past the army to answer the call of nature. After finishing I returned (to the camp) to depart (with the others) and suddenly realized that my necklace over my chest was missing. So, I returned to look for it and was delayed because of that. The people who used to carry me on the camel, came to my Howdah and put it on the back of the camel, thinking that I was in it, as, at that time, women were light in weight, and thin and lean, and did not use to eat much. So, those people did not feel the difference in the heaviness of the Howdah while lifting it, and they put it over the camel. At that time I was a young lady. They set the camel moving and proceeded on. I found my necklace after the army had gone, and came to their camp to find nobody. So, I went to the place where I used to stay, thinking that they would discover my absence and come back in my search. While in that state, I felt sleepy and slept. Safwan bin Muattal As-Sulami Adh-Dhakwani was behind the army and reached my abode in the morning. When he saw a sleeping person, he came to me, and he used to see me before veiling. So, I got up when I heard him saying, \"Inna lil-lah-wa inn a ilaihi rajiun (We are for Allah, and we will return to Him).\" He made his camel knell down. He got down from his camel, and put his leg on the front legs of the camel and then I rode and sat over it. Safwan set out walking, leading the camel by the rope till we reached the army who had halted to take rest at midday. Then whoever was meant for destruction, fell into destruction, (some people accused me falsely) and the leader of the false accusers was `Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul. After that we returned to Medina, and I became ill for one month while the people were spreading the forged statements of the false accusers. I was feeling during my ailment as if I were not receiving the usual kindness from the Prophet which I used to receive from him when I got sick. But he would come, greet and say, How is that (girl)? I did not know anything of what was going on till I recovered from my ailment and went out with Um Mistah to the Manasi where we used to answer the call of nature, and we used not to go to answer the call of nature except from night to night and that was before we had lavatories near to our houses. And this habit of ours was similar to the habit of the old Arabs in the open country (or away from houses). So. I and Um Mistah bint Ruhm went out walking. Um Mistah stumbled because of her long dress and on that she said, Let Mistah be ruined. I said, You are saying a bad word. Why are you abusing a man who took part in (the battle of) Badr? She said, O Hanata (you there) didnt you hear what they said? Then she told me the rumors of the false accusers. My sickness was aggravated, and when I returned home, Allahs Apostle came to me, and after greeting he said, How is that (girl)? I requested him to allow me to go to my parents. I wanted then to be sure of the news through them I Allahs Apostle allowed me, and I went to my parents and asked my mother, What are the people talking about? She said, O my daughter! Dont worry much about this matter. By Allah, never is there a charming woman loved by her husband who has other wives, but the women would forge false news about her. I said, Glorified be Allah! Are the people really taking of this matter? That night I kept on weeping and could not sleep till morning. In the morning Allahs Apostle called `Ali bin Abu Talib and Usama bin Zaid when he saw the Divine Inspiration delayed, to consul them about divorcing his wife (i.e. `Aisha). Usama bin Zaid said what he knew of the good reputation of his wives and added, O Allahs Apostle! Keep you wife, for, by Allah, we know nothing about her but good. `Ali bin Abu Talib said, O Allahs Apostle! Allah has no imposed restrictions on you, and there are many women other than she, yet you may ask the woman-servant who will tell you the truth. On that Allahs Apostle called Buraira and said, O Burair. Did you ever see anything which roused your suspicions about her? Buraira said, No, by Allah Who has sent you with the Truth, I have never seen in her anything faulty except that she is a girl of immature age, who sometimes sleeps and leaves the dough for the goats to eat. On that day Allahs Apostle ascended the pulpit and requested that somebody support him in punishing `Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul. Allahs Apostle said, Who will support me to punish that person (`Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul) who has hurt me by slandering the reputation of my family? By Allah, I know nothing about my family but good, and they have accused a person about whom I know nothing except good, and he never entered my house except in my company. Sa`d bin Mu`adh got up and said, O Allahs Apostle! by Allah, I will relieve you from him. If that man is from the tribe of the Aus, then we will chop his head off, and if he is from our brothers, the Khazraj, then order us, and we will fulfill your order. On that Sa`d bin Ubada, the chief of the Khazraj and before this incident, he had been a pious man, got up, motivated by his zeal for his tribe and said, By Allah, you have told a lie; you cannot kill him, and you will never be able to kill him. On that Usaid bin Al-Hadir got up and said (to Sa`d bin Ubada), By Allah! you are a liar. By Allah, we will kill him; and you are a hypocrite, defending the hypocrites. On this the two tribes of Aus and Khazraj got excited and were about to fight each other, while Allahs Apostle was standing on the pulpit. He got down and quieted them till they became silent and he kept quiet. On that day I kept on weeping so much so that neither did my tears stop, nor could I sleep. In the morning my parents were with me and I had wept for two nights and a day, till I thought my liver would burst from weeping. While they were sitting with me and I was weeping, an Ansari woman asked my permission to enter, and I allowed her to come in. She sat down and started weeping with me. While we were in this state, Allahs Apostle came and sat down and he had never sat with me since the day they forged the accusation. No revelation regarding my case came to him for a month. He recited Tashah-hud (i.e. None has the right to be worshipped but Allah and Muhammad is His Apostle) and then said, O `Aisha! I have been informed such-and-such about you; if you are innocent, then Allah will soon reveal your innocence, and if you have committed a sin, then repent to Allah and ask Him to forgive you, for when a person confesses his sin and asks Allah for forgiveness, Allah accepts his repentance. When Allahs Apostle finished his speech my tears ceased completely and there remained not even a single drop of it. I requested my father to reply to Allahs Apostle on my behalf. My father said, By Allah, I do not know what to say to Allahs Apostle. I said to my mother, Talk to Allahs Apostle on my behalf. She said, By Allah, I do not know what to say to Allahs Apostle. I was a young girl and did not have much knowledge of the Quran. I said. I know, by Allah, that you have listened to what people are saying and that has been planted in your minds and you have taken it as a truth. Now, if I told you that I am innocent and Allah knows that I am innocent, you would not believe me and if I confessed to you falsely that I am guilty, and Allah knows that I am innocent you would believe me. By Allah, I dont compare my situation with you except to the situation of Josephs father (i.e. Jacob) who said, So (for me) patience is most fitting against that which you assert and it is Allah (Alone) whose help can be sought. Then I turned to the other side of my bed hoping that Allah would prove my innocence. By Allah I never thought that Allah would reveal Divine Inspiration in my case, as I considered myself too inferior to be talked of in the Holy Quran. I had hoped that Allahs Apostle might have a dream in which Allah would prove my innocence. By Allah, Allahs Apostle had not got up and nobody had left the house before the Divine Inspiration came to Allahs Apostle. So, there overtook him the same state which used to overtake him, (when he used to have, on being inspired divinely). He was sweating so much so that the drops of the sweat were dropping like pearls though it was a (cold) wintry day. When that state of Allahs Apostle was over, he was smiling and the first word he said, `Aisha! Thank Allah, for Allah has declared your innocence. My mother told me to go to Allahs Apostle . I replied, By Allah I will not go to him and will not thank but Allah. So Allah revealed: \"Verily! They who spread the slander are a gang among you . . .\" (24.11) When Allah gave the declaration of my Innocence, Abu Bakr, who used to provide for Mistah bin Uthatha for he was his relative, said, By Allah, I will never provide Mistah with anything because of what he said about Aisha. But Allah later revealed: -- \"And let not those who are good and wealthy among you swear not to help their kinsmen, those in need and those who left their homes in Allahs Cause. Let them forgive and overlook. Do you not wish that Allah should forgive you? Verily! Allah is Oft-forgiving, Most Merciful.\" (24.22) After that Abu Bakr said, Yes ! By Allah! I like that Allah should forgive me, and resumed helping Mistah whom he used to help before. Allahs Apostle also asked Zainab bint Jahsh (i.e. the Prophets wife about me saying, What do you know and what did you see? She replied, O Allahs Apostle! I refrain to claim hearing or seeing what I have not heard or seen. By Allah, I know nothing except goodness about Aisha.\" Aisha further added \"Zainab was competing with me (in her beauty and the Prophets love), yet Allah protected her (from being malicious), for she had piety.\"<D>Narrated Sa`id bin Jubair:I said to Ibn `Abbas, \"Nauf Al-Bukah claims that Moses, the companion of Al-Khadir was not Moses (the prophet) of the children of Israel, but some other Moses.\" Ibn `Abbas said, \"Allahs enemy (i.e. Nauf) has told a lie. Ubai bin Ka`b told us that the Prophet said, Once Moses stood up and addressed Bani Israel. He was asked who was the most learned man amongst the people. He said, I. Allah admonished him as he did not attribute absolute knowledge to Him (Allah). So, Allah said to him, Yes, at the junction of the two seas there is a Slave of Mine who is more learned than you. Moses said, O my Lord! How can I meet him? Allah said, Take a fish and put it in a large basket and you will find him at the place where you will lose the fish. Moses took a fish and put it in a basket and proceeded along with his (servant) boy, Yusha` bin Noon, till they reached the rock where they laid their heads (i.e. lay down). Moses slept, and the fish, moving out of the basket, fell into the sea. It took its way into the sea (straight) as in a tunnel. Allah stopped the flow of water over the fish and it became like an arch (the Prophet pointed out this arch with his hands). They travelled the rest of the night, and the next day Moses said to his boy (servant), Give us our food, for indeed, we have suffered much fatigue in this journey of ours. Moses did not feel tired till he crossed that place which Allah had ordered him to seek after. His boy (servant) said to him, Do you know that when we were sitting near that rock, I forgot the fish, and none but Satan caused me to forget to tell (you) about it, and it took its course into the sea in an amazing way?. So there was a path for the fish and that astonished them. Moses said, That was what we were seeking after. So, both of them retraced their footsteps till they reached the rock. There they saw a man Lying covered with a garment. Moses greeted him and he replied saying, How do people greet each other in your land? Moses said, I am Moses. The man asked, Moses of Bani Israel? Moses said, Yes, I have come to you so that you may teach me from those things which Allah has taught you. He said, O Moses! I have some of the Knowledge of Allah which Allah has taught me, and which you do not know, while you have some of the Knowledge of Allah which Allah has taught you and which I do not know. Moses asked, May I follow you? He said, But you will not be able to remain patient with me for how can you be patient about things which you will not be able to understand? (Moses said, You will find me, if Allah so will, truly patient, and I will not disobey you in aught.) So, both of them set out walking along the sea-shore, a boat passed by them and they asked the crew of the boat to take them on board. The crew recognized Al-Khadir and so they took them on board without fare. When they were on board the boat, a sparrow came and stood on the edge of the boat and dipped its beak once or twice into the sea. Al-Khadir said to Moses, O Moses! My knowledge and your knowledge have not decreased Allahs Knowledge except as much as this sparrow has decreased the water of the sea with its beak. Then suddenly Al-Khadir took an adze and plucked a plank, and Moses did not notice it till he had plucked a plank with the adze. Moses said to him, What have you done? They took us on board charging us nothing; yet you I have intentionally made a hole in their boat so as to drown its passengers. Verily, you have done a dreadful thing. Al-Khadir replied, Did I not tell you that you would not be able to remain patient with me? Moses replied, Do not blame me for what I have forgotten, and do not be hard upon me for my fault. So the first excuse of Moses was that he had forgotten. When they had left the sea, they passed by a boy playing with other boys. Al-Khadir took hold of the boys head and plucked it with his hand like this. (Sufyan, the sub narrator pointed with his fingertips as if he was plucking some fruit.) Moses said to him, \"Have you killed an innocent person who has not killed any person? You have really done a horrible thing.\" Al-Khadir said, \"Did I not tell you that you could not remain patient with me? Moses said \"If I ask you about anything after this, dont accompany me. You have received an excuse from me. Then both of them went on till they came to some people of a village, and they asked its inhabitant for wood but they refused to entertain them as guests. Then they saw therein a wall which was just going to collapse (and Al Khadir repaired it just by touching it with his hands). (Sufyan, the sub-narrator, pointed with his hands, illustrating how Al-Khadir passed his hands over the wall upwards.) Moses said, \"These are the people whom we have called on, but they neither gave us food, nor entertained us as guests, yet you have repaired their wall. If you had wished, you could have taken wages for it.\" Al-Khadir said, \"This is the parting between you and me, and I shall tell you the explanation of those things on which you could not remain patient.\" The Prophet added, \"We wished that Moses could have remained patient by virtue of which Allah might have told us more about their story. (Sufyan the sub-narrator said that the Prophet said, \"May Allah bestow His Mercy on Moses! If he had remained patient, we would have been told further about their case.\")<D>Sa, id b. jubair reported that it was said to Ibn Abbas that Nauf al-Bikali was of the opinion that Moses who went in search of knowledge was not the Moses of Bani Israil. He said:Said, did you hear it from him? I said: Yes. Thereupon he said that Nauf had not stated the fact. Ubayy b. Kab narrated to us that he had heard Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: Moses had been delivering sermons to his people. And he made this remark: No person upon the earth has better knowledge than I or nothing better than mine. Thereupon Allah revealed to him: I know one who is better than you (in knowledge) or there is a person on the earth having more knowledge than you. Thereupon he said: My Lord, direct me to him. It was said to him: Keep a salted fish as a provision for journey. The place where that fish would be lost (there you will find that man). So he set forth and a young slave along with him until they came to a place Sakhra. but he did not find any clue. So he proceeded on and left that young man there. The fish began to stir in water and the water assumed the form of an ark over the fish. The young man said: I should meet Allahs Apostle (peace be upon him) and inform him, but he was made to forget and when they had gone beyond that place, he (Moses) said to the young man: Bring breakfast. We have been exhausted because of the journey, and he (Moses) was not exhausted until he had crossed that (particular) place (where he had) to meet Khadir, and the youth was reminded and said: Did you not see that as we reached Sakhra I forgot the fish and it is satan alone who has made me forgetful of it? It is strange that he has been able to find way in the ocean too. He said: This is what we sought for us. They returned retracing their steps, and he (his companion) pointed to him the location (where) the fish (had been lost). Moses began to search him there. He suddenly saw Khadir wrapped in a cloth and lying on his back. He said to him: As-Salamu-Alaikum. He removed the cloth from his face and said: Wa Alaikum-us-Salam! Who are you? He said: I am Moses. He said: Who Moses? He said: Moses Of Bani Israil. He said: What brought you here? He said: I have come so that you may teach me what you have been taught of righteousness. He said: You shall have to bear with me, and how can you have patience about a thing of which you have no comprehensive knowledge? You will not have patience when you see me doing a thing I have been ordered to do. He said: If Allah pleases, you will find me patient, nor shall I disobey you in aught. Khadir said: If you follow me, dont ask me about anything until I explain it to you. So they went on until they embarked upon a boat. He (Khadir) made a hole in that. Thereupon he (Moses) said: You have done this so that you may drown the persons sitting in the boat. You have done something grievous. Thereupon he said: Did I not tell you that you will not be able to bear with me? Thereupon he (Moses) said: Blame me not for what I forgot and be not hard upon me for what I did. (Khadir gave him another chance.) So they went on until they reached a place where boys were playing. He went to one of them and caught holdof one (apparently) at random and killed him. Moses (peace be upon him) felt agitated and said: You have killed an innocent person not guilty of slaying another. You have done something aboininable. Thereupon Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: May Allah have mercy upon us and Moses. Had he shown patience he would have seen wonderful things, but fear of blame, with respect to his companion, seized him and he said: If I ask anything after this, keep not company with me. You will then have a valid excuse in my case, and had he (Moses) shown patience he would have seen many wonderful things. He (the narrator) said: Whenever he (the Holy Prophet) made mention of any Prophet, he always said: May there be mercy of Allah upon us and upon my brother so and so. They, however, proceeded on until they came to the inhabitants of a village who were very miserly. They went to the meeting places and asked for hospitality but they refused to show any hospitality to them. They both found in that village a wall which was about to fall. He (Khadir) set it right. Thereupon he (Moses) said: If you so liked. you could get wages for it. Thereupon he said: This is the partince, of ways between me and you, and, taking hold of his cloth, he said: Now I will explain to you the real significance (of all these acts) for which you could not show patience. As for the boat, it belonged to the poor people working on the river and I intended to damage it for there was ahead of them (a king) who seized boats by force. (When he came) to catch hold of it he found it a damaged boat, so he spared it (and later on) it was set right with wood. So far as the boy is concerned, he has been, by very nature, an unbeliever, whereas his parents loved him very much. Had he grown up he would have involved them in wrongdoing and unbelief, so we wished that their Lord should give them in its place one better in purity and close to mercy. And as for the wall it belonged to two orphan boys in the city and there was beneath it a (treasure) belongin to them,... up to the last verse. This hadith has been transmitted on the authority of Abu Ishaq.<D>(And We shall turn unto the work they did) the good work they did in the life of this world (and make it) in the Hereafter (scattered motes) like scattered dust in the hooves of beasts; it is also said that this means: like tiny particles of dust which can be seen when, from a hole, light enters into a dark place, but these particles cannot be touched even though one can see them.<D>(Lo! thy Lord) O Muhammad (knoweth how thou keepest vigil sometimes nearly) less than (two thirds of the night) up to half of the night, (or (sometimes) half) and sometimes you keep vigil half of the night (or athird thereof) and you keep vigil a third of the night; it is also said this means: and sometimes less than half of the night, (as do a party of those with thee) and a group of believers with you who keep vigil of the night in prayer. (Allah measureth the night and the day) Allah knows the hours of the day and night. (He knoweth that ye count it not) i.e. keep track of the hours of the night; it is also said that this means: He knows you will not be able to persevere in that which you are commanded of prayer in the night, (and turneth unto you in mercy) and so He forgives you if you do not pray at night. (Recite, then, of the Quran) when youperform the prayers (that which is easy for you) 100 verses and more; and it is also said this means: whatever you wish to recite of the Quran. (He knoweth that there are sick folk among you) wounded people among you who cannot pray at night, (while others travel in the land) fleeing from something or (in search of Allahs bounty) of Allahs provision and other things, and it is hard on them to pray at night, (and others (still) are fighting for the cause of Allah) for the obedience of Allah who will find it hard to pray at night.

(There is no altering (the laws of) Allahs creation) there is no altering of the religion of Allah. (That is the right religion) the straight truth, (but most men know not) that the true religion of Allah is Islam.", "Generated_Answer": "Dear T,\n\nAssalamu Alaikum wa Rahmatullahi wa Barakatuh,\n\nI hear your struggle, and it is indeed a very difficult situation you find yourself in. May Allah reward you immensely for your noble intention and sacrifice to support your parents, especially your father whose health was deteriorating. Taking the burden off your father's shoulders is a great act of filial piety (Birr al-Walidayn), which holds immense reward in Islam. It's clear your heart is with your Deen, and you are trying your best in challenging circumstances. May Allah make it easy for you and grant you a way out.\n\nLet's address your concerns systematically, keeping in mind the principles of Islamic law and the concept of necessity (darurah) and need (hajaa).\n\n**1. Staying in the Job Temporarily Due to Necessity (Darurah/Hajah):**\n\nYou are in a situation where leaving the job would directly lead to significant harm to your father's health and likely compel him to return to work, which would be detrimental to both his physical well-being and possibly his ability to practice Islam (if his health declines further). In Islam, the welfare and rights of parents are paramount.\n\nTherefore, it is permissible for you to **remain in this job temporarily** while you actively and diligently seek a truly halal alternative. This is a case of necessity or dire need. Islam is a religion of ease, and it recognizes that in challenging real-world situations, one might have to endure a less-than-ideal situation to prevent a greater harm. Your intention is pure – to protect your father and his Islam.\n\n**2. Alcohol Sales and Free Mixing:**\n\n*   **Alcohol:** Dealing with alcohol (selling, serving, carrying, etc.) is generally forbidden in Islam. However, given your specific situation (preventing greater harm to your father), it falls under the same umbrella of temporary necessity.\n    *   **Action:** While you are in this job, try your utmost to minimize your direct involvement with alcohol. For example, if there are specific tasks related to alcohol that can be delegated to non-Muslim colleagues, or if you can avoid directly handling it, do so. Make sincere *du'a* to Allah to open a way for you to leave this aspect of the job. View every interaction with alcohol as an regrettable necessity until you find an alternative.\n*   **Free Mixing / Khalwa (Seclusion with opposite gender):** Being locked in a room with a woman during cash reconciliation is a serious concern, as it constitutes *khalwa*, which is forbidden in Islam without a mahram.\n    *   **Action:** This is something you must try very hard to mitigate.\n        *   At your current cinema, can you request a male colleague to be present during reconciliation?\n        *   Can the door be left ajar?\n        *   At the new cinema, immediately upon joining, speak to your manager (or HR if necessary) and explain that due to personal/religious reasons, you require a male colleague for cash reconciliation, or that the door must remain open if possible. Be firm but polite. If most supervisors are male, this should hopefully be easier. This is a point where you must make maximum effort to avoid the forbidden. If, after sincere and persistent effort, it remains unavoidable, and leaving the job would cause immediate severe harm to your father, then you are in a very difficult position. You would need to continue making *du'a*, seeking an alternative job, and viewing this as an extreme last resort of necessity, with sincere repentance.\n\n**3. Prayer (Salat) - On Time vs. Qada:**\n\nThis is perhaps the most critical point. Prayer is the pillar of Islam, and performing it within its prescribed time is an obligation that cannot be lightly dismissed. Deliberately delaying a prayer beyond its time without a valid Islamic excuse (like travel, severe illness, or combat) is a major sin.\n\n*   **Your Current Effort:** The fact that you *are* praying at work, despite the difficulty and needing to be available, is commendable and shows your commitment. Continue doing this! This is the correct approach.\n*   **Family Pressure to Pray Qada:** Your family's advice to pray *qada* when you get home, while perhaps well-intentioned (to ease your burden), is Islamically incorrect as a default practice. \"Being busy\" or \"it's difficult at work\" are generally not valid excuses for *deliberately* missing the prayer time and praying *qada*. You are required to exert maximum effort to pray on time.\n*   **When is Qada Permissible (as a last resort)?**\n    *   *Qada* is primarily for when one *unintentionally* misses a prayer (e.g., due to oversleeping, forgetting) or when it is *truly impossible* to perform it on time despite sincere effort (e.g., in a life-threatening emergency, or if performing it would genuinely lead to a severe, unavoidable harm like immediate job loss *which then leads to destitution or severe harm to dependents*).\n    *   In your situation, if performing *Salat* on time (even quickly) during your shift would **genuinely and certainly** lead to you being fired, and being fired would **genuinely and certainly** lead to your father's health collapsing and him returning to work (which you know would be highly detrimental), then you are in an extreme dilemma.\n    *   **Your Responsibility:** You must continue to exert *all possible effort* to pray on time.\n        *   Can you combine Zuhr and Asr prayers (if permissible in your school of thought, usually for travel or specific hardship)?\n        *   Can you combine Maghrib and Isha?\n        *   Can you find just 5-10 minutes during a lull in your shift to pray quickly?\n        *   Can you speak to your boss (at the new cinema, hopefully more lenient) about allowing you brief prayer breaks, even if you remain \"on call\"? Frame it as a necessary personal break.\n        *   Can you pray during your allocated breaks, even if short?\n        *   Can you perform *Salat* even in part of the cinema where you are less visible, if privacy is an issue?\n    *   **Conclusion on Qada:** Only if, after trying *every single possible permutation and exhausting all avenues*, you find it **genuinely, truly, and absolutely impossible** to pray within the time without facing **certain severe and immediate negative consequences** that would impact your father's well-being, *and* you cannot leave the job due to the reasons stated, then you would perform *Qada* with sincere regret, seeking Allah's forgiveness, and constantly making *du'a* for a better situation. This is a debt to Allah and not a permission to delay prayer regularly. Your heart should always be yearning to pray on time.\n\n**4. Finding a New Halal Job:**\n\nThis is your ultimate goal and the solution to your dilemma.\n\n*   **Action:** You must actively and consistently dedicate time to job searching. Even if it's 30 minutes a day, or a few hours on your days off, make it a priority.\n*   **Types of Jobs:** Don't limit yourself to specific industries. Think about roles that are generally halal, like administrative work, IT, teaching, healthcare (non-clinical roles), logistics, etc.\n*   **Networking:** Use your network, attend career fairs, look online, and inform people you trust that you are looking for a new opportunity.\n*   **Skill Development:** Consider if there are any skills you can quickly acquire online that would open up more halal job opportunities.\n*   **Trust in Allah (Tawakkul):** Make constant *du'a* (Istikhara for decisions, and specific *du'as* for provision and a halal livelihood). Allah is Al-Razzaq (The Provider), and if your intention is sincere, He will open doors for you.\n\n**Summary and Practical Steps:**\n\n1.  **Intentions:** Your intention to care for your parents is noble and greatly rewarded. Continue to remind yourself of this.\n2.  **Temporary Necessity:** View your current job as a temporary bridge to a truly halal one. This mindset is crucial.\n3.  **Mitigation:** At the new cinema, immediately assess and work to mitigate the issues of free mixing (especially *khalwa*) and prayer. Be proactive in requesting accommodations.\n4.  **Prayer First:** Continue to make *every* effort to pray on time. This is non-negotiable unless a dire, unavoidable consequence is certain. Do not let family pressure deviate you from this primary obligation. If you genuinely *must* miss a prayer due to unavoidable circumstances leading to grave harm (as discussed above), pray *qada* with a heavy heart and intense regret, seeking Allah's forgiveness, and resolved to rectify the situation.\n5.  **Active Job Seeking:** Dedicate consistent time to finding a new job. This is your way out.\n6.  **Du'a and Tawakkul:** Pray to Allah consistently for ease, guidance, and a halal provision. Trust in His plan.\n\nYou are in a test, and Allah tests those He loves. Your struggle to uphold your Deen while fulfilling your obligations to your parents is a powerful act of worship. May Allah ease your burdens, grant you a way out of this difficult situation, and provide you with a job that is wholesome and blessed, in this life and the next.\n\nAmeen."}

A coffin is essentially a wooden or metallic box, which is not inherently forbidden.\n\n---\n\n**1. Selling Coffins to Muslims:**\n\n*   **Islamic Burial Practice:** The default and most virtuous practice in Islam is to bury the deceased directly in the earth, shrouded in a simple white cloth (kafan), without a coffin. This practice emphasizes humility, equality in death, and adherence to the Sunnah of the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH).\n*   **When Coffins are Used by Muslims:** There are specific circumstances where Muslims might use a coffin, primarily out of necessity or legal requirement:\n    *   **Legal Requirements:** In many Western countries, local laws or cemetery regulations mandate the use of a coffin for burial. In such cases, it becomes a necessity to comply with the law.\n    *   **Medical Reasons:** If the body needs to be transported over a long distance, or if there's a specific medical reason (e.g., highly contagious disease), a sealed coffin might be necessary.\n    *   **Ground Conditions:** If the ground is very rocky or prone to flooding, a coffin might be used to protect the body.\n*   **Permissibility of Selling to Muslims:**\n    *   If a Muslim requires a coffin due to **necessity** (as described above), then selling it to them would likely be permissible, as it facilitates a lawful (albeit non-ideal) burial in circumstances where the ideal is not possible.\n    *   However, if a Muslim is purchasing a coffin out of **preference, extravagance, or imitation of non-Muslim practices without necessity**, then it would be considered discouraged (makrooh) or even disliked in Islam. In such a scenario, selling it could be seen as assisting in something that is not in line with the Sunnah, making it ethically problematic from an Islamic perspective, though not necessarily explicitly Haram.\n    *   **Conclusion for Muslims:** Generally discouraged if not for necessity. Permissible only when there is a clear, unavoidable necessity (like legal mandate or specific circumstances). Engaging in this business primarily for Muslims would be highly questionable due to encouraging a practice contrary to the Sunnah.\n\n---\n\n**2. Selling Coffins to Non-Muslims:**\n\n*   **Non-Muslim Burial Practices:** For many non-Muslim traditions (Christianity, Judaism, secular burials, etc.), the use of a coffin is a standard, and often required, part of their funeral rites.\n*   **Nature of the Item:** As mentioned, a coffin itself is not inherently Haram. It is a container for a deceased body.\n*   **Cooperation in Sin:** Selling a coffin to a non-Muslim for their customary burial rites does not constitute cooperation in sin. Their use of a coffin is part of their own religious or cultural practices, and it does not involve a sin from an Islamic perspective that one is forbidden to aid (like selling alcohol, pork, or aiding in idol worship). Muslims are permitted to trade with non-Muslims in general, even if the non-Muslims use the product in ways a Muslim might not.\n*   **Conclusion for Non-Muslims:** Generally **permissible**. It falls under the category of lawful trade, as you are selling an item that is part of their accepted customs and does not inherently promote any major sin or Shirk (polytheism) on your part.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n*   **Selling coffins to Muslims:** **Discouraged** and potentially impermissible unless there is a clear necessity (e.g., legal requirement, medical need, specific ground conditions).\n*   **Selling coffins to Non-Muslims:** **Permissible**, as it is a lawful trade that facilitates their customary burial practices and does not fall under the prohibition of aiding in sin.\n\nTherefore, a Muslim engaging in the business of selling coffins would generally be considered permissible if their primary clientele are non-Muslims. If they were to sell to Muslims, it should ideally be only when there is a genuine, unavoidable necessity for the Muslim buyer."}
{"Question": "Q: I have waswasahs, and alhamdulillaah I am doing better now in my salah after listening to the advice, but I still have problems with wudoo and I have an issue now about dead skin which I will elaborate about in shaa Allaah. OK so I used a pummelstone on my feet and I had dead skin on my feet then I wore my slippers and performed Wudoo washing my feet under the tap properly and then put my slippers back on and took them off to do salah. After salah I see flakes of dead skin on my feet so I look in my slipper and still see the dead skin from before inside of them so, I have 2 questions: 1. The amount of dead skin was considerable and I am doubtful and irritated by not knowing where it came from for sure. 2. I use a tap in Wudoo and I used a lot of water blasting it on my feet, and I remember rubbing as well, so can I assume that this amount of water is sufficient to penetrate the dead skin and reach the surface of my foot? ? --T--", "Answer": "These are stray thoughts. The wudhu is right. Dont pay attention to it. And Allah Taala ( ) knows best", "Document": "It wasnarrated that ‘Abdullah bin ‘Ukaym said:“There came to us aletter from the Prophet () (saying): ‘No not make use of theuntanned skin and sinew of dead animals.’”<D>Narrated Ibn Abbas:That the Messenger of Allah () said: \"Any skin tanned, then it has been made pure.\"This Hadith is Hasan Sahih. This is acted upon according to most of the people of knowledge, they say that when the skin of a dead animal has been tanned then it has been made pure.[Abu Eisa said:] Ash-Shafii said: \"Any dead animals skin that is tanned, then it has been made pure, except for the dog and the pig.\" Some of the people of knowledge among the Companions of the Prophet () disliked skins of predators even when tanned, and this is the view of Abdullah bin Al-Mubarak, Ahmad and Ishaq, and they were firm about not wearing them and performing Salat in them. Ishaq bin Ibrahim said: \"The saying of the Prophet ():Any skin that is tanned, then it has been made pure only refers to the skins of animals whose meat is eaten.\" This is how it was explained by An-Nasr bin Shumail.<D>It was narraterd from Jabir bin Abdullah that, during the year of the Conquest, while he was in Makkah, he heard the Messenger of Allah say:\"Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, and His Messenger have forbidden the sale of alcohol, dead meat, pigs and idols.\" It was said to him: \"O Messenger of Allah, what do you think of their fat of dead animals, for it is used to caulk ships, it is daubed on animal skins, and people use it to light their lamps?\" He said: \"No, it is unlawful.\" Then the Messenger of Allah said: \"May Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, curse the Jews, for Allah forbade them the fat (of dead animals) but they rendered it, sold it, and consumed its price.\"<D>(And they used to say) in the life of the world: (When we are dead and have come) scattered (dust and)rotten (bones, shall we then, forsooth, be raised again) shall we then be given life again, <D>(They say: When we are dead and have become mere) scattered (dust and) decayed (bones, shall we then, forsooth, be raised again) after we have died? <D>(And Earth yieldeth up her burdens) and the Earth brings out her dead and treasures, ", "Generated_Answer": "Alhamdulillah that you are doing better with your Salah and that you are actively working on overcoming waswasah. This is a great sign of your sincerity and dedication to your deen. Remember, battling waswasah is a form of jihad, and Allah rewards those who strive for His sake.\n\nLet's address your concerns regarding the dead skin and Wudoo:\n\nFirst and foremost, the general principle in Islam is that **certainty is not removed by doubt.** If you performed Wudoo with the certainty that you washed your feet thoroughly, then that certainty remains, and any subsequent doubt or observation (like finding dead skin flakes) does not invalidate what was done with certainty.\n\nNow, let's break down your two questions:\n\n---\n\n### 1. The Origin of the Dead Skin Flakes\n\nYou are doubtful about where the dead skin came from. This is a classic example of how waswasah tries to make you overthink and doubt your actions after they've been completed.\n\n*   **Your Certainty:** You *know* you used a pumice stone before Wudoo, and you *know* you washed your feet thoroughly under the tap, even rubbing them.\n*   **The Doubt:** You saw flakes *after* Salah and wondered if they were there *during* Wudoo and prevented water from reaching your skin.\n\n**The Answer:** It is highly probable that the flakes of dead skin you saw after Salah either:\n    *   Were residual from the pumice stone use that detached *after* your Wudoo (perhaps loosened by the water and rubbing, then fully detached by walking or friction in your slippers).\n    *   Are simply the natural exfoliation of your skin. Our skin constantly sheds dead cells.\n\n**Key Point:** Do not allow this post-Wudoo observation to retroactively invalidate your Wudoo. If you believed your Wudoo was valid at the time you performed it, then it was valid. Waswasah often tries to create these \"what if\" scenarios *after* the fact to make you doubt and repeat. Ignore these whispers.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Sufficiency of Water Penetration Through Dead Skin\n\nYou used a lot of water, blasting it on your feet and rubbing. Can you assume this was sufficient to penetrate the dead skin?\n\n**The Answer: Yes, absolutely.**\n\n*   **What constitutes a barrier for Wudoo?** A barrier is something that completely prevents water from reaching the skin beneath it (e.g., waterproof paint, thick nail polish, thick hardened glue, etc.).\n*   **Dead skin is NOT a barrier.**\n    *   **Natural Process:** Dead skin is a natural part of our body's exfoliation process. If it were a barrier, almost everyone's Wudoo would be invalid because we all have some degree of dead skin.\n    *   **Porous and Softened by Water:** Dead skin is typically porous and easily penetrated or softened by water, especially when you use a \"lot of water blasting it on your feet\" and \"rubbing.\" The water will certainly reach the underlying skin.\n    *   **Ease of Religion:** Islam is a religion of ease, not hardship. Allah (SWT) says in the Quran, *\"Allah intends for you ease and does not intend for you hardship.\"* (Quran 2:185). To suggest that every microscopic piece of dead skin that might be flaking would invalidate Wudoo goes against the spirit and letter of Islamic law, which caters to the general condition of people.\n\n**Conclusion for your Wudoo:**\n\nYour Wudoo was **valid**. The amount of water you used, combined with rubbing, is more than sufficient to ensure water reaches your feet, even if there was some dead skin present. Dead skin, in its normal state (even if flaking), is not considered a barrier that invalidates Wudoo by the vast majority of scholars.\n\n---\n\n### General Advice for Waswasah:\n\n1.  **Ignore it completely:** This is the most effective treatment. When the doubt comes, say \"Bismillah\" and carry on. Do not repeat Wudoo or Salah. Do not overthink.\n2.  **Seek Refuge in Allah:** Say \"A'udhu billahi minash shaytanir rajim\" (I seek refuge in Allah from the accursed Satan) when the whispers come.\n3.  **Know the Devil's Goal:** Shaytan wants to make your worship a burden, make you doubt your actions, and ultimately turn you away from Allah or make you despair. Do not let him win.\n4.  **Focus on the Essentials:** In Wudoo, focus on the obligatory parts (washing each limb once thoroughly). Don't get caught up in microscopic details or obsessions.\n5.  **Trust in Allah's Mercy and Ease:** Allah does not burden a soul beyond its capacity. He wants ease for us in our worship.\n\nKeep up the good work in overcoming waswasah. Your Wudoo was valid, and you should continue to pray with confidence.\n\nAnd Allah knows best."}
{"Question": "I purchased some pants and only after wearing them did I realize the material. It is of 70% wool, 20% cashmere, 10% silk (does not say pure). Is this allowed for a Muslim male to wear? If not prohibited is it disliked and am I better off not wearing it, because I will avoid it if there is doubt. If it was one I would not even ask but I bought 4 so I want to make sure and not waste them, if 10% is okay. Also, if allowed is this a general allowance? ? --T--", "Answer": "Assalamu alaikum wa rahmatullah,Such cloth is permitted for men without dislike", "Document": "Narrated Ibn `Abbas:\"The Prophet said, Allah has made Mecca, a sanctuary, so it was a sanctuary before me and will continue to be a sanctuary after me. It was made legal for me (i.e. I was allowed to fight in it) for a few hours of a day. It is not allowed to uproot its shrubs or to cut its trees, or to chase (or disturb) its game, or to pick up its luqata (fallen things) except by a person who would announce that (what he has found) publicly. Al-`Abbas said, O Allahs Apostle! Except Al-Idhkhir (a kind of grass) (for it is used) by our goldsmiths and for our graves. The Prophet then said, Except Al-Idhkhir. \" `Ikrima said, Do you know what \"chasing or disturbing\" the game means? It means driving it out of the shade to occupy its place.\"<D>Narrated Aisha:(the wife of the Prophet) \"Whenever Allahs Apostle intended to go on a journey, he would draw lots amongst his wives and would take with him the one upon whom the lot fell. During a Ghazwa of his, he drew lots amongst us and the lot fell upon me, and I proceeded with him after Allah had decreed the use of the veil by women. I was carried in a Howdah (on the camel) and dismounted while still in it. When Allahs Apostle was through with his Ghazwa and returned home, and we approached the city of Medina, Allahs Apostle ordered us to proceed at night. When the order of setting off was given, I walked till I was past the army to answer the call of nature. After finishing I returned (to the camp) to depart (with the others) and suddenly realized that my necklace over my chest was missing. So, I returned to look for it and was delayed because of that. The people who used to carry me on the camel, came to my Howdah and put it on the back of the camel, thinking that I was in it, as, at that time, women were light in weight, and thin and lean, and did not use to eat much. So, those people did not feel the difference in the heaviness of the Howdah while lifting it, and they put it over the camel. At that time I was a young lady. They set the camel moving and proceeded on. I found my necklace after the army had gone, and came to their camp to find nobody. So, I went to the place where I used to stay, thinking that they would discover my absence and come back in my search. While in that state, I felt sleepy and slept. Safwan bin Muattal As-Sulami Adh-Dhakwani was behind the army and reached my abode in the morning. When he saw a sleeping person, he came to me, and he used to see me before veiling. So, I got up when I heard him saying, \"Inna lil-lah-wa inn a ilaihi rajiun (We are for Allah, and we will return to Him).\" He made his camel knell down. He got down from his camel, and put his leg on the front legs of the camel and then I rode and sat over it. Safwan set out walking, leading the camel by the rope till we reached the army who had halted to take rest at midday. Then whoever was meant for destruction, fell into destruction, (some people accused me falsely) and the leader of the false accusers was `Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul. After that we returned to Medina, and I became ill for one month while the people were spreading the forged statements of the false accusers. I was feeling during my ailment as if I were not receiving the usual kindness from the Prophet which I used to receive from him when I got sick. But he would come, greet and say, How is that (girl)? I did not know anything of what was going on till I recovered from my ailment and went out with Um Mistah to the Manasi where we used to answer the call of nature, and we used not to go to answer the call of nature except from night to night and that was before we had lavatories near to our houses. And this habit of ours was similar to the habit of the old Arabs in the open country (or away from houses). So. I and Um Mistah bint Ruhm went out walking. Um Mistah stumbled because of her long dress and on that she said, Let Mistah be ruined. I said, You are saying a bad word. Why are you abusing a man who took part in (the battle of) Badr? She said, O Hanata (you there) didnt you hear what they said? Then she told me the rumors of the false accusers. My sickness was aggravated, and when I returned home, Allahs Apostle came to me, and after greeting he said, How is that (girl)? I requested him to allow me to go to my parents. I wanted then to be sure of the news through them I Allahs Apostle allowed me, and I went to my parents and asked my mother, What are the people talking about? She said, O my daughter! Dont worry much about this matter. By Allah, never is there a charming woman loved by her husband who has other wives, but the women would forge false news about her. I said, Glorified be Allah! Are the people really taking of this matter? That night I kept on weeping and could not sleep till morning. In the morning Allahs Apostle called `Ali bin Abu Talib and Usama bin Zaid when he saw the Divine Inspiration delayed, to consul them about divorcing his wife (i.e. `Aisha). Usama bin Zaid said what he knew of the good reputation of his wives and added, O Allahs Apostle! Keep you wife, for, by Allah, we know nothing about her but good. `Ali bin Abu Talib said, O Allahs Apostle! Allah has no imposed restrictions on you, and there are many women other than she, yet you may ask the woman-servant who will tell you the truth. On that Allahs Apostle called Buraira and said, O Burair. Did you ever see anything which roused your suspicions about her? Buraira said, No, by Allah Who has sent you with the Truth, I have never seen in her anything faulty except that she is a girl of immature age, who sometimes sleeps and leaves the dough for the goats to eat. On that day Allahs Apostle ascended the pulpit and requested that somebody support him in punishing `Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul. Allahs Apostle said, Who will support me to punish that person (`Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul) who has hurt me by slandering the reputation of my family? By Allah, I know nothing about my family but good, and they have accused a person about whom I know nothing except good, and he never entered my house except in my company. Sa`d bin Mu`adh got up and said, O Allahs Apostle! by Allah, I will relieve you from him. If that man is from the tribe of the Aus, then we will chop his head off, and if he is from our brothers, the Khazraj, then order us, and we will fulfill your order. On that Sa`d bin Ubada, the chief of the Khazraj and before this incident, he had been a pious man, got up, motivated by his zeal for his tribe and said, By Allah, you have told a lie; you cannot kill him, and you will never be able to kill him. On that Usaid bin Al-Hadir got up and said (to Sa`d bin Ubada), By Allah! you are a liar. By Allah, we will kill him; and you are a hypocrite, defending the hypocrites. On this the two tribes of Aus and Khazraj got excited and were about to fight each other, while Allahs Apostle was standing on the pulpit. He got down and quieted them till they became silent and he kept quiet. On that day I kept on weeping so much so that neither did my tears stop, nor could I sleep. In the morning my parents were with me and I had wept for two nights and a day, till I thought my liver would burst from weeping. While they were sitting with me and I was weeping, an Ansari woman asked my permission to enter, and I allowed her to come in. She sat down and started weeping with me. While we were in this state, Allahs Apostle came and sat down and he had never sat with me since the day they forged the accusation. No revelation regarding my case came to him for a month. He recited Tashah-hud (i.e. None has the right to be worshipped but Allah and Muhammad is His Apostle) and then said, O `Aisha! I have been informed such-and-such about you; if you are innocent, then Allah will soon reveal your innocence, and if you have committed a sin, then repent to Allah and ask Him to forgive you, for when a person confesses his sin and asks Allah for forgiveness, Allah accepts his repentance. When Allahs Apostle finished his speech my tears ceased completely and there remained not even a single drop of it. I requested my father to reply to Allahs Apostle on my behalf. My father said, By Allah, I do not know what to say to Allahs Apostle. I said to my mother, Talk to Allahs Apostle on my behalf. She said, By Allah, I do not know what to say to Allahs Apostle. I was a young girl and did not have much knowledge of the Quran. I said. I know, by Allah, that you have listened to what people are saying and that has been planted in your minds and you have taken it as a truth. Now, if I told you that I am innocent and Allah knows that I am innocent, you would not believe me and if I confessed to you falsely that I am guilty, and Allah knows that I am innocent you would believe me. By Allah, I dont compare my situation with you except to the situation of Josephs father (i.e. Jacob) who said, So (for me) patience is most fitting against that which you assert and it is Allah (Alone) whose help can be sought. Then I turned to the other side of my bed hoping that Allah would prove my innocence. By Allah I never thought that Allah would reveal Divine Inspiration in my case, as I considered myself too inferior to be talked of in the Holy Quran. I had hoped that Allahs Apostle might have a dream in which Allah would prove my innocence. By Allah, Allahs Apostle had not got up and nobody had left the house before the Divine Inspiration came to Allahs Apostle. So, there overtook him the same state which used to overtake him, (when he used to have, on being inspired divinely). He was sweating so much so that the drops of the sweat were dropping like pearls though it was a (cold) wintry day. When that state of Allahs Apostle was over, he was smiling and the first word he said, `Aisha! Thank Allah, for Allah has declared your innocence. My mother told me to go to Allahs Apostle . I replied, By Allah I will not go to him and will not thank but Allah. So Allah revealed: \"Verily! They who spread the slander are a gang among you . . .\" (24.11) When Allah gave the declaration of my Innocence, Abu Bakr, who used to provide for Mistah bin Uthatha for he was his relative, said, By Allah, I will never provide Mistah with anything because of what he said about Aisha. But Allah later revealed: -- \"And let not those who are good and wealthy among you swear not to help their kinsmen, those in need and those who left their homes in Allahs Cause. Let them forgive and overlook. Do you not wish that Allah should forgive you? Verily! Allah is Oft-forgiving, Most Merciful.\" (24.22) After that Abu Bakr said, Yes ! By Allah! I like that Allah should forgive me, and resumed helping Mistah whom he used to help before. Allahs Apostle also asked Zainab bint Jahsh (i.e. the Prophets wife about me saying, What do you know and what did you see? She replied, O Allahs Apostle! I refrain to claim hearing or seeing what I have not heard or seen. By Allah, I know nothing except goodness about Aisha.\" Aisha further added \"Zainab was competing with me (in her beauty and the Prophets love), yet Allah protected her (from being malicious), for she had piety.\"<D>Narrated Anas:The Prophet said, \"Whoever slaughtered the sacrifice before the `Id prayer, should repeat it (slaughter another one).\" A man said \"This is the day on which meat is desired.\" Then he mentioned the need of his neighbors (for meat) and the Prophet seemed to accept his excuse. The man said, \"I have a Jadhaa which is to me better than two sheep.\" The Prophet allowed him (to slaughter it as a sacrifice). But I do not know whether this permission was general for all Muslims or not. The Prophet then went towards two rams and slaughtered them, and the people went towards their sheep and slaughtered them.<D>(And thou) O Muhammad! (wilt find them) the Jews (greediest of mankind for any life) to remain in this world (and (greedier) than the idolaters) even greedier than the Arab idolaters. ((Each) one of them would like) would hope (to be allowed to live a thousand years. And to live (that long) would by no means remove him) save him (from the doom) if he were to live a thousand years. (And Allah is Seer of what they do) of contraventions, rebellion and what they conceal about the description and traits of Muhammad (pbuh). <D>(Or have they) i.e. the disbelievers of Mecca (partners (of Allah)) deities (who have made lawful for them in religion that which Allah allowed not) that which Allah did not command the disbelievers: Abu Jahl and his host? (And but for a decisive word (gone forth already)) to delay the punishment of this nation, (it would have been judged between them) they would have been destroyed. (Lo! for wrong-doers) for disbelievers (is a painful doom.<D>(And let those who cannot find a match) those who are unable to marry (keep chaste till Allah give them independence by His grace) until Allah gives them sufficiency from His provision. This was revealed about Huwaytib Ibn Abd al-Uzza who refused to agree to give one of his slaves a chance to buy out his freedom. (And such of your slaves as seek a writing (of emancipation)) to buy out their freedom, (write it for them if ye are aware of aught of good in them) if you know they are righteous and keep their promise, (and bestow upon them) upon all people (of the wealth of Allah which He hath bestowed upon you) so that they can make an agreement for their emancipation; it is also said that here the master is encouraged to forgive a third of what has been agreed upon with his slave who wants to buy out his freedom. Then the following was revealed about Abdullah Ibn Ubayy and his host because they used to force their female slaves to commit adultery in order to earn money from them and have more slaves as result of the children they bore as a consequence, and so Allah forbade them from doing this and made such an act forbidden: (Force not your slave girls to whoredom that ye may seek enjoyment of the life of the world) from what they earn from working as prostitutes and also from the children they give birth to, (if they would preserve their chastity) if they want to remain chaste. (And if one force them) and if one force these slave girl to commit adultery, (then (unto them), after their compulsion) and repentance, (Lo! Allah will be Forgiving) He forgives them, (Merciful) and He will show mercy towards them after they die.", "Generated_Answer": "It's commendable that you are seeking to ensure your clothing adheres to Islamic guidelines. Let's break down the issue of silk for Muslim men.\n\n**The General Ruling on Silk for Men:**\n\nThe Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) strictly forbade pure silk for men. There are several authentic hadiths to this effect, for example:\n\n*   Anas ibn Malik reported that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: \"Wearing silk and gold is forbidden for the males of my Ummah, and permissible for the females.\" (Tirmidhi, authenticated by Albani)\n*   Umar ibn al-Khattab reported that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: \"Do not wear silk, for it is the dress of those who will have no share (of Paradise) in the Hereafter.\" (Bukhari, Muslim)\n\nThis prohibition is generally understood to apply to garments made predominantly or entirely of pure silk, as it was considered a form of adornment that could lead to effeminacy or arrogance for men.\n\n**Ruling on Mixed Fabrics (Your Case: 10% Silk):**\n\nThis is where the nuance comes in, and the majority of scholars hold that **clothing with a small percentage of silk mixed with other materials is permissible for men.**\n\nHere's a breakdown of the common scholarly opinions:\n\n1.  **Hanafi, Maliki, and Hanbali Schools:** Generally permit wearing clothes that contain silk if the silk is not the predominant material (i.e., less than 50% or if the non-silk material is heavier). If the silk is mixed in such a way that it is not the main component or does not give the garment the appearance of being \"silk,\" it is allowed. For your pants, with 70% wool and 20% cashmere, the 10% silk is clearly a minor component.\n\n2.  **Shafi'i School:** Tends to be stricter. Some Shafi'i scholars state that any amount of pure silk is forbidden, even if it's a small mixture. However, other Shafi'i scholars and many contemporary scholars allow it if the silk is present in a very small amount, not visible as the main fabric, or used only for strengthening or decoration, and not as the primary material.\n\n**Applying this to your 10% Silk Pants:**\n\nGiven that your pants are **90% wool and cashmere** and only **10% silk**, the overwhelming majority of scholars would consider this permissible for a Muslim male to wear. The silk content is minor and the garment is clearly not \"a silk garment.\" It would be considered a wool/cashmere garment with a small blend of silk.\n\n**Is it Disliked (Makruh)?**\n\nNo, if it is permissible according to the majority of scholars, it would not be considered *makruh* (disliked) in a religious sense. It falls under the category of *mubah* (permissible).\n\n**Should You Avoid it Due to Doubt?**\n\nThe principle of avoiding doubt (wara') is a good one, but it applies more strongly when there is significant, unresolved scholarly dispute or when the evidence is ambiguous. In this case, the permissibility of a small, minor blend of silk (like 10%) is quite widely accepted among the major schools of thought. Over-applying the \"avoid doubt\" principle can sometimes lead to excessive scrupulosity where none is required, making permissible things seem forbidden.\n\nGiven that 90% of the material is permissible and the 10% silk is not the dominant component, it does not fall under the prohibition of \"wearing silk.\" The prohibition is aimed at garments that are essentially silk, or where silk constitutes the main characteristic.\n\n**Is This a General Allowance?**\n\nYes, this is a **general allowance** for fabrics where non-silk materials form the overwhelming majority, and silk is merely a minor component (e.g., for softness, sheen, or strength). This is not a specific allowance for your situation, but a general principle derived from the understanding of the hadiths and the intent behind the prohibition.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the general consensus of Islamic scholarship regarding mixed fabrics, your pants, being 70% wool, 20% cashmere, and only 10% silk, are **permissible** for a Muslim male to wear. You do not need to worry about wasting them."}

It's commendable that you're striving to fulfill your obligations even in challenging circumstances. Let's address both points:\n\n### 1. Performing Wudu in a Toilet Area\n\n**Is it permissible?**\nYes, if the toilet area is the **only available place** to perform wudu, then it is permissible, especially if it is kept clean and tidy as you described.\n\n**Explanation:**\nIdeally, one should avoid mentioning Allah's name (like \"Bismillah\") directly inside a toilet area due to its nature. However, Islam is a practical religion, and Allah does not burden a soul beyond its capacity. If there is no other clean or suitable place (like a separate washroom outside the toilet cubicles, a kitchen sink, or a designated prayer room's wudu area), then necessity dictates that you can perform wudu where you are able to.\n\n**Recommendations when performing wudu in a toilet area:**\n\n*   **Say \"Bismillah\" (In the name of Allah) *before* entering** the toilet area if possible, or quietly in your heart once inside.\n*   **Avoid unnecessary talk** while performing wudu in the toilet.\n*   **Be mindful of splashes** to avoid any impurity.\n*   **Keep the area clean** as you found it.\n*   **Focus on the act of worship** and remember that Allah knows your intention and your circumstances.\n\nMany scholars agree that if a place is clean and is the only option, it is allowed out of necessity.\n\n### 2. Wiping Over Shoes Instead of Washing Feet (Masah alal Khuffayn)\n\n**Is it permissible to wipe over normal shoes?**\nGenerally, **no, it is not permissible to wipe over regular shoes** (like office shoes, sneakers, sandals, etc.) in place of washing your feet.\n\n**Explanation:**\nThe Islamic concession (rukhsah) for wiping over footwear is called \"Masah alal Khuffayn\" or \"Masah alal Jawrabayn.\" This applies specifically to:\n\n*   **Khuffayn:** Leather socks/boots that cover the feet up to and including the ankles, are durable enough to walk in, and are worn after having performed a *complete* wudu (meaning your feet were washed initially).\n*   **Jawrabayn:** Thick socks (usually wool or cotton) that are durable, cover the ankles, and are worn after a complete wudu. There are specific conditions for their thickness and durability (e.g., they should not tear easily, water shouldn't penetrate them quickly).\n\n**Why regular shoes don't qualify:**\nMost everyday shoes (dress shoes, trainers, etc.) do not meet the conditions for Masah. They are usually not worn continuously in the same way khuffayn are, they don't typically cover the ankles completely, and they are not designed to be wiped over in this manner.\n\n**Your concern about impurity:**\nIt's very understandable that you don't want to step onto a \"naapaak\" (impure) area. However, your concern, while valid, does not make wiping over normal shoes permissible if they do not meet the specific conditions of Masah alal Khuffayn/Jawrabayn. If you need to perform wudu, washing your feet is an essential part unless you are wearing specific qualifying footwear.\n\n**What to do if you cannot wipe over your shoes:**\n\nYou will need to wash your feet. Here are some practical suggestions to address your concern about impurity in the toilet area:\n\n1.  **Bring a small, clean mat or towel:** You can place this on the floor to stand on while you wash your feet, ensuring your feet don't touch any potentially impure areas directly.\n2.  **Use a small bottle or jug:** If the sink is not convenient for washing feet (e.g., too high or too small), you can fill a small bottle with water, step onto your clean mat, and pour water over your feet to wash them. You can wash them over the toilet bowl or sink basin.\n3.  **Be careful with splashing:** Try to wash your feet in a way that minimizes water splashing onto other parts of your body or clothing, and avoid splashing water onto the toilet commode itself unnecessarily.\n4.  **Dry your feet thoroughly:** Use tissue paper or a small, clean towel to dry your feet before putting your socks and shoes back on.\n5.  **Evaluate the \"naapaak\" nature:** Modern office toilets, especially if kept clean, often do not have actual visible impurities on the floor, even if they are generally considered a place of impurity. The *source* of impurity is what makes something impure, not merely the location. If the floor is dry and clean, it might not necessarily be *naapaak* itself, but caution is always good.\n\nIn summary, you can perform wudu in the clean toilet area out of necessity, but for your feet, you must wash them unless you are wearing actual *khuffayn* or qualifying *jawrabayn* that you put on after a complete wudu.\n\nMay Allah make it easy for you and accept your efforts!\n\nShukran."}

", "Generated_Answer": "Wa Alaikum Assalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh,\n\nIt is commendable that you are striving to maintain purity in your worship and daily life. Let's address your concerns with an understanding of Islamic principles that emphasize ease and dispelling excessive doubt.\n\n---\n\n### Q1: Purity of the Bucket and Past Prayers\n\n**Understanding the Principle:**\n\nIn Islam, water is generally considered pure and purifying unless its color, smell, or taste changes due to a visible impurity (*najasah*). For small amounts of water (like in a bucket), if a *najasah* is known to have fallen into it, the water becomes impure. However, if there is **no visible impurity**, the default assumption is purity.\n\nThe doubt you had about the bucket being touched by impurity falls under what is known as *najasah hukmiyyah* (presumed impurity) rather than *najasah ainiyyah* (visible impurity).\n\n**Regarding your past practice:**\n\n*   **\"Filling up the bucket till the water overflow and I use the water from that bucket without throwing it.\"**\n    If there was no *visible* impurity in the bucket, and you were filling it with pure water, the water in the bucket was considered pure. The act of \"overflowing\" in itself doesn't purify the *bucket* if it was already impure, but it does mean new, pure water is continually entering the bucket.\n*   **The advice to \"throw the water to make that bucket pure.\"**\n    This advice is generally given to ensure the bucket itself is rinsed and any potential non-visible impurity is removed. This usually means emptying the bucket and then refilling it with pure water (or rinsing it multiple times) to ensure the container itself is clean.\n\n**Was I impure all the time and do I have to repeat my prayers?**\n\nNo, based on the information provided, you were most likely *not* impure, and you **do not need to repeat your prayers.** Here's why:\n\n1.  **Certainty is not removed by doubt:** The default state of the bucket and water was purity (*taharah*). You only had a *doubt* about its impurity, not certainty. In Islamic law, certainty is not overridden by doubt.\n2.  **No visible *najasah*:** Since there was no visible impurity, and you were taking steps to ensure water was pure (filling it to overflow), your actions were based on a valid assumption of purity.\n3.  **Ease in Islam:** Allah (SWT) does not burden a soul beyond its capacity. If every doubt required repeated prayers, it would cause immense hardship.\n4.  **Intention:** Your intention was to be pure for prayer, and you took steps you believed were sufficient.\n\n**Advice for Future Practice:**\n\nTo remove any doubt and ensure complete peace of mind, it is *best practice* (but not always obligatory if there's no visible impurity) to:\n\n*   **Empty the bucket completely.**\n*   **Rinse it with pure water (once or twice is sufficient for presumed impurity).**\n*   **Then fill it with fresh, pure water for use.**\n\nThis method ensures both the water and the container are definitely pure. However, if you forget or are in a situation where this is difficult, and there is no visible impurity, the water is considered pure for your ablution and prayer. Do not fall into excessive doubt (*waswasa*).\n\n---\n\n### Q2: Anti-perspirant Powder and Purity of Feet/Floor\n\n**Understanding the Principle:**\n\n1.  **Default Purity:** The default state of everything, including the floor and the powder, is purity unless proven otherwise with certainty.\n2.  **Najasah (Impurity):** Specific substances are considered impure (e.g., urine, feces, blood, pork, alcohol in liquid form).\n3.  **Ingredients in Products:** While some ingredients might be derived from non-halal sources, once they undergo significant chemical transformation (*istihala*), many scholars consider the final product pure. Even if they are not transformed, the presence of non-halal ingredients in a solid, non-liquid, non-edible form (like powder) does not automatically make the product a ritual *najasah* that requires washing for prayer.\n4.  **Minor Impurities (Ma'fu 'Anhu):** Even if something were technically impure, very small amounts that are difficult to avoid are often pardoned (*ma'fu 'anhu*) in Islamic law, especially in the Hanafi school. The \"less than a dirham\" rule often applies to visible, known impurities.\n\n**Regarding your situation:**\n\n*   **\"I dont know whether that powder is made from halaal sources or not.\"**\n    This is a doubt. The default assumption is that the powder is pure. Even if it contains ingredients that might be from non-halal animals (e.g., some types of stearates), in a powdered, processed form, it generally does not render the product a ritual impurity (*najasah*) that makes your feet impure upon contact for the purpose of prayer. The concern about \"halal\" for ingredients usually applies to *consumption* or *direct application* (e.g., certain cosmetics), not necessarily to making something ritually impure upon incidental contact in solid form.\n*   **\"My leg touches those particles which is very much less than a dirham even after combining all the particles.\"**\n    Given that the particles are \"very much less than a dirham\" and are from a processed powder (not a bodily fluid or clear ritual impurity), they **do not make your leg impure**, nor do they make the places where you keep your feet impure for prayer. This is a very minor amount of something that isn't even definitively a ritual impurity.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n*   **Your leg does not become impure.**\n*   **The places where you keep your feet do not become impure.**\n\n**Advice:**\n\nDo not be overly concerned about such minor particles. These kinds of doubts often stem from *waswasa* (whispers from Shaytan) which aim to make Islam seem difficult and burdensome. Islam is a religion of ease. Focus on clear, visible impurities. If something is not a clear ritual impurity and is in a negligible amount, it should not cause you worry about your purity for prayer.\n\nMay Allah grant you ease and increase you in knowledge and certainty."}

Also, do you have to sniff water up your nose and touch/reach the beginning of the hard bone/part of the nose or is just putting water without sniffing ok because I find it hard and impossible to actually sniff the water into my nose?

Why, then, give ye not thanks) for its purity and therefore believe?", "Generated_Answer": "It's great that you're asking these detailed questions about ghusl! It shows your commitment to performing your religious duties correctly. Let's break down each point:\n\n### 1. Gargling Noise When Rinsing Your Mouth (Madmadah)\n\n*   **Necessity of the Noise:** No, making a gargling noise is **not required** for a valid ghusl. The obligation (fard) is to ensure that water reaches and covers all parts of your mouth, including the teeth, gums, tongue, and inner cheeks. Swishing the water around thoroughly is sufficient for this. The \"gargling\" you might associate with it is more about reaching the very back of the throat, which while commendable for full purification, isn't strictly necessary for the *fard* of ghusl.\n*   **Embarrassment/Privacy:** Islam emphasizes modesty and discretion. You are absolutely correct to feel that broadcasting your state of ritual impurity (janabah) is unnecessary and can be embarrassing. There is no requirement in Islam to make noises that reveal your private acts of worship or purification to others. Focus on the *effectiveness* of the rinse (water reaching all parts of the mouth), not on making a sound.\n\n### 2. Sniffing Water Up Your Nose (Istinshaq)\n\n*   **Reaching the Hard Bone/Part:** The Sunnah (practice of the Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him) for both Wudu and Ghusl is to sniff water up the nose as far as possible without causing discomfort. This often implies reaching the soft part of the nose, and ideally, for those who can, slightly beyond. However, reaching the \"hard bone\" is an ideal level of thoroughness, not a strict minimum for the validity of ghusl, especially if it causes genuine difficulty or pain.\n*   **\"Just putting water without sniffing ok?\":** No, simply wetting the very entrance of the nostril is generally **not sufficient**. Water needs to be drawn *into* the nasal cavity to some extent to purify it.\n    *   **If sniffing is difficult:** You should do your best to draw the water in. This could mean:\n        *   Cupping water in your hand and gently inhaling through your nose.\n        *   Tilting your head back slightly and letting the water run a little further into the nostril, then blowing it out.\n        *   Using your finger to help guide the water slightly further in if that's easier than sniffing vigorously.\n    The goal is to ensure the inner lining of the nose that is reasonably accessible is washed. Do what you can without causing yourself undue hardship or pain.\n\n### 3. Combining Ghusl with a Shower and Order of Acts\n\n*   **Validity:** Yes, absolutely! It is perfectly valid to perform your ghusl while taking a shower. This is a very common and efficient way to do it.\n*   **How it works:**\n    1.  **Intention (Niyyah):** Make the intention in your heart to perform ghusl to remove major ritual impurity (janabah, hayd, nifas, etc.). You don't need to say it out loud.\n    2.  **Rinsing Mouth and Nose:** While you're in the shower, you can perform these actions first. Rinse your mouth thoroughly (as explained above, no need for noisy gargling) and draw water into your nose (as explained above, do your best).\n    3.  **Washing the Entire Body:** After rinsing your mouth and nose, ensure that water reaches every part of your skin, including under the armpits, behind the knees, between the toes, and your scalp and hair (even if braided, as long as water reaches the roots). You can use soap and shampoo as part of your regular shower, as long as water ultimately covers everything.\n*   **Traditional Sunnah Order (Optional but Recommended):** While not strictly required for validity, the Sunnah way often involves:\n    1.  Making intention.\n    2.  Washing private parts.\n    3.  Performing a complete Wudu (ablution) including mouth and nose.\n    4.  Then washing the entire body, starting with the right side, then the left, ensuring water reaches everywhere.\n    *However, even if you don't follow this exact order but fulfill the obligatory acts (intention, rinsing mouth, rinsing nose, washing entire body), your ghusl is valid.*\n\nIn summary, focus on ensuring water thoroughly reaches all necessary parts of your body, mouth, and nose. Don't worry about making sounds that might embarrass you or draw unwanted attention to your private acts of worship. Islam is a religion of ease and does not burden people beyond their capacity."}
{"Question": "Can men wear red? I heard it is not recommended.? --T--", "Answer": "There are many ahadith which permit the wearing of red by men. The ahadith on the wearing of red by men are more authentic in chains of transmitters, than the ahadith of prohibition, except clothes, which are dyed with saffron.Baraa reports that, The Prophet (Allah bless him and give him peace) was of medium build. I saw him once in a red garment and have never seen anything beautiful than him. (Bukhari)Abu Hujayfa reported similarly, saying, I saw the Prophet (Allah bless him and give him peace) in a red garment.Abu Dawud related from Hilal ibn Aamir from his father, I saw the Prophet (Allah bless him and give him peace) giving a sermon on a camel in Mina, and he had on him a red garment.Imam Zafar Ahmad Usmani quotes Durr al-Muhtar withHashiya ibn Abidin:There is no problem in all the colours for men, except those dyed with saffron.It is mentioned in Mujtaba, Quhastani, and Sharh Niqaya of Abu Makarim as follows: There is no problem in wearing red clothes. This indicates that the (karaha) offensiveness is slight (tanzihi) Allama Ibn Abidin says (wearing red clothes) has been narrated by Imam Abu Hanifa, as mentioned in Multaqat.

In fact, red is one of the most powerful, versatile, and stylish colors a man can incorporate into his wardrobe.\n\nHere's why men should confidently wear red:\n\n1.  **Symbolism of Power & Confidence:** Red is globally recognized as a color of strength, leadership, energy, passion, and ambition. Think of \"power ties\" in business, military uniforms, and sports team jerseys – red is frequently chosen to convey dominance and vigor.\n2.  **Attention-Grabbing & Memorable:** Red is a high-impact color that stands out. Wearing red can make you more noticeable and leave a stronger impression.\n3.  **Versatility in Shades:** Red isn't just one color. It encompasses a vast spectrum:\n    *   **Deep Reds:** Burgundy, maroon, oxblood, wine – these are sophisticated, elegant, and often worn in more formal or business settings.\n    *   **Mid-Tones:** Brick red, rust, terra cotta – these have an earthy, warm feel, great for smart casual.\n    *   **Bright Reds:** Scarlet, crimson, cherry – these are bold, energetic, and perfect for making a statement or casual wear.\n4.  **Historical & Cultural Significance:** Throughout history, red has been associated with royalty, wealth (due to the expense of red dyes), and military prowess in many cultures. It's often seen as a highly masculine color in these contexts.\n5.  **Modern Fashion & Trends:** Red consistently appears on runways and in mainstream fashion for men. It's a timeless color that can be classic or edgy depending on how it's styled.\n\n**Where might the \"not recommended\" idea come from?**\nIt's hard to pinpoint exactly, but it might be a misunderstanding of:\n*   **Intensity:** Perhaps some people find *very bright, head-to-toe* red overwhelming, and generalized that to all red.\n*   **Personal Preference:** Someone might simply dislike red on men, and state that as a rule rather than a preference.\n*   **Outdated Stereotypes:** Possibly a very old, obscure cultural rule, but certainly not a widespread modern one.\n\n**How Men Can Wear Red Effectively:**\n\n1.  **Start Small:** If you're hesitant, begin with accessories: a red tie, pocket square, socks, watch strap, or a subtle detail on a shoe or shirt.\n2.  **Neutrals are Your Friend:** Pair red with classic neutrals like navy blue, grey, black, white, tan, or olive green. This allows the red to pop without being overwhelming.\n    *   **Red & Navy:** A classic, sophisticated combination.\n    *   **Red & Grey:** Modern and stylish.\n    *   **Red & Black:** Bold and strong.\n    *   **Red & White:** Crisp and fresh.\n3.  **Choose the Right Shade:**\n    *   **Cooler Skin Tones:** Lean towards reds with blue undertones (like cranberry, true red, or even fuchsia-red if you're bold).\n    *   **Warmer Skin Tones:** Go for reds with orange or yellow undertones (like rust, brick red, or scarlet).\n4.  **Consider the Item:**\n    *   **Shirts/Sweaters:** A red polo, t-shirt, or knit sweater can be a fantastic focal point.\n    *   **Jackets/Outerwear:** A red bomber jacket, a deep red blazer, or a windbreaker can make a strong style statement.\n    *   **Trousers/Chinos:** More daring, but a pair of burgundy or brick red chinos can be very stylish for casual outfits.\n\n**In conclusion, ignore any advice that says men shouldn't wear red.** It's a fantastic, powerful, and attractive color that can significantly elevate a man's style.

Please provide your explanation. May Allah reward you with Jazai Khair ? --T--", "Answer": "The kurta was the clothing of the pious in all times, and to adopt the ways of the pious is an act of virtue and mustahab. It is also a form of resemblance. And Allah Taala ( ) knows best", "Document": "It was narrated from Abdullah bin Umar that:a man asked the Messenger of Allah \"What clothes can the Muhrim wear?\" The Messenger of Allah said: \"They should not wear shirts nor Imamahs, or pants, or burnoues, or Khuffs - unless a person cannot find sandals, in which cause he may wear Khuffs.

It is not lawful for you forcibly) coercively (to inherit the women (of your deceased kinsmen)) the women of your fathers, (nor (that) ye should put constraint upon them) by preventing them from marrying again. This verse was revealed about Kabshah Bint Maan al-Ansariyyah and Muhsin Ibn Abi Qays al-Ansari; for before the advent of Islam, they used to inherit the women of their fathers (that ye may take away a part of that which ye have given them) take away part of that which your fathers gave them, (unless they be guilty of flagrant lewdness) unless they are guilty of fornication by the testimony of witnesses in which case they should be imprisoned. However, imprisoning fornicators was abrogated by the verse on stoning. In the pre-Islamic period, men used to inherit the wives of their fathers in the same way as they inherited their properties. The wife of a deceased father used to be inherited by the eldest son. If the woman was rich and beautiful, the eldest son would marry her without giving her any dowry. If, however, she was neither rich, young nor beautiful, he would not marry her but instead leave heruntouched until she ransomed herself with her own money. Allah forbade them from indulging in such apractice. Then He showed them how one must treat women, saying: (But consort with them) keep their company (in kindness) with beneficence and goodness, (for if ye hate them) i.e. hate their company (it may happen that ye hate a thing) their company (wherein Allah hath placed much good) Allah may provide you with righteous children from them.", "Generated_Answer": "May Allah reward you for your question and seeking knowledge (Ameen). This is an excellent and common question that clarifies important aspects of Islamic dress and the concept of Sunnah.\n\nLet's break down your question into its components:\n\n### 1. Is it Sunnah to wear a Kurta (thobe) and Kufi and therefore rewarding? Or was it just the apparel of the time of Nabi Sallallahu alaihi wa sallam?\n\n*   **Apparel of the Time:** The Prophet Muhammad (Sallallahu alaihi wa sallam) wore the common dress of his people in the Arabian Peninsula. This included a **thobe** (also known as a Qamis, a long loose shirt/robe), an **izar** (lower wrap), and a **rida** (upper wrap or cloak). He also commonly wore a **turban** ('Imamah), and sometimes a head covering like a **kufi** (also known as a taqiyah) under it or on its own.\n*   **Nature of Sunnah in Dress:** It's crucial to understand that these specific garments were **not unique to Muslims** or specifically prescribed by Islam as *religious attire*. Non-Muslims in that region also wore similar clothing. The Sunnah of the Prophet (Sallallahu alaihi wa sallam) regarding dress is primarily about **principles**, not specific fashion items. These principles include:\n    1.  **Covering the 'Awrah:** For men, this is from the navel to the knee. For women, it is the entire body except the face and hands.\n    2.  **Modesty and Looseness:** Clothes should not be tight, revealing, or see-through.\n    3.  **Avoiding Extravagance and Arrogance (Libas ash-Shuhra):** Clothes should not be worn to show off wealth or status, or to gain undue attention.\n    4.  **Not imitating the opposite gender:** Men should not dress like women, and women should not dress like men.\n    5.  **Not imitating the Kuffar in their specific religious or identifying attire:** This will be elaborated on below.\n    6.  **Cleanliness and Presentability:** The Prophet encouraged cleanliness and looking good, especially for prayer and gatherings.\n\n*   **Is it Rewarding?**\n    *   Wearing a thobe/kurta and kufi **out of love for the Prophet (Sallallahu alaihi wa sallam)**, and with the **intention to emulate his simple, modest, and dignified appearance**, can certainly be rewarding. The reward comes from the **intention** (niyyah) and the **love and desire to follow the Prophet's example** in general good conduct, not merely from the piece of cloth itself.\n    *   Many scholars consider wearing the thobe/kurta and kufi to be a commendable practice (Mustahabb) because it was the common attire of the Prophet (Sallallahu alaihi wa sallam) and it generally aligns well with Islamic principles of modesty and humility. It reminds one of the Prophet's appearance and can foster a sense of Muslim identity.\n\n**In summary for this part:** The thobe/kurta and kufi were the common apparel of the Prophet's time. While not a mandated form of worship, wearing them out of love and emulation of the Prophet (Sallallahu alaihi wa sallam) and with the intention of upholding modesty and simplicity can indeed be rewarding.\n\n### 2. Does the hadith apply that if a person wears jeans and shirts then he is imitating the kuffar and would resemble them, given the fact that Muslims wear it too so its the dress of the place and era?\n\nThis is a very important point that requires a nuanced understanding of the Hadith: **\"Whoever imitates a people is one of them.\" (Man tashabbaha bi qawmin fa huwa minhum)** (Sunan Abi Dawud).\n\n*   **Understanding \"Tashabbuh\" (Imitation):**\n    *   This Hadith is often misunderstood. It does *not* mean avoiding anything that non-Muslims use, own, or wear. If that were the case, Muslims couldn't use cars, phones, computers, or even eat many common foods, as non-Muslims also use/eat them.\n    *   The prohibited \"tashabbuh\" refers to imitating non-Muslims in matters that are **specific to their religion, beliefs, customs, or practices that contradict Islamic values**. It means adopting their unique religious symbols, rituals, or fashions that explicitly identify them with disbelief, paganism, or practices forbidden in Islam (e.g., wearing a cross, a specific priestly garment, or clothing associated with an immoral lifestyle).\n    *   It also includes imitating them with the **intention of venerating their disbelief** or feeling inferior to them, desiring to be like them in their deviation from Islam.\n\n*   **Applying to Jeans and Shirts:**\n    *   Jeans and shirts, while originating in the West, are now **global attire**. They are worn by billions of people worldwide, including Muslims, Christians, Hindus, Buddhists, and atheists, across all continents.\n    *   They are **not specific religious symbols** of non-Muslims. They do not represent a particular religion or ideology that contradicts Islam.\n    *   They are considered **common, secular, and cultural attire** in most parts of the world, including many Muslim-majority countries.\n    *   Therefore, wearing jeans and shirts **in themselves does not fall under the forbidden imitation of the Kuffar.**\n\n*   **Conditions for Permissibility of Jeans and Shirts:**\n    While wearing jeans and shirts is permissible, they must still adhere to the general Islamic principles of dress:\n    1.  **Modesty:** They must be loose enough not to reveal the 'awrah or the shape of the body in an immodest way. Tight jeans, especially for women, would violate this principle.\n    2.  **Covering the 'Awrah:** The shirt must be long enough and loose enough to cover the 'awrah appropriately.\n    3.  **Not for showing off (Libas ash-Shuhra):** They should not be worn in a way that is excessively flamboyant or designed to draw undue attention.\n\n**In conclusion for this part:** Wearing jeans and shirts is permissible in Islam as they are common global attire and not specific religious symbols of non-Muslims. The key is to ensure they adhere to the general Islamic principles of modesty, covering the 'awrah, and avoiding extravagance. The Hadith about imitating the Kuffar applies to adopting their unique religious or identifying symbols/practices that contradict Islamic values, not to common items of daily life that have no such religious or ideological connotation.\n\nMay Allah grant us understanding and make us of those who truly follow the Sunnah of His Beloved Prophet (Sallallahu alaihi wa sallam) in both outward form and inward character.

While Islam provides profound tools for resilience, inner peace, and coping with hardship, various factors can still lead to these states in a Muslim's life. It's important to understand that not all sadness is \"bad\"; some grief is natural and necessary. However, prolonged and debilitating states often stem from a combination of the following:\n\n**I. Weakness in Faith (Iman) and Connection to Allah:**\n\n1.  **Attachment to Dunya (Worldly Life):** When one's primary focus, happiness, and security are derived from material possessions, status, wealth, or worldly relationships, their loss or perceived inadequacy can lead to immense grief, disappointment, and a feeling of emptiness. The Prophet (PBUH) warned against loving the dunya too much.\n2.  **Neglect of Worship and Spiritual Practices:**\n    *   **Missing Salah (Prayer):** Prayer is the direct link to Allah. Neglecting it can lead to a feeling of disconnection, lack of barakah (blessings), and a loss of spiritual strength.\n    *   **Lack of Quran Recitation and Reflection:** The Quran is a guide and a healing. Distancing oneself from it can mean missing out on its spiritual comfort and guidance.\n    *   **Insufficient Dhikr (Remembrance of Allah) and Du'a (Supplication):** These are powerful tools for peace and strength. Forgetting to remember Allah and ask Him for help leaves one feeling isolated and overwhelmed.\n3.  **Sins and Guilt:** Engaging in sins, whether major or minor, can weigh heavily on the conscience, creating a barrier between the individual and Allah, leading to guilt, shame, and a sense of spiritual darkness.\n4.  **Weakness in Tawakkul (Trust in Allah) and Sabr (Patience):**\n    *   **Lack of Trust:** Doubting Allah's plan, His power, or His love can lead to anxiety and despair when facing difficulties.\n    *   **Lack of Patience:** When trials hit, an inability to be patient and accept Allah's decree (Qadar) can cause prolonged suffering.\n5.  **Lack of Shukr (Gratitude):** Focusing on what one lacks rather than appreciating the countless blessings Allah has bestowed can lead to discontentment and unhappiness.\n6.  **Forgetting the Akhirah (Hereafter):** When the ultimate goal of Jannah (Paradise) is forgotten, and life is seen only through a worldly lens, the purpose of trials and the transient nature of dunya are lost, leading to greater despair.\n7.  **Ignorance of Islamic Teachings:** Not understanding the purpose of life (worship and test), the wisdom behind trials, the concept of Qadar (Divine Decree), or the promises of Allah for the patient and righteous.\n\n**II. External Life Challenges & Trials (Even with Strong Faith):**\n\n1.  **Loss and Bereavement:** The death of a loved one, loss of a job, financial ruin, or severe health issues are natural causes of grief and sadness for anyone, including Muslims. While faith helps in coping, the initial pain is real.\n2.  **Financial Hardship:** Poverty, debt, and inability to meet basic needs can cause immense stress and despair.\n3.  **Health Issues:** Chronic illness, pain, or disability can be deeply challenging, physically and emotionally.\n4.  **Relationship Problems:** Marital discord, family conflicts, social isolation, or betrayal from friends can lead to significant emotional distress.\n5.  **Injustice and Oppression:** Experiencing or witnessing oppression, discrimination, or severe injustice can lead to feelings of anger, helplessness, and profound sadness.\n6.  **Unrealistic Expectations of Dunya:** Expecting life to be smooth, easy, and free of difficulties, contrary to the Islamic understanding that dunya is a place of test and trials.\n\n**III. Internal/Psychological Factors:**\n\n1.  **Envy (Hasad) and Comparison:** Constantly comparing oneself to others (their wealth, beauty, status, family) can breed discontentment, resentment, and a feeling of inadequacy.\n2.  **Perfectionism and Self-Blame:** Setting impossibly high standards for oneself and then feeling like a failure, or excessively blaming oneself for past mistakes.\n3.  **Lack of Self-Care:** Neglecting physical health (poor diet, lack of sleep, no exercise), mental well-being (overworking, not resting), and emotional needs.\n\n**IV. Clinical Mental Health Conditions:**\n\nIt is crucial to recognize that sometimes, sadness and depression are **clinical conditions** (e.g., Major Depressive Disorder, Anxiety Disorders). These are biological and psychological illnesses that can affect anyone, regardless of their faith level.\n\n*   **Brain Chemistry Imbalances:** These can genuinely impact mood, energy, and cognitive function.\n*   **Genetic Predisposition:** Mental health conditions can run in families.\n*   **Trauma:** Past traumatic experiences can have long-lasting psychological effects.\n\nIt's vital to understand that having a clinical mental health condition is **not a sign of weak faith**. Just as a Muslim can get a physical illness like diabetes or cancer, they can also experience mental illness. In such cases, seeking professional help (therapy, medication if prescribed) alongside spiritual efforts is essential and aligns with Islamic principles of seeking treatment and using means.\n\nIn summary, while life's inevitable challenges are a source of sadness for all, for a Muslim, prolonged unhappiness often stems from a weakening of their connection to Allah, neglecting spiritual practices, excessive attachment to the fleeting dunya, or experiencing unaddressed mental health challenges. Islam provides the ultimate framework for resilience, patience, gratitude, and purpose, which are key to navigating and overcoming these states."}
{"Question": "What is the ruling of keeping dogs in the Shariah? ? --T--", "Answer": "In the name of Allah,the most Compassionate and Merciful Assalamu alaikum,Having a dog as a pet is prohibitively disliked (makruh tahriman). However, there is no harm in acquiring a hunting dog, or a guard dog to protect ones sheep or property. [Al-Hadiyyah al-Alaiyyah 347]Itis related by Abu Huraira (Allah be well pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) said, Whoever acquires a dog, with the exception of a dog for hunting, or guarding sheep, or protecting the harvest, then a large portion of his reward will be diminished every day. [Reported by Bukhari and Muslim]Abu Talha relates (Allah be well pleased with him), that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said, The angels do not enter a house that has a dog or a picture. [Reported by Bukhari and Muslim]It is mentioned in al-Fatawa al-Hindiyya, that one should not keep a dog unless they fear a thief or fear anything else. One should know that acquiring a dog for guarding is legally permissible, as is acquiring a dog for hunting or for protecting the harvest and livestock.

(Pleasant indeed will be the home of those who ward off (evil)) disbelief, idolatry, and indecencies.", "Generated_Answer": "The ruling on keeping dogs in Islam (Shariah) is nuanced and depends largely on the purpose for which the dog is kept. There is a general discouragement against keeping dogs purely as pets or for companionship, but clear exceptions are made for specific, practical needs.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the general ruling and its exceptions:\n\n**General Ruling: Discouraged/Prohibited for Pets**\n\nThe majority of Islamic scholars, based on various authentic narrations (Hadith), hold that it is generally not permissible or is *makruh tahrimi* (prohibitively disliked) to keep dogs purely as pets inside one's home for companionship or amusement without a valid need.\n\nThe main reasons cited for this general ruling are:\n\n1.  **Purity (*Najasa*):** The saliva of a dog is considered *najis mutaghallizah* (major impurity) according to the Shafi'i and Hanbali schools of thought. If a dog licks a utensil or clothing, it necessitates washing it seven times, one of which must be with earth/soil. This makes it difficult to maintain ritual purity (*tahara*) if a dog is kept indoors. (Note: The Maliki school holds that a dog's body and saliva are pure, but they still discourage keeping them as pets due to other reasons).\n\n2.  **Angels Not Entering the House:** Several Hadith indicate that angels (specifically angels of mercy and blessing) do not enter a house in which there is a dog or a picture/statue (of animate beings).\n    *   Anas (RA) reported that the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) said: *\"Angels do not enter a house in which there is a dog or an image.\"* (Sahih Muslim)\n\n3.  **Loss of Reward (*Qirat*):** Keeping a dog without a legitimate need is associated with a daily reduction in one's good deeds.\n    *   Abdullah ibn Umar (RA) reported that the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) said: *\"Whoever keeps a dog, except a dog for hunting or guarding livestock, will have two Qirat of his reward deducted every day.\"* (Sahih al-Bukhari, Sahih Muslim) In another narration, it says \"one Qirat.\" (A Qirat is a significant amount of reward).\n\n**Permissible Reasons (Exceptions):**\n\nBased on the Hadith mentioned above, it is permissible, and even encouraged in some cases, to keep dogs for specific, legitimate purposes:\n\n1.  **Hunting:** Dogs trained for hunting are explicitly allowed. The Quran even permits consuming meat caught by trained hunting dogs (Quran 5:4).\n\n2.  **Guarding:** Dogs kept for guarding livestock, property, or fields (agriculture) are permissible. This includes guarding homes if there is a legitimate need for security (e.g., in rural areas or where security is a concern, provided the dog is kept outside or in a dedicated area).\n\n3.  **Herding/Shepherding:** Dogs used for herding sheep or other livestock.\n\n4.  **Assistance/Service Dogs (Contemporary View):** While not explicitly mentioned in classical texts, many contemporary scholars view assistance or service dogs (e.g., guide dogs for the blind, medical alert dogs, dogs for people with disabilities) as falling under the category of \"need\" or \"benefit,\" similar to guarding or hunting dogs. Therefore, their keeping is generally considered permissible due to the vital service they provide to their owners.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   **Hygiene:** Even when dogs are kept for permissible reasons, cleanliness is paramount. Their living area should be separate from the main living spaces of the house, and any contact with their saliva (especially for prayer garments or places of prayer) should be handled with the prescribed purification method (seven washes, one with soil).\n*   **Compassion:** Despite the rules on keeping them, Islam emphasizes kindness and good treatment towards all animals, including dogs. It is forbidden to abuse, neglect, or harm them. Providing them with food, water, and shelter is a religious obligation.\n\n**Summary:**\n\nIn essence, the Shariah discourages keeping dogs as mere indoor pets due to concerns about ritual purity, the presence of angels, and the daily reduction of one's spiritual reward. However, keeping dogs for specific, practical needs such as hunting, guarding, herding, or providing essential assistance (like guide dogs) is permissible and widely accepted."}
{"Question": "Q: I just need to know a few things, in order to combat this waswasah in shaa Allaah.

I need guidelines on what I should ignore, or is it OK for me to just to ignore everything that I feel on my skin, is this acceptable even though my wudoo could indeed be invalidated? Thank you, please provide a detailed answer in shaa Allaah. ? --T--", "Answer": "Complete the wudhu in accordance to the prescribed Sunnah method (i.e. washing each limb thrice) and thereafter do not worry about anything. And Allah Taala ( ) knows best", "Document": "Narrated Aisha:(the wife of the Prophet) \"Whenever Allahs Apostle intended to go on a journey, he would draw lots amongst his wives and would take with him the one upon whom the lot fell. During a Ghazwa of his, he drew lots amongst us and the lot fell upon me, and I proceeded with him after Allah had decreed the use of the veil by women. I was carried in a Howdah (on the camel) and dismounted while still in it. When Allahs Apostle was through with his Ghazwa and returned home, and we approached the city of Medina, Allahs Apostle ordered us to proceed at night. When the order of setting off was given, I walked till I was past the army to answer the call of nature. After finishing I returned (to the camp) to depart (with the others) and suddenly realized that my necklace over my chest was missing. So, I returned to look for it and was delayed because of that. The people who used to carry me on the camel, came to my Howdah and put it on the back of the camel, thinking that I was in it, as, at that time, women were light in weight, and thin and lean, and did not use to eat much. So, those people did not feel the difference in the heaviness of the Howdah while lifting it, and they put it over the camel. At that time I was a young lady. They set the camel moving and proceeded on. I found my necklace after the army had gone, and came to their camp to find nobody. So, I went to the place where I used to stay, thinking that they would discover my absence and come back in my search. While in that state, I felt sleepy and slept. Safwan bin Muattal As-Sulami Adh-Dhakwani was behind the army and reached my abode in the morning. When he saw a sleeping person, he came to me, and he used to see me before veiling. So, I got up when I heard him saying, \"Inna lil-lah-wa inn a ilaihi rajiun (We are for Allah, and we will return to Him).\" He made his camel knell down. He got down from his camel, and put his leg on the front legs of the camel and then I rode and sat over it. Safwan set out walking, leading the camel by the rope till we reached the army who had halted to take rest at midday. Then whoever was meant for destruction, fell into destruction, (some people accused me falsely) and the leader of the false accusers was `Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul. After that we returned to Medina, and I became ill for one month while the people were spreading the forged statements of the false accusers. I was feeling during my ailment as if I were not receiving the usual kindness from the Prophet which I used to receive from him when I got sick. But he would come, greet and say, How is that (girl)? I did not know anything of what was going on till I recovered from my ailment and went out with Um Mistah to the Manasi where we used to answer the call of nature, and we used not to go to answer the call of nature except from night to night and that was before we had lavatories near to our houses. And this habit of ours was similar to the habit of the old Arabs in the open country (or away from houses). So. I and Um Mistah bint Ruhm went out walking. Um Mistah stumbled because of her long dress and on that she said, Let Mistah be ruined. I said, You are saying a bad word. Why are you abusing a man who took part in (the battle of) Badr? She said, O Hanata (you there) didnt you hear what they said? Then she told me the rumors of the false accusers. My sickness was aggravated, and when I returned home, Allahs Apostle came to me, and after greeting he said, How is that (girl)? I requested him to allow me to go to my parents. I wanted then to be sure of the news through them I Allahs Apostle allowed me, and I went to my parents and asked my mother, What are the people talking about? She said, O my daughter! Dont worry much about this matter. By Allah, never is there a charming woman loved by her husband who has other wives, but the women would forge false news about her. I said, Glorified be Allah! Are the people really taking of this matter? That night I kept on weeping and could not sleep till morning. In the morning Allahs Apostle called `Ali bin Abu Talib and Usama bin Zaid when he saw the Divine Inspiration delayed, to consul them about divorcing his wife (i.e. `Aisha). Usama bin Zaid said what he knew of the good reputation of his wives and added, O Allahs Apostle! Keep you wife, for, by Allah, we know nothing about her but good. `Ali bin Abu Talib said, O Allahs Apostle! Allah has no imposed restrictions on you, and there are many women other than she, yet you may ask the woman-servant who will tell you the truth. On that Allahs Apostle called Buraira and said, O Burair. Did you ever see anything which roused your suspicions about her? Buraira said, No, by Allah Who has sent you with the Truth, I have never seen in her anything faulty except that she is a girl of immature age, who sometimes sleeps and leaves the dough for the goats to eat. On that day Allahs Apostle ascended the pulpit and requested that somebody support him in punishing `Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul. Allahs Apostle said, Who will support me to punish that person (`Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul) who has hurt me by slandering the reputation of my family? By Allah, I know nothing about my family but good, and they have accused a person about whom I know nothing except good, and he never entered my house except in my company. Sa`d bin Mu`adh got up and said, O Allahs Apostle! by Allah, I will relieve you from him. If that man is from the tribe of the Aus, then we will chop his head off, and if he is from our brothers, the Khazraj, then order us, and we will fulfill your order. On that Sa`d bin Ubada, the chief of the Khazraj and before this incident, he had been a pious man, got up, motivated by his zeal for his tribe and said, By Allah, you have told a lie; you cannot kill him, and you will never be able to kill him. On that Usaid bin Al-Hadir got up and said (to Sa`d bin Ubada), By Allah! you are a liar. By Allah, we will kill him; and you are a hypocrite, defending the hypocrites. On this the two tribes of Aus and Khazraj got excited and were about to fight each other, while Allahs Apostle was standing on the pulpit. He got down and quieted them till they became silent and he kept quiet. On that day I kept on weeping so much so that neither did my tears stop, nor could I sleep. In the morning my parents were with me and I had wept for two nights and a day, till I thought my liver would burst from weeping. While they were sitting with me and I was weeping, an Ansari woman asked my permission to enter, and I allowed her to come in. She sat down and started weeping with me. While we were in this state, Allahs Apostle came and sat down and he had never sat with me since the day they forged the accusation. No revelation regarding my case came to him for a month. He recited Tashah-hud (i.e. None has the right to be worshipped but Allah and Muhammad is His Apostle) and then said, O `Aisha! I have been informed such-and-such about you; if you are innocent, then Allah will soon reveal your innocence, and if you have committed a sin, then repent to Allah and ask Him to forgive you, for when a person confesses his sin and asks Allah for forgiveness, Allah accepts his repentance. When Allahs Apostle finished his speech my tears ceased completely and there remained not even a single drop of it. I requested my father to reply to Allahs Apostle on my behalf. My father said, By Allah, I do not know what to say to Allahs Apostle. I said to my mother, Talk to Allahs Apostle on my behalf. She said, By Allah, I do not know what to say to Allahs Apostle. I was a young girl and did not have much knowledge of the Quran. I said. I know, by Allah, that you have listened to what people are saying and that has been planted in your minds and you have taken it as a truth. Now, if I told you that I am innocent and Allah knows that I am innocent, you would not believe me and if I confessed to you falsely that I am guilty, and Allah knows that I am innocent you would believe me. By Allah, I dont compare my situation with you except to the situation of Josephs father (i.e. Jacob) who said, So (for me) patience is most fitting against that which you assert and it is Allah (Alone) whose help can be sought. Then I turned to the other side of my bed hoping that Allah would prove my innocence. By Allah I never thought that Allah would reveal Divine Inspiration in my case, as I considered myself too inferior to be talked of in the Holy Quran. I had hoped that Allahs Apostle might have a dream in which Allah would prove my innocence. By Allah, Allahs Apostle had not got up and nobody had left the house before the Divine Inspiration came to Allahs Apostle. So, there overtook him the same state which used to overtake him, (when he used to have, on being inspired divinely). He was sweating so much so that the drops of the sweat were dropping like pearls though it was a (cold) wintry day. When that state of Allahs Apostle was over, he was smiling and the first word he said, `Aisha! Thank Allah, for Allah has declared your innocence. My mother told me to go to Allahs Apostle . I replied, By Allah I will not go to him and will not thank but Allah. So Allah revealed: \"Verily! They who spread the slander are a gang among you . . .\" (24.11) When Allah gave the declaration of my Innocence, Abu Bakr, who used to provide for Mistah bin Uthatha for he was his relative, said, By Allah, I will never provide Mistah with anything because of what he said about Aisha. But Allah later revealed: -- \"And let not those who are good and wealthy among you swear not to help their kinsmen, those in need and those who left their homes in Allahs Cause. Let them forgive and overlook. Do you not wish that Allah should forgive you? Verily! Allah is Oft-forgiving, Most Merciful.\" (24.22) After that Abu Bakr said, Yes ! By Allah! I like that Allah should forgive me, and resumed helping Mistah whom he used to help before. Allahs Apostle also asked Zainab bint Jahsh (i.e. the Prophets wife about me saying, What do you know and what did you see? She replied, O Allahs Apostle! I refrain to claim hearing or seeing what I have not heard or seen. By Allah, I know nothing except goodness about Aisha.\" Aisha further added \"Zainab was competing with me (in her beauty and the Prophets love), yet Allah protected her (from being malicious), for she had piety.\"<D>Narrated Ibn `Abbas:The first lady to use a girdle was the mother of Ishmael. She used a girdle so that she might hide her tracks from Sarah. Abraham brought her and her son Ishmael while she was suckling him, to a place near the Ka`ba under a tree on the spot of Zamzam, at the highest place in the mosque. During those days there was nobody in Mecca, nor was there any water So he made them sit over there and placed near them a leather bag containing some dates, and a small water-skin containing some water, and set out homeward. Ishmaels mother followed him saying, \"O Abraham! Where are you going, leaving us in this valley where there is no person whose company we may enjoy, nor is there anything (to enjoy)?\" She repeated that to him many times, but he did not look back at her Then she asked him, \"Has Allah ordered you to do so?\" He said, \"Yes.\" She said, \"Then He will not neglect us,\" and returned while Abraham proceeded onwards, and on reaching the Thaniya where they could not see him, he faced the Ka`ba, and raising both hands, invoked Allah saying the following prayers: O our Lord! I have made some of my offspring dwell in a valley without cultivation, by Your Sacred House (Ka`ba at Mecca) in order, O our Lord, that they may offer prayer perfectly. So fill some hearts among men with love towards them, and (O Allah) provide them with fruits, so that they may give thanks. (14.37) Ishmaels mother went on suckling Ishmael and drinking from the water (she had). When the water in the water-skin had all been used up, she became thirsty and her child also became thirsty. She started looking at him (i.e. Ishmael) tossing in agony; She left him, for she could not endure looking at him, and found that the mountain of Safa was the nearest mountain to her on that land. She stood on it and started looking at the valley keenly so that she might see somebody, but she could not see anybody. Then she descended from Safa and when she reached the valley, she tucked up her robe and ran in the valley like a person in distress and trouble, till she crossed the valley and reached the Marwa mountain where she stood and started looking, expecting to see somebody, but she could not see anybody. She repeated that (running between Safa and Marwa) seven times.\" The Prophet said, \"This is the source of the tradition of the walking of people between them (i.e. Safa and Marwa). When she reached the Marwa (for the last time) she heard a voice and she asked herself to be quiet and listened attentively. She heard the voice again and said, O, (whoever you may be)! You have made me hear your voice; have you got something to help me?\" And behold! She saw an angel at the place of Zamzam, digging the earth with his heel (or his wing), till water flowed from that place. She started to make something like a basin around it, using her hand in this way, and started filling her water-skin with water with her hands, and the water was flowing out after she had scooped some of it.\" The Prophet added, \"May Allah bestow Mercy on Ishmaels mother! Had she let the Zamzam (flow without trying to control it) (or had she not scooped from that water) (to fill her water-skin), Zamzam would have been a stream flowing on the surface of the earth.\" The Prophet further added, \"Then she drank (water) and suckled her child. The angel said to her, Dont be afraid of being neglected, for this is the House of Allah which will be built by this boy and his father, and Allah never neglects His people. The House (i.e. Ka`ba) at that time was on a high place resembling a hillock, and when torrents came, they flowed to its right and left. She lived in that way till some people from the tribe of Jurhum or a family from Jurhum passed by her and her child, as they (i.e. the Jurhum people) were coming through the way of Kada. They landed in the lower part of Mecca where they saw a bird that had the habit of flying around water and not leaving it. They said, This bird must be flying around water, though we know that there is no water in this valley. They sent one or two messengers who discovered the source of water, and returned to inform them of the water. So, they all came (towards the water).\" The Prophet added, \"Ishmaels mother was sitting near the water. They asked her, Do you allow us to stay with you?\" She replied, Yes, but you will have no right to possess the water. They agreed to that.\" The Prophet further said, \"Ishmaels mother was pleased with the whole situation as she used to love to enjoy the company of the people. So, they settled there, and later on they sent for their families who came and settled with them so that some families became permanent residents there. The child (i.e. Ishmael) grew up and learnt Arabic from them and (his virtues) caused them to love and admire him as he grew up, and when he reached the age of puberty they made him marry a woman from amongst them. After Ishmaels mother had died, Abraham came after Ishmaels marriage in order to see his family that he had left before, but he did not find Ishmael there. When he asked Ishmaels wife about him, she replied, He has gone in search of our livelihood. Then he asked her about their way of living and their condition, and she replied, We are living in misery; we are living in hardship and destitution, complaining to him. He said, When your husband returns, convey my salutation to him and tell him to change the threshold of the gate (of his house). When Ishmael came, he seemed to have felt something unusual, so he asked his wife, Has anyone visited you? She replied, Yes, an old man of so-and-so description came and asked me about you and I informed him, and he asked about our state of living, and I told him that we were living in a hardship and poverty. On that Ishmael said, Did he advise you anything? She replied, Yes, he told me to convey his salutation to you and to tell you to change the threshold of your gate. Ishmael said, It was my father, and he has ordered me to divorce you. Go back to your family. So, Ishmael divorced her and married another woman from amongst them (i.e. Jurhum). Then Abraham stayed away from them for a period as long as Allah wished and called on them again but did not find Ishmael. So he came to Ishmaels wife and asked her about Ishmael. She said, He has gone in search of our livelihood. Abraham asked her, How are you getting on? asking her about their sustenance and living. She replied, We are prosperous and well-off (i.e. we have everything in abundance). Then she thanked Allah Abraham said, What kind of food do you eat? She said. Meat. He said, What do you drink? She said, Water.\" He said, \"O Allah! Bless their meat and water.\" The Prophet added, \"At that time they did not have grain, and if they had grain, he would have also invoked Allah to bless it.\" The Prophet added, \"If somebody has only these two things as his sustenance, his health and disposition will be badly affected, unless he lives in Mecca.\" The Prophet added,\" Then Abraham said Ishmaels wife, \"When your husband comes, give my regards to him and tell him that he should keep firm the threshold of his gate. When Ishmael came back, he asked his wife, Did anyone call on you? She replied, Yes, a good-looking old man came to me, so she praised him and added. He asked about you, and I informed him, and he asked about our livelihood and I told him that we were in a good condition. Ishmael asked her, Did he give you any piece of advice? She said, Yes, he told me to give his regards to you and ordered that you should keep firm the threshold of your gate. On that Ishmael said, It was my father, and you are the threshold (of the gate). He has ordered me to keep you with me. Then Abraham stayed away from them for a period as long as Allah wished, and called on them afterwards. He saw Ishmael under a tree near Zamzam, sharpening his arrows. When he saw Abraham, he rose up to welcome him (and they greeted each other as a father does with his son or a son does with his father). Abraham said, O Ishmael! Allah has given me an order. Ishmael said, Do what your Lord has ordered you to do. Abraham asked, Will you help me? Ishmael said, I will help you. Abraham said, Allah has ordered me to build a house here, pointing to a hillock higher than the land surrounding it.\" The Prophet added, \"Then they raised the foundations of the House (i.e. the Ka`ba). Ishmael brought the stones and Abraham was building, and when the walls became high, Ishmael brought this stone and put it for Abraham who stood over it and carried on building, while Ishmael was handing him the stones, and both of them were saying, O our Lord! Accept (this service) from us, Verily, You are the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing. The Prophet added, \"Then both of them went on building and going round the Ka`ba saying: O our Lord ! Accept (this service) from us, Verily, You are the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing.\" (2.127)<D>Narrated Aisha:(The wife of the Prophet) Whenever Allahs Apostle intended to go on a journey, he used to draw lots among his wives and would take with him the one on whom the lot had fallen. Once he drew lots when he wanted to carry out a Ghazwa, and the lot came upon me. So I proceeded with Allahs Apostle after Allahs order of veiling (the women) had been revealed and thus I was carried in my howdah (on a camel) and dismounted while still in it. We carried on our journey, and when Allahs Apostle had finished his Ghazwa and returned and we approached Medina, Allahs Apostle ordered to proceed at night. When the army was ordered to resume the homeward journey, I got up and walked on till I left the army (camp) behind. When I had answered the call of nature, I went towards my howdah, but behold ! A necklace of mine made of Jaz Azfar (a kind of black bead) was broken and I looked for it and my search for it detained me. The group of people who used to carry me, came and carried my howdah on to the back of my camel on which I was riding, considering that I was therein. At that time women were light in weight and were not fleshy for they used to eat little (food), so those people did not feel the lightness of the howdah while raising it up, and I was still a young lady. They drove away the camel and proceeded. Then I found my necklace after the army had gone. I came to their camp but found nobody therein so I went to the place where I used to stay, thinking that they would miss me and come back in my search. While I was sitting at my place, I felt sleepy and slept. Safwan bin Al-Muattil As-Sulami Adh- Dhakw-ani was behind the army. He had started in the last part of the night and reached my stationing place in the morning and saw the figure of a sleeping person. He came to me and recognized me on seeing me for he used to see me before veiling. I got up because of his saying: \"Inna Li l-lahi wa inna ilaihi rajiun,\" which he uttered on recognizing me. I covered my face with my garment, and by Allah, he did not say to me a single word except, \"Inna Li l-lahi wa inna ilaihi rajiun,\" till he made his shecamel kneel down whereupon he trod on its forelegs and I mounted it. Then Safwan set out, leading the she-camel that was carrying me, till we met the army while they were resting during the hot midday. Then whoever was meant for destruction, fell in destruction, and the leader of the Ifk (forged statement) was `Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul. After this we arrived at Medina and I became ill for one month while the people were spreading the forged statements of the people of the Ifk, and I was not aware of anything thereof. But what aroused my doubt while I was sick, was that I was no longer receiving from Allahs Apostle the same kindness as I used to receive when I fell sick. Allahs Apostle would enter upon me, say a greeting and add, \"How is that (lady)?\" and then depart. That aroused my suspicion but I was not aware of the propagated evil till I recovered from my ailment. I went out with Um Mistah to answer the call of nature towards Al-Manasi, the place where we used to relieve ourselves, and used not to go out for this purpose except from night to night, and that was before we had lavatories close to our houses. And this habit of ours was similar to the habit of the old Arabs (in the deserts or in the tents) concerning the evacuation of the bowels, for we considered it troublesome and harmful to take lavatories in the houses. So I went out with Um Mistah who was the daughter of Abi Ruhm bin `Abd Manaf, and her mother was daughter of Sakhr bin Amir who was the aunt of Abi Bakr As-Siddiq, and her son was Mistah bin Uthatha. When we had finished our affair, Um Mistah and I came back towards my house. Um Mistah stumbled over her robe whereupon she said, \"Let Mistah be ruined ! \" I said to her, \"What a bad word you have said! Do you abuse a man who has taken part in the Battle of Badr? She said, \"O you there! Didnt you hear what he has said?\" I said, \"And what did he say?\" She then told me the statement of the people of the Ifk (forged statement) which added to my ailment. When I returned home, Allahs Apostle came to me, and after greeting, he said, \"How is that (lady)?\" I said, \"Will you allow me to go to my parents?\" At that time I intended to be sure of the news through them. Allahs Apostle allowed me and I went to my parents and asked my mother, \"O my mother! What are the people talking about?\" My mother said, \"O my daughter! Take it easy, for by Allah, there is no charming lady who is loved by her husband who has other wives as well, but that those wives would find fault with her.\" I said, \"Subhan Allah! Did the people really talk about that?\" That night I kept on weeping the whole night till the morning. My tears never stopped, nor did I sleep, and morning broke while I was still weeping, Allahs Apostle called `Ali bin Abi Talib and Usama bin Zaid when the Divine Inspiration delayed, in order to consult them as to the idea of divorcing his wife. Usama bin Zaid told Allahs Apostle of what he knew about the innocence of his wife and of his affection he kept for her. He said, \"O Allahs Apostle! She is your wife, and we do not know anything about her except good.\" But `Ali bin Abi Talib said, \"O Allahs Apostle! Allah does not impose restrictions on you; and there are plenty of women other than her. If you however, ask (her) slave girl, she will tell you the truth.\" `Aisha added: So Allahs Apostle called for Barira and said, \"O Barira! Did you ever see anything which might have aroused your suspicion? (as regards Aisha). Barira said, \"By Allah Who has sent you with the truth, I have never seen anything regarding Aisha which I would blame her for except that she is a girl of immature age who sometimes sleeps and leaves the dough of her family unprotected so that the domestic goats come and eat it.\" So Allahs Apostle got up (and addressed) the people an asked for somebody who would take revenge on `Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul then. Allahs Apostle, while on the pulpit, said, \"O Muslims! Who will help me against a man who has hurt me by slandering my family? By Allah, I know nothing except good about my family, and people have blamed a man of whom I know nothing except good, and he never used to visit my family except with me,\" Sa`d bin Mu`adh Al-Ansari got up and said, \"O Allahs Apostle! By Allah, I will relieve you from him. If he be from the tribe of (Bani) Al-Aus, then I will chop his head off; and if he be from our brethren, the Khazraj, then you give us your order and we will obey it.\" On that, Sa`d bin Ubada got up, and he was the chief of the Khazraj, and before this incident he had been a pious man but he was incited by his zeal for his tribe. He said to Sa`d (bin Mu`adh), \"By Allah the Eternal, you have told a lie! You shall not kill him and you will never be able to kill him!\" On that, Usaid bin Hudair, the cousin of Sa`d (bin Mu`adh) got up and said to Sa`d bin Ubada, \"You are a liar! By Allah the Eternal, we will surely kill him; and you are a hypocrite defending the hypocrites!\" So the two tribes of Al-Aus and Al-Khazraj got excited till they were on the point of fighting with each other while Allahs Apostle was standing on the pulpit. Allahs Apostle continued quietening them till they became silent whereupon he became silent too. On that day I kept on weeping so much that neither did my tears stop, nor could I sleep. In the morning my parents were with me, and I had wept for two nights and a day without sleeping and with incessant tears till they thought that my liver would burst with weeping. While they were with me and I was weeping, an Ansari woman asked permission to see me. I admitted her and she sat and started weeping with me. While I was in that state, Allahs Apostle came to us, greeted, and sat down,. He had never sat with me since the day what was said, was said. He had stayed a month without receiving any Divine Inspiration concerning my case. Allahs Apostle recited the Tashahhud after he had sat down, and then said, \"Thereafter, O `Aisha! I have been informed such and-such a thing about you; and if you are innocent, Allah will reveal your innocence, and if you have committed a sin, then ask for Allahs forgiveness and repent to Him, for when a slave confesses his sin and then repents to Allah, Allah accepts his repentance.\" When Allahs Apostle had finished his speech, my tears ceased completely so that I no longer felt even a drop thereof. Then I said to my father, \"Reply to Allahs Apostle on my behalf as to what he said.\" He said, \"By Allah, I do not know what to say to Allahs Apostle.\" Then I said to my mother, \"Reply to Allahs Apostle.\" She said, \"I do not know what to say to Allahs Apostle.\" Still a young girl as I was and though I had little knowledge of Quran, I said, \"By Allah, I know that you heard this story (of the Ifk) so much so that it has been planted in your minds and you have believed it. So now, if I tell you that I am innocent, and Allah knows that I am innocent, you will not believe me; and if I confess something, and Allah knows that I am innocent of it, you will believe me. By Allah, I cannot find of you an example except that of Josephs father: \"So (for me) patience is most fitting against that which you assert and it is Allah (Alone) Whose help can be sought. Then I turned away and lay on my bed, and at that time I knew that I was innocent and that Allah would reveal my innocence. But by Allah, I never thought that Allah would sent down about my affair, Divine Inspiration that would be recited (forever), as I considered myself too unworthy to be talked of by Allah with something that was to be recited: but I hoped that Allahs Apostle might have a vision in which Allah would prove my innocence. By Allah, Allahs Apostle had not left his seat and nobody had left the house when the Divine Inspiration came to Allahs Apostle . So there overtook him the same hard condition which used to overtake him (when he was Divinely Inspired) so that the drops of his sweat were running down, like pearls, though it was a (cold) winter day, and that was because of the heaviness of the Statement which was revealed to him. When that state of Allahs Apostle was over, and he was smiling when he was relieved, the first word he said was, \"Aisha, Allah has declared your innocence.\" My mother said to me, \"Get up and go to him.\" I said, \"By Allah, I will not go to him and I will not thank anybody but Allah.\" So Allah revealed: \"Verily! They who spread the Slander are a gang among you. Think it not....\" (24.11-20). When Allah revealed this to confirm my innocence, Abu Bakr As-Siddiq who used to provide for Mistah bin Uthatha because of the latters kinship to him and his poverty, said, \"By Allah, I will never provide for Mistah anything after what he has said about Aisha\". So Allah revealed: (continued...) (continuing... 1): -6.274:... ... \"Let not those among you who are good and are wealthy swear not to give (help) to their kinsmen, those in need, and those who have left their homes for Allahs Cause. Let them Pardon and forgive (i.e. do not punish them). Do you not love that should forgive you? Verily Allah is Oft-forgiving. Most Merciful.\" (24.22) Abu Bakr said, \"Yes, by Allah, I wish that Allah should forgive me.\" So he resumed giving Mistah the aid he used to give him before and said, \"By Allah, I will never withold it from him at all.\" Aisha further said: Allahs Apostle also asked Zainab bint Jahsh about my case. He said, \"O Zainab! What have you seen?\" She replied, \"O Allahs Apostle! I protect my hearing and my sight (by refraining from telling lies). I know nothing but good (about Aisha).\" Of all the wives of Allahs Apostle, it was Zainab who aspired to receive from him the same favor as I used to receive, yet, Allah saved her (from telling lies) because of her piety. But her sister, Hamna, kept on fighting on her behalf so she was destroyed as were those who invented and spread the slander.<D>(And whomsoever it is Allahs will to guide) to His religion, (He expandeth his bosom) His heart (unto the Surrender) unto accepting Islam, (and whomsoever it is His will to send astray) to leave in error and disbelief, (He maketh his bosom) He leaves his heart (close) like the ferrule of a spear (and narrow) in doubt; this could also mean: the light cannot find a way, or a passage to his heart (as if he were engaged insheer ascent) like a person who is told to rise in heaven: the heart of such a person is not guided to Islam.

May Allah make it easy for you and grant you healing from this affliction. It's important to understand that this is a trick of Shaytan to make worship difficult for you, and to make you doubt your acts of worship.\n\nThe fundamental principle in Islamic Law that combats *waswasah* is:\n\n**\"Certainty is not removed by doubt.\" (Al-Yaqeen la Yuzalu bi Ash-Shakk)**\n\nThis means that if you were certain that you performed *wudu* correctly, then any doubt that arises afterward about its validity (e.g., \"did water reach everywhere?\", \"is there a barrier?\") should be ignored. Your *wudu* remains valid based on your initial certainty.\n\nLet's break down how to combat this, specifically for your situation:\n\n### Understanding What Constitutes a Barrier in Wudu\n\nFor something to invalidate *wudu* by preventing water from reaching the skin, it generally needs to be:\n\n1.  **Substantial:** Not just a tiny flake or dry patch that is easily permeated or insignificant.\n2.  **Impenetrable:** A substance that clearly forms a layer preventing water from touching the skin (e.g., thick paint, nail polish, hardened glue, thick oil that repels water).\n3.  **Present and Known:** You would genuinely know it was there and acting as a barrier *before* or *during* your *wudu*, not just imagine it afterward due to doubt.\n\n### Guidelines for Combating Waswasah in Wudu:\n\n**1. The Golden Rule: Ignore ALL Doubts After Wudu**\n\nThis is the most crucial step. Once you have completed your *wudu*, consider it valid. Any feeling, thought, or visual check that makes you doubt its validity must be **immediately dismissed and ignored**.\n\n*   **\"Loose bits on my nose or eye secretions, or bits on my skin, etc.\"**: These are precisely the things you *must* ignore.\n    *   **Loose bits/skin flakes:** These are generally insignificant and do not form an impermeable barrier. Water easily goes around or through them.\n    *   **Eye secretions (khushm, rheum):** Unless they are a large, thick, dried crust that you know for certain would prevent water from reaching your skin, they are to be ignored. Fresh, moist eye secretions do not prevent water from reaching the skin.\n    *   **\"Bits on my skin\":** If you didn't see or feel a significant, water-impermeable barrier *before or during* your wudu, then after wudu, assume it's nothing or insignificant.\n\n**2. Stop Scrutinizing Your Skin**\n\nYou mentioned, \"I don't like looking at my skin after doing wudoo because I always seem to be able to find something that will cause doubts.\" This is exactly what feeds the *waswasah*.\n\n*   **Do NOT inspect your skin after *wudu*.** Do not run your fingers over it looking for dry spots or \"bits.\" Do not go to a mirror to check.\n*   **Trust in your action:** You intended to wash, you poured water, you rubbed. That is sufficient. The Prophet (peace be upon him) and his Companions did not inspect their bodies after *wudu*. This level of scrutiny is not from the Sunnah and is a door opened by Shaytan.\n\n**3. Do Not Repeat Wudu or Parts of Wudu**\n\n*   If you have a doubt about a specific limb (e.g., \"Did I wash my arm properly?\"), **do not re-wash it.**\n*   If you doubt the whole *wudu*, **do not repeat the entire *wudu*.**\n*   Unless you are **100% certain** (not just a strong feeling of doubt, but actual, clear certainty that a reasonable, non-waswasah person would also acknowledge) that you missed a significant part or that there was a clear, large barrier preventing water, your *wudu* is valid.\n\n**4. How to Define \"Certainty\" for a Waswasah Sufferer:**\n\nFor someone with *waswasah*, \"certainty\" often feels like doubt. To distinguish true certainty from *waswasah*:\n\n*   **True Certainty:** This is when you *know* beyond any doubt, without needing to check multiple times, that something was missed or was a barrier. For example, you poured water on your arm but clearly felt and saw a large, dried patch of paint that prevented water from reaching the skin. This kind of certainty is usually rare for someone suffering from *waswasah* about minor details.\n*   **Waswasah-induced Doubt:** This is when you feel an urge to check, or you find something tiny and then exaggerate its significance. If you have to *search* for it, or if a rational person *without* waswasah would say it's insignificant, then it's *waswasah*.\n\n**5. Focus on the Act, Not the Outcome (in terms of perfection)**\n\nWhen doing *wudu*, focus on performing the steps as prescribed. Once you have washed a limb, move on. Do not dwell or repeat. The Prophet (peace be upon him) typically washed each limb once or twice or three times, and that was sufficient. His *wudu* was simple and straightforward.\n\n**6. Seek Refuge in Allah from Shaytan**\n\nWhen these doubts arise, immediately say:\n*   **A'udhu billahi min ash-Shaytanir-rajeem.** (I seek refuge in Allah from the accursed Shaytan.)\n*   And firmly tell yourself: \"This is from Shaytan. My *wudu* is valid.\"\n\n**7. Understand Shaytan's Goal**\n\nShaytan's aim is to make you miserable, make worship feel like a burden, and eventually make you abandon it. By giving in to *waswasah*, you are effectively obeying Shaytan. By ignoring it, you are disobeying him and pleasing Allah.\n\n**8. Islam is a Religion of Ease, Not Hardship**\n\nAllah says in the Quran, \"...and has not laid upon you in religion any hardship.\" (Quran 22:78) And the Prophet (peace be upon him) said, \"Verily, this religion is easy, and no one burdens himself in religion but it will overpower him.\" (Bukhari) Excessive scrutiny and repetition due to *waswasah* are a form of self-imposed hardship that goes against the spirit of Islam.\n\n### Practical Steps to Implement:\n\n1.  **Before Wudu:** Quickly remove any obvious, large, and known barriers (like paint or dough) that you are *certain* would prevent water. Do not go on a \"search mission\" for invisible things.\n2.  **During Wudu:** Wash each limb, making sure water covers it. Do not excessively rub or repeat. Once done with a limb, move on.\n3.  **After Wudu:** **Do not look at your skin, do not feel for dry spots, do not check for \"bits.\"** Just assume your *wudu* is valid. If a doubt enters your mind, immediately dismiss it by saying \"A'udhu billah\" and remind yourself that your *wudu* is fine.\n4.  **Strengthen Your Tawakkul (Reliance on Allah):** Trust that Allah knows your intention and your struggle. He will accept your worship, even if you are not \"perfect\" by your own overly strict standards.\n\nThis will be difficult at first because your mind has been trained by *waswasah*. You will feel extreme anxiety and fear that your prayers might not be valid. However, this is part of the test. You must be firm and consistent in ignoring these whispers. With time and perseverance, In sha Allah, these doubts will lessen and eventually disappear.\n\nMay Allah grant you ease, peace of mind, and protect you from the whispers of Shaytan."}

There is no single universal \"should.\"\n\nHowever, if we look at the historical and philosophical contexts where such a question might arise (often with a prescriptive intent, as suggested by the phrasing), here are some common perspectives that have shaped ideas about women's clothing:\n\n1.  **Modesty:** Many traditional, religious, or conservative viewpoints emphasize that a woman's clothing should be modest. This often means covering the body in a way that does not draw undue attention, avoid revealing shapes or skin, and sometimes includes specific requirements for head coverings or loose-fitting garments. The definition of \"modest\" varies widely across cultures and religions.\n\n2.  **Gender Distinction:** Historically, and in many cultures, clothing has served to clearly differentiate women from men. This means distinct silhouettes, colors, fabrics, and adornments that are clearly identifiable as \"feminine.\"\n\n3.  **Practicality and Role:** The form of clothing might be dictated by a woman's societal role or daily activities. For example, clothing suitable for domestic work, agriculture, or specific ceremonies. This often meant garments that allowed for movement and offered protection.\n\n4.  **Social Status and Hierarchy:** Clothing could also indicate a woman's social standing, wealth, marital status, or age. Certain fabrics, embellishments, or styles were reserved for specific classes or occasions.\n\n5.  **Protection:** Clothing serves the basic function of protecting the body from the elements (cold, heat, sun, wind) and sometimes from injury during work.\n\n**In contemporary, diverse societies, the prevailing view has largely shifted away from external prescriptive \"shoulds\" towards individual agency and diverse considerations:**\n\n*   **Personal Choice and Expression:** Most modern perspectives emphasize that a woman's clothing should be a matter of her personal choice, reflecting her individual style, identity, comfort, and values.\n*   **Comfort and Functionality:** Clothing should be comfortable and appropriate for the activity, environment, and climate (e.g., professional attire for work, athletic wear for exercise, casual wear for leisure).\n*   **Cultural Context:** What is considered appropriate or fashionable varies greatly across different cultures and subcultures.\n*   **Fashion and Trends:** Clothing is also influenced by prevailing fashion trends, which are constantly evolving.\n\nUltimately, while historical and cultural norms have often dictated \"the form\" of women's clothing, in most modern discourse, the \"should\" is determined by the woman herself, based on her comfort, context, personal expression, and the cultural norms she chooses to embrace or challenge."}
{"Question": "Q: Kindly advise us about ihram purdah. We are leaving for umrah in one days time and really in need of naseehat as some people who are studying deen advise that the sin is great if purdah touches the face, so rather not wear.

What is the dum? And can we please be advised regarding purdah in Haram Sharief whilst in ihraam? ? --T--", "Answer": "A woman in Ihraam should cover her face with a cap purda (which is suspended and does not touch the face) so that she is not seen by strange men. It is impermissible for a women in the state of Ihraam to cover her face with a cloth, etc. in such a manner that the cloth touches the face. And Allah Taala ( ) knows best", "Document": "Fatima bint Qais reported that her husband al-Makhzulmi divorced her and refused to pay her maintenance allowance. So she came to Allahs Messenger (may peace he upon him) and informed him, whereupon he said:There is no maintenance allowance for you, and you better go to the house of Ibn Umm Maktum and live with him for he is a blind man and you can put off your clothes in his house (i. e. you shall not face much difficulty in observing purdah there).<D>Narrated Abu Wail:Somebody said to Usama, \"Will you go to so-and-so (i.e. `Uthman) and talk to him (i.e. advise him regarding ruling the country)?\" He said, \"You see that I dont talk to him. Really I talk to (advise) him secretly without opening a gate (of affliction), for neither do I want to be the first to open it (i.e. rebellion), nor will I say to a man who is my ruler that he is the best of all the people after I have heard something from Allah s Apostle .\" They said, What have you heard him saying? He said, \"I have heard him saying, \"A man will be brought on the Day of Resurrection and thrown in the (Hell) Fire, so that his intestines will come out, and he will go around like a donkey goes around a millstone. The people of (Hell) Fire will gather around him and say: O so-and-so! What is wrong with you? Didnt you use to order us to do good deeds and forbid us to do bad deeds? He will reply: Yes, I used to order you to do good deeds, but I did not do them myself, and I used to forbid you to do bad deeds, yet I used to do them myself.\"<D>Ubadah b. Walid b. Samit reported:I and my father set out in search of knowledge to a tribe of the Ansar before their death (i. e. before the Companions of the Holy Prophet left the world) and I was the first to meet Abu Yasar, a Companion of Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) and there was a young man with him who carried the record of letters with him and there was a mantle prepared by the tribe of Maafiri upon him. And his servant too had a Maafiri mantle over him. My father said to him: My uncle, I see the signs of anger or that of agony on your face. He said: Yes, such and such person, the son of so and so, of the tribe of Harami owed me a debt. I went to his family, extended salutations and said: Where is he? They said: He is not here. Then came out to me his son who was at the threshold of his youth. I said to him: Where is your father? He said: No sooner did he hear your sound than he hid himself behind my mothers bedstead. I said to him: Walk out to me, for I know where you are. He came out. I said to him: What prompted you to hide yourself from me? He said: By God, whatever I would say to you would not be a lie. By Allah, I fear that I should tell a lie to you and in case of making promise with you I should break it, as you are the Companion of Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him). The fact is that I was hard up in regard to money. I said: Do you adjure by Allah? He said: I adjure by Allah. I said: Do you adjure by Allah? He said: I adjure by Allah. I said: Do you adjure by Allah? He said: I adjure by Allah. Then he brought his promissory note and he wrote off (the debt) with his hand and said: Make payment when you find yourself solvent enough to pay me back; if you are not, then there is no liability upon you. These two eyes of mine saw, and he (AbuI-Yasar) placed his fingers upon his eyes and these two ears of mine heard and my heart retained, and he pointed towards his heart that Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: He who gives time to one who is financially hard up (in the payment of debt) or writes off his debt, Allah will provide him His shadow. I said to him: My uncle, if you get the cloak of your servant and you give him your two clothes, or take his two clothes of Maafir and give him your cloak, then there would be one dress for you and one for him. He wiped my head and said: O Allah, bless the son of my brother. O, son of my brother, these two very eyes of mine saw and these two ears of mine listened to and this heart of mine retained this, and he pointed towards the heart that Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: Feed them (the servants) and clothe them (the servants) what you wear, and if I give him the goods of the world, it is easy for me than this that he should take my virtues on the Day of Resurrection. We went on till we came to Jabir b. Abdullah in the mosque and he was busy in observing prayer in one cloth which he had joined at its opposite ends. I made my way through the people till I sat between him and the Qibla and I said: May Allah have mercy upon you. Do you observe prayer with one cloth on your body whereas your mantle is lying at your side? He pointed me with his hand towards my breast just like this and he separated his fingers and bent them in the shape of a bow. And (he said): I thought that a fool like you should come to me so that he should see me as I do and he should then also do like it. Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) came to us in this very mosque and he had in his hand the twig of the palm-tree and he saw mucus towards the Qibla of the mosque and he erased it with the help of the twig. He then came to us and said: Who amongst you likes that Allah should turn His face away from him? We were afraid. He then again said: Who amongst you likes that Allah should turn His face away from him? We were afraid. He again said: Who amongst you likes that Allah should turn His face away from him? We said: Allahs Messenger, none of us likes it. And he said: If one amongst you stands for prayer, Allah, the Exalted and Glorious, is before him he should not spit in front of him, or on his right side, but should spit on his left side beneath his left foot and if he is impelled to do so all of a sudden (in spite of himself) he should then spit in his cloth and fold it in some part of it. (and he further said: ) Bring some sweet-smelling thing. A young man who belonged to our tribe stood up, went and brought scent in his palm. Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) took that and applied it to the end of that twig and then touched the place where there had been mucus. Jabir said: This is why you should apply scent to your mosques. It is reported on the same authority: We set out along with Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) on an expedition of Batn Buwat. He (the Holy Prophet) was in search of al-Majdi b. Amr al-Juhani. (We had so meagre equipment) that five. six or seven of us had one camel to ride and so we mounted it turn by turn. Once there wan. the turn of an Ansari to ride upon the camel. He made it kneel down to ride over it (and after having. mounted it), he tried to raise it up but it hesitated. So he said. May there be curse of Allah upon you! Thereupon Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: Who is there to curse his camel? He said: Allahs Messenger, it is I. Thereupon he said: Get down from the camel and let us not have in our company the cursed one. Dont curse your own selves, nor your children. nor your belongings. There is the possibility that your curse may synchronies with the time when Allah is about to confer upon you what you demand and thus your prayer may be readily responded. It is reported on the same authority: We set out on an expedition along with Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) until it was evening, and we had been near a. water reservoir of Arabia. Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: Who would be the person who would go ahead and set right the reservoir and drink water himself and serve us with it? Jabir said: I stood up and said: Allahs Messenger, it is I who am ready to do that. Thereupon Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: Who is the person to accompany Jabir? And then Jabbar b. Sakhr stood up. So we went to that well and poured in that tank a bucket or two of water and plastered it with clay and then began to fill it (with water) until it was filled to the brim. Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) was the first who appeared before us, and he said: Do you (both) permit me to drink water out of it? We said: Yea, Allahs Messenger. He led his camel to drink water and it drank. He then pulled its rein and it stretched its legs and began to urinate. He then took it aside and made it kneel down at another place and then came to the tank and performed ablution. I then got up and performed ablution like the ablution of Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him), and Jabbar b. Sakhr went in order to relieve himself and Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) got up to observe prayer and there was a mantle over me. I tried to invert its ends but it was too short (to cover my body easily). It had its borders. I then inverted it (the mantle) and drew its opposite ends and then tied them at my neck. I then came and stood upon the left side of Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him). He caught hold of me and made me go round behind him, until he made me stand on his right side. Then Jabbar b. Sakhr came. He performed ablution and then came and stood on the left side of Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him). Then Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) caught hold of our hands together, pushed us back and made us stand behind him. Then Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) began to look upon me with darting looks, but I did not perceive that. After that I became aware of it and he pointed with the gesture of his hand that I should wrap my loin-cloth. When Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) had finished the prayer, he said: Jabir! I said: Allahs Messenger, at thy beck and call. He said: When the cloth around you is inadequate, then tie the opposite ends but when it is small, tie it over the lower body. Jabir reported: We set out on an expedition with Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) and the only means of sustenance for every person amongst us was only one date for a day and we used to chew it. And we struck the leaves with the help of our bow and ate them until the sides of our mouths were injured. It so happened one day that a person was overlooked and not given a date. We carried that person and bore witness to the fact that he had not been given that date so he was offered that and he got up and received that. Jabir reported: We set out on an expedition along with Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) until we got down at a spacious valley and Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) went to relieve himself. I followed him with a bucket full of water and Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) looked about and he found no privacy but two trees at the end of the valley and Allahs Messenger (may. peace be upon him) went to one of them and took hold of one of its twigs and said: Be thou under my control by the permission of Allah, and so it came under his control like the camel who has its nosestring in the hand of its rider, and then he came to the second tree and took hold of a twig and said: Be thou under my control with the permission of Allah, and it came under his control, and when he came in the middle of the two trees he joined together the two twigs and said: join with the permission of Allah. Jabir said: I was afraid lest Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) should be aware of my nearness and go still farther. And Muhammad b. Abbad has used the word\" faitabd\" and I began to talk to myself. And as I saw, I suddenly found Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) before me and the two trees were separated and each one of them was standing at its place. I saw Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) standing for a short time, nodding his head towards right and left. Ismail pointed towards the right and left with the help of his head (in order to demonstrate how the Holy Prophet had pointed). Then he (the Holy Prophet) came to me and said: Jabir did you see my place where I was standing? I said: Allahs Messenger, yes. He then said: Then you should go to those two trees and cut a twig from each of them and go to that place with them where I was standing and stand there where I was standing and place a twig on the right and a twig on the left. Jabir said: I set out and took hold of a stone and broke it and sharpened it and then I came to those trees and cut a twig from each one of them. I then came dragging them until I stood at the place where Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) had been standing and placed a twig on the right and a twig on the left. Then I met him and said: Allahs Messenger, I have done that, but (kindly) explain to me the reason for it. Thereupon he said: I passed by two graves the occupants of which had been undergoing torment. I liked to make intercession for them so that the might be relieved of this torment y as long as these twigs remain fresh. Jabir said: We came back to the (camp of the) army and Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: Jabir, call people for per- forming wudu. I cried: Come and perform wudu, come and perform wudu, come and perform wudu. I said: Allahs Messenger, there is not even a drop of water in the army camp, and there. was a person who used to cool the water for Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) in the old water-skin which kept hanging by the twig. He asked me to go to such and such Ansari and ask him to see if there was any water in that skin. I went to him and cast a glance in it but did not find anything but a drop in the mouth of that water-skin and if I were to draw that, the water-skins,. dried part would suck it up. I came to Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) and said: Allahs Messenger, I have not found anything in it but a drop of water in the mouth of the water-skin and now if I were to draw that, it would be absorbed. He said: Go and bring that to me. I brought that to him. He took hold of it -and began to utter something which I could not understand and then pressed it with his hand and gave that to me and said: Jabir, announce for the tub to be brought. So I announced that the tub of the army (be brought). It was brought accordingly and I placed it before him (the Holy Prophet). Thereupon Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) placed his hands in the tub like this: with his fingers stretched out, and then he placed his fingers at the bottom of the tub and said: Jabir, take it (that waters-skin) and pour water over me, by reciting Bismillah, and I poured water and I said: Bismillah, and found water sprouting out between the fingers of Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him). Then that tub gushed forth until it was filled up and the Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: Jabir, make an announcement to the effect: He who needs water should take that. Jabir said: The people came and got water until they were all satiated. I said: Is there anyone left who wants to get it? And Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) then lifted up his hand from that tub and it was still full. Then the people made a complaint to Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) about hunger and he said: May Allah provide you food! We came to the bank of the ocean and the ocean was tossing and it threw out a big animal and we lit fire and cooked it and took it until we had eaten to our hearts content. Jabir said: I and such and such five persons entered Its socket and nobody could see us until we had come out, and we took hold of one of its ribs and twisted it into a sort of arch, then we called the tallest of the persons of the army and the hugest of the camels of the army and it had the big saddle over it, and it could easily pass through it without the rider having need to bend down.<D>(And he who findeth not (the wherewithal)) the means to free a slave, (let him fast for two successive months before they touch one another) before they have sexual intercourse with one another; (and for him who is unable to do so) i.e. to fast because he is weak ((the penance is) the feeding of sixty needy ones) giving each needy person half a measure (half a sa) of wheat or one measure (sa) of barley or dates. (This) which I have explained regarding the expiation of the Zihar, (that ye may put trust in Allah and His messenger) in order that you acknowledge the obligations of Allah and the wont of His Messenger. (Such are the limits (imposed by Allah)) such are the legal rulings and obligations of Allah regarding the Zihar; (and for disbelievers) in the limits imposed by Allah (is a painful doom) whose pain will extend to their hearts. From the beginning of the surah to this point was revealed about Khawlah Bint Thalabah Ibn Malikal-Ansariyyah and her husband Aws Ibn al-Samit, the brother of Ubadah Ibn al-Samit, who was angered by his wife for refusing him to sleep with her and, as a result, made sexual intercourse with her forbidden on him. But he regretted doing so, and Allah revealed how he could expiate the sin he committed. The Prophet (pbuh) told him: You should free a slave. Aws said: I have very little money and it costs a great deal to free a slave. The Prophet (pbuh) said: Then you should fast two successive months. Aws said: I cannot do so! If I do not eat once or twice a day my eyesight becomes dim; and I fear peril if I fast. The Prophet (pbuh) said: Then you should feed 60 needy ones. Aws said: I can not afford it. The Prophet (pbuh) ordered for him a measure of dates and commanded him to give it to the needy. Aws said: I do not know of anyone in Medina who is more in need of it than I. The Prophet (pbuh) told him to eat it and, with the help of another person, the Prophet (pbuh) fed 60 needy people, and this allowed Aws to go back to hiswife whom he had declared unlawful for himself. <D>(And, O my people!

It's commendable that you are seeking clarity on this important matter before your departure.\n\nLet's address your concerns and the varying advice you've received.\n\n**The Core Principle Regarding Women's Face Covering in Ihram:**\n\nThe consensus among the majority of classical scholars across various schools of thought is that a woman in the state of Ihram **must not cover her face with anything that touches it directly**. This ruling is based on authentic Hadith, such as:\n\n*   Umm al-Mu'minin Aisha (RA) narrated that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: **\"A woman in Ihram should not wear a niqab (face veil) or gloves.\"** (Bukhari)\n\nThis Hadith clearly prohibits wearing a niqab that covers and touches the face in the normal manner.\n\n**Addressing the Conflicting Advice:**\n\n1.  **\"Some people who are studying deen advise that the sin is great if purdah touches the face, so rather not wear.\"**\n    *   **Correction:** The prohibition is indeed against the fabric *touching* the face. If it touches, it's a violation of an Ihram prohibition, which incurs a penalty (dum). While \"great sin\" might be strong language, it's certainly a transgression that requires atonement if done intentionally or for a duration. The conclusion \"rather not wear\" *any* face covering is incorrect if a permissible method exists. Islam enjoins modesty.\n\n2.  **\"Another person who frequents Haram Sharief says that ihraam purdah was only introduced recently by the conserved Indian ulama.\"**\n    *   **Correction:** The *concept* of a woman maintaining modesty by covering her face without the fabric touching it is **not new** and has been discussed by scholars throughout Islamic history. Various methods were suggested, such as holding the fabric away from the face, or using a frame. The specific *design* or \"ihram purdah\" contraption that allows the fabric to hang freely *without touching* the face might be a modern innovation in its physical form, but it serves the purpose of fulfilling an ancient Islamic ruling. It's a means to adhere to both the general command of purdah/modesty and the specific Ihram prohibition.\n\n3.  **\"Yet another apaa says that wear a normal purdah and pay dum.\"**\n    *   **Correction:** While paying a dum can atone for a violation, it is **not permissible to intentionally violate a prohibition of Ihram** when an alternative is available. One should always strive to fulfill the commands of Allah (SWT) correctly without incurring penalties. This advice is like saying \"just break your fast and pay kaffarah\" instead of advising one to fast. The purpose of the dum is to rectify an unintentional or unavoidable violation, not to give permission for intentional transgression.\n\n**Your Desire to Wear the Ihram Purdah (Face Covering without Touching):**\n\nThis is the **correct and permissible approach** for women who wish to maintain face modesty during Ihram.\n\n**How to Implement \"Ihram Purdah\" (Face Covering without Touching):**\n\nThe method widely accepted by scholars for a woman to cover her face while in Ihram (if she wishes or feels it necessary for modesty, e.g., in front of non-mahram men) is to use a piece of cloth (like a khimar, chador, or even a modified niqab) that **hangs down in front of her face but does not touch it**.\n\n*   **Common methods:**\n    *   **Using a Cap/Headband:** Some women wear a small cap or stiff headband under their headscarf, and the face-covering part of the garment is attached to this, allowing it to hang freely without touching the face.\n    *   **Using a Stiffened Edge:** The top edge of the face veil might be slightly stiffened (e.g., with a light plastic insert or thick fabric) so it can protrude slightly and prevent the fabric from falling directly onto the face.\n    *   **Holding it with Hands:** While less practical for extended periods, some women might temporarily hold the fabric away from their face when passing men.\n    *   **Loose Fabric:** Ensure the fabric itself is loose enough that it doesn't cling to the face even with slight movement or wind.\n\n**The most crucial point is that the fabric must not touch the skin of the face (forehead, nose, cheeks, chin).**\n\n**What is the Dum (Penalty)?**\n\nA \"Dum\" (more accurately called Fidyah or Kaffarah in this context) is an atonement for violating a prohibition of Ihram.\n\nIf a woman *intentionally* covers her face with something that *touches* it, and she remains in that state for a duration (e.g., a few hours, or the time it takes to pray two rak'ats), she incurs a penalty (dum).\n\nThe Dum for this violation (and many other Ihram prohibitions) offers three options, from which the pilgrim can choose one:\n\n1.  **Sacrifice a sheep or goat:** This must be slaughtered in the Haram limits (Makkah and its surroundings), and the meat distributed to the poor.\n2.  **Feed six poor people:** This involves providing two full meals to each of six needy persons in the Haram area.\n3.  **Fast for three days:** These fasts can be observed anywhere, consecutively or separately.\n\n**Important Note:**\n*   If the covering *accidentally* touches your face, and you immediately remove it, there is generally **no dum** required. The dum becomes due if it touches intentionally, or if it touches unintentionally but you leave it there for a significant period benefiting from the covering.\n*   If you choose to wear the \"ihram purdah\" properly (not touching the face), then **no dum is required**, because you have not violated the prohibition.\n\n**Advice Regarding Purdah in Haram Sharief Whilst in Ihram:**\n\n1.  **Practice Beforehand:** If you are using a new \"ihram purdah\" design, try it on and wear it for a while before you leave for Umrah. Get comfortable with it, ensuring it truly doesn't touch your face.\n2.  **Light, Breathable Fabric:** Choose a lightweight, breathable fabric for your face covering, as the weather in Makkah can be hot.\n3.  **Be Mindful in Crowds:** During Tawaf (circumambulation) and Sa'i (walking between Safa and Marwah), it can get very crowded. Be extra mindful that your purdah does not get pushed against your face by the crowd. If it does, gently adjust it immediately.\n4.  **Temporary Lifting:** If you need to drink water, or feel overwhelmed, and are in an area where non-mahram men are not directly observing you, you can temporarily lift your purdah for a moment.\n5.  **Focus on Your Worship:** While maintaining modesty is important, your primary focus during Umrah should be on your worship, Dhikr, and connecting with Allah (SWT). Do not let anxiety over purdah distract you excessively. Make Dua that Allah makes it easy for you.\n\nMany women successfully perform Umrah and Hajj while maintaining face modesty using the permissible \"non-touching\" method. It is definitely possible and is the correct way to fulfill both the commands of modesty and the rules of Ihram.\n\nMay Allah (SWT) accept your Umrah and shower you with His endless mercy and blessings. Ameen."}

Let's break down the Islamic ruling and practical advice:\n\n**1. Do you need to wash other clothes that have come in contact with it?**\n\nThis depends on whether there was any **wetness** involved during the contact.\n\n*   **If the pigskin jacket or the other clothes were wet (e.g., damp from rain, sweat, or a spill) when they touched:**\n    Yes, if moisture was present and there was direct contact, the impurity (najasa) would transfer to the other clothes. In this case, those clothes would need to be washed.\n*   **If both the pigskin jacket and the other clothes were completely dry when they touched:**\n    According to the majority of Islamic scholars, if both the impure item (the pigskin jacket) and the pure item (your other clothes) are completely dry, the impurity does **not** transfer. Therefore, you would not need to wash your other clothes.\n\n**In summary:** Most often, clothes touching a dry pigskin jacket do not become impure. The concern arises only if there was wet contact.\n\n**2. Can you wash them in a laundry machine?**\n\n**Yes, absolutely.**\n\nA standard laundry machine is perfectly effective for purifying clothes from najasa. Here's why:\n\n*   **Water and Detergent:** The machine uses plenty of water and detergent, which thoroughly cleanses the clothes and removes any impurity.\n*   **Machine Itself:** The washing machine itself gets rinsed out during the wash and rinse cycles. The water that washes the clothes also washes the drum of the machine, leaving it pure for subsequent washes. You do not need to do any special purification for the machine itself after washing clothes that might have had contact with pigskin.\n\n**Practical Advice:**\n\n*   **For peace of mind:** Even if you're not sure if there was wet contact, or just for your own comfort, washing the clothes is always an option.\n*   **The jacket itself:** The pigskin jacket itself remains impure. While some scholars permit wearing dry impure items for general use, it is generally advised to avoid wearing such items during prayer or in places where ritual purity is strictly required. Many Muslims choose to avoid pigskin products altogether due to their inherent impurity.\n*   **Future handling:** If you continue to keep the jacket, try to store it separately from your other clothes, especially those you wear for prayer, to minimize any potential contact or doubts.\n\nSo, unless your clothes were wet and touched a wet part of the pigskin jacket, you likely don't need to wash them. And if you do need to wash them, a normal laundry machine is perfectly fine."}

When he (the Holy Prophet) turned his back, Abu Musa returned to him and said: Allahs Messenger, they (the people of Yemen) have a drink which is (made) from honey and which is prepared by cooking it until it coagulates, and Mizr is prepared from barley, whereupon Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: Every intoxicant that detains you from prayer is forbidden.<D>Narrated `Aisha:Allahs Apostle was fond of honey and sweet edible things and (it was his habit) that after finishing the `Asr prayer he would visit his wives and stay with one of them at that time. Once he went to Hafsa, the daughter of `Umar and stayed with her more than usual. I got jealous and asked the reason for that. I was told that a lady of her folk had given her a skin filled with honey as a present, and that she made a syrup from it and gave it to the Prophet to drink (and that was the reason for the delay).

This shows a commendable commitment to understanding your faith.\n\nLet's break down the different aspects of your question based on Islamic principles:\n\n### 1. Magic Tricks (as Performance/Illusion)\n\nYour local ustaz's advice is generally in line with the mainstream understanding among contemporary Islamic scholars regarding performance magic (illusionism).\n\n**The Key Distinctions:**\n\n*   **Haram Magic (Sihr):** This refers to actual sorcery, which involves seeking assistance from jinn or supernatural entities, claiming knowledge of the unseen (ghayb), or causing harm to others through occult means. This type of magic is unequivocally *haram* (forbidden) in Islam, as it involves shirk (associating partners with Allah) and forbidden acts.\n*   **Permissible Magic (Ilmu Khid'ah/Ilmu Shawbadhah):** This refers to magic tricks that are purely illusions, dexterity, sleight of hand, or scientific principles. It's a form of entertainment, skill, and artistry.\n\n**Conditions for Permissibility:**\n\n1.  **No Claim of Supernatural Power:** You must not claim that you are using jinn, spirits, divine power, or have knowledge of the unseen. It must be clear that it's an illusion, a trick, or a skill.\n2.  **No Deception (leading to shirk/misguidance):** The audience should not be led to believe that you possess actual supernatural abilities, which could lead them to glorify you in a way that approaches shirk or to fear you as having powers beyond human capacity.\n3.  **No Harm:** The trick should not cause physical, psychological, or financial harm to anyone.\n4.  **Not for Gambling (Maisir):** As you rightly pointed out, it should not be used for gambling.\n5.  **No Neglect of Religious Duties:** It should not distract you from your obligatory prayers, family duties, or other religious obligations.\n\nGiven that you state you only do it for fun, do not claim supernatural power, and do not use it for anything haram, your performance of magic tricks (as illusions) would generally fall under the permissible category.\n\n### 2. Cardistry\n\nCardistry is a modern art form focused purely on manipulating playing cards to create visually appealing patterns, flourishes, and movements.\n\n*   **Nature:** It's a skill, a form of dexterity, and an artistic expression.\n*   **Purpose:** It's for aesthetics, demonstration of skill, and personal enjoyment.\n\nThere is nothing inherently problematic with Cardistry from an Islamic perspective. It does not involve gambling, deception (beyond the illusion of a trick, which is understood as part of the art), or supernatural claims. It's essentially a form of artistic expression using an object.\n\n### 3. The Use of Playing Cards (and the \"Tendency\" Argument)\n\nThis is where the website's concern comes in, and it's a valid point of caution, though not necessarily an absolute prohibition on the object itself.\n\n*   **The Concern (Maisir):** The primary reason some Islamic scholars or websites might advise against playing cards is their strong association with *maisir* (gambling), which is strictly forbidden in Islam. Many games played with cards *do* involve gambling, and this is a significant source of evil (addiction, financial ruin, strife).\n*   **The \"Tendency\" Argument:** The idea is that even if *you* don't gamble, using playing cards might lead you (or others around you) down that path, or expose you to environments where gambling takes place, making it harder to avoid. It's a form of \"blocking the means to evil\" (sadd al-dhara'i').\n\n**Your Situation:**\n\nYou explicitly stated:\n*   \"It does not do anything that makes me tend to do anything haraam.\"\n*   \"I also did not like to play poker because its only a game of chance.\"\n*   \"I only do it for fun.\"\n\nThis is crucial. If you genuinely have no inclination towards gambling with cards, and you are using them purely as tools for an art form (cardistry) or for innocent illusions (magic tricks), then the object itself (the playing cards) is not inherently haram. Like a knife can be used for cooking (halal) or for harm (haram), playing cards can be used for gambling (haram) or for skill-based entertainment/art (halal, provided other conditions are met).\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on your description:\n\n*   Your local ustaz's advice is sound: **Magic tricks are permissible** as long as you do not claim supernatural powers, involve shirk, or deceive people into thinking you have divine/demonic assistance. It's about skill and illusion.\n*   **Cardistry is permissible:** It's an art form based on skill and dexterity, with no inherent connection to forbidden activities.\n*   **The use of playing cards for these purposes is permissible for you:** Since you explicitly state you do not use them for gambling (maisir) and have no inclination towards it, and you are using them as tools for a skill/art, the \"tendency towards haram\" argument does not apply to your personal situation in this context.\n\n**Important Reminders:**\n\n*   **Intention (Niyyah):** Your good intention (fun, art, skill) is fundamental.\n*   **Avoid Doubtful Matters (Wara'):** While permissible, if you ever feel that using playing cards *could* lead you or others towards doubt or haram, it's always best to err on the side of caution. However, in your stated case, this doesn't seem to be an issue.\n*   **Priorities:** Ensure your hobbies do not lead to neglecting your religious obligations (like prayer) or other duties in life.\n\nIn summary, continue to enjoy your magic tricks and cardistry as long as you maintain your pure intentions, present them as skill/illusion, and ensure they do not lead you or others to forbidden acts like gambling or shirk. Your current approach seems aligned with Islamic principles."}

While you are not directly placing these ads or profiting from their specific content, by choosing to use a service that *inherently* places such ads on your platform, you are indirectly providing a medium for *haraam* content to be displayed to visitors, including those who come for medical information.\n2.  **Enjoining Good and Forbidding Evil (Amr bil Ma'ruf wa Nahi anil Munkar):** A Muslim should strive to remove evil and promote good to the best of their ability. Allowing *haraam* content on one's platform, even passively, goes against this principle if there are means to prevent it.\n3.  **Purity of One's Platform/Space:** A Muslim's space, especially one dedicated to a beneficial field like medicine, should ideally be free from elements that contradict Islamic teachings. The presence of *haraam* ads can detract from the integrity and trustworthiness of the site from an Islamic perspective.\n4.  **Control and Choice:** Although you have no control over the *specific content* of the ads once they appear, you *do* have control over the *choice of service provider* and whether to use a service that includes such ads or to pay to remove them.\n\n**Application to Your Situation:**\n\nSince you are aware that *haraam* content (like gambling ads or potentially inappropriate images) appears on your website through WordPress's discretion, and you have two viable options to prevent this:\n\n1.  **Paying the fee for the WordPress No-Ads Upgrade.**\n2.  **Changing to another web-host company that does not display such ads.**\n\nGiven these alternatives, continuing to use the free service that displays *haraam* ads, even without your direct intention or profit, can be considered an indirect form of facilitating or providing a platform for forbidden content.\n\n**The Ruling:**\n\nBased on the above, it **is necessary** to take action to remove these ads from your medical website.\n\n*   **Priority:** The easiest and most direct solution is to **pay the fee for the WordPress No-Ads Upgrade**. This allows you to continue using the platform you are familiar with while ensuring the purity of your site.\n*   **Alternative:** If, for some reason, paying the fee is not feasible or desirable, then it becomes necessary to **change to another web-host company** that either offers a free service without ads, or a paid service where you have full control over the ad content (i.e., no third-party ads placed by the host).\n\nMaintaining a website, especially one providing beneficial information like medical advice, should be done in a manner that aligns with Islamic principles.

", "Generated_Answer": "Yes, as a general rule, **Muslims can wear a tie.** There is no Islamic prohibition against wearing a necktie.\n\nLet's break down the points raised:\n\n1.  **Is it Halal?**\n    *   **No Explicit Prohibition:** There is nothing in the Quran or the authentic Sunnah (teachings and practices of Prophet Muhammad PBUH) that prohibits wearing a tie. In Islamic jurisprudence (fiqh), the default state of things not explicitly mentioned is permissibility (al-asl fi al-ashya' al-ibahah).\n    *   **Not a Religious Symbol:** A tie is a piece of secular clothing, an accessory, primarily used for professional or formal attire in many cultures around the world. It does not hold any religious significance, nor is it a symbol of any other religion.\n    *   **Modesty:** Wearing a tie does not inherently violate Islamic principles of modesty in dress for men.\n\n2.  **\"Someone told me one should quit his job if wearing a tie is must on that job!?\"**\n    *   **This is an extreme and unfounded view.** It does not represent mainstream Islamic scholarship.\n    *   **Likely Misconceptions:**\n        *   **Imitation (Tashabbuh bi al-Kuffar):** Some very strict and minority interpretations might mistakenly argue that wearing a tie constitutes \"imitation of the disbelievers\" (tashabbuh bi al-kuffar). However, the principle of *tashabbuh* applies to imitating people in their *distinct religious practices or beliefs*, or actions that identify one with disbelief. Wearing a common, secular, global professional garment like a tie does not fall under this. Many non-Muslims do not wear ties, and many Muslims in various professions do. It's a cultural norm, not a religious one.\n        *   **Symbolism (Misguided):** Very rarely, someone might misguidedly associate the knot of a tie with a cross. This is not the origin or meaning of the tie, and such an association is purely speculative and not based on any Islamic principle.\n    *   **Earning a Halal Livelihood:** Islam encourages Muslims to work and earn a lawful (halal) living. Quitting a job over wearing a tie, when there is no clear Islamic prohibition, would contradict the emphasis on sustaining oneself and one's family through permissible means.\n    *   **Mainstream Opinion:** The vast majority of Islamic scholars and jurists globally consider wearing a tie permissible for Muslim men.\n\n**In summary:**\n\nYou can absolutely wear a tie on a halal job, or any other job where it is required or preferred. The claim that one should quit their job over wearing a tie is based on a misunderstanding and is not a mainstream or valid Islamic ruling. It's important to differentiate between personal preferences or very strict, minority interpretations and the widely accepted rulings based on the Quran and Sunnah."}

So they placed the cooking pots on the fire, but the Prophet ordered the cooking pots to be turned upside down.

", "Generated_Answer": "Based on the consensus of contemporary Islamic scholars, implanting a tooth is generally considered **Halaal (permissible)**.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the reasoning:\n\n1.  **Restoration, Not Alteration:** The primary justification is that dental implants are a form of *restoration* or *replacement* for a missing body part, rather than an unnecessary *alteration* of Allah's creation for cosmetic vanity or deception. When a tooth is lost due to decay, injury, or disease, it affects chewing, speech, and can lead to further dental problems and bone loss. An implant helps restore these vital functions.\n\n2.  **Medical Necessity and Functionality:** Islam allows and encourages seeking medical treatment and restoring health and function. Missing teeth can impact overall health (digestion), speech clarity, and psychological well-being (self-confidence).\n\n3.  **Analogy to Other Prosthetics:** Scholars often draw an analogy between dental implants and other necessary prosthetics, such as artificial limbs, glasses, or hearing aids, which are universally accepted in Islam for their restorative functions.\n\n4.  **Historical Precedent:** There is a well-known narration about a companion, Arfajah ibn As'ad, whose nose was cut off in a battle. The Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) initially allowed him to make a nose of silver, and when it became foul, he permitted him to make one of gold. While there are specific rules about men wearing gold, this incident supports the principle of replacing lost body parts for functional and social well-being.\n\n5.  **Materials:** The materials used in dental implants (primarily titanium and ceramic) are inert, biocompatible, and not derived from any impermissible substances.\n\n**Conditions for Permissibility:**\n\n*   **Intention:** The primary intention should be to restore function, alleviate pain, improve health, or address a significant impact on one's well-being, rather than purely for excessive vanity or to deceive others.\n*   **No Harm:** The procedure should be performed by qualified professionals and not pose undue harm to the individual.\n\nIn summary, dental implants are widely accepted as permissible in Islam because they serve a restorative and functional purpose, addressing a loss or deficiency in the body, rather than being an act of altering creation for prohibited reasons."}

She used a girdle so that she might hide her tracks from Sarah. Abraham brought her and her son Ishmael while she was suckling him, to a place near the Ka`ba under a tree on the spot of Zamzam, at the highest place in the mosque. During those days there was nobody in Mecca, nor was there any water So he made them sit over there and placed near them a leather bag containing some dates, and a small water-skin containing some water, and set out homeward. Ishmaels mother followed him saying, \"O Abraham! Where are you going, leaving us in this valley where there is no person whose company we may enjoy, nor is there anything (to enjoy)?\" She repeated that to him many times, but he did not look back at her Then she asked him, \"Has Allah ordered you to do so?\" He said, \"Yes.\" She said, \"Then He will not neglect us,\" and returned while Abraham proceeded onwards, and on reaching the Thaniya where they could not see him, he faced the Ka`ba, and raising both hands, invoked Allah saying the following prayers: O our Lord! I have made some of my offspring dwell in a valley without cultivation, by Your Sacred House (Ka`ba at Mecca) in order, O our Lord, that they may offer prayer perfectly. So fill some hearts among men with love towards them, and (O Allah) provide them with fruits, so that they may give thanks. (14.37) Ishmaels mother went on suckling Ishmael and drinking from the water (she had). When the water in the water-skin had all been used up, she became thirsty and her child also became thirsty. She started looking at him (i.e. Ishmael) tossing in agony; She left him, for she could not endure looking at him, and found that the mountain of Safa was the nearest mountain to her on that land. She stood on it and started looking at the valley keenly so that she might see somebody, but she could not see anybody. Then she descended from Safa and when she reached the valley, she tucked up her robe and ran in the valley like a person in distress and trouble, till she crossed the valley and reached the Marwa mountain where she stood and started looking, expecting to see somebody, but she could not see anybody. She repeated that (running between Safa and Marwa) seven times.\" The Prophet said, \"This is the source of the tradition of the walking of people between them (i.e. Safa and Marwa). When she reached the Marwa (for the last time) she heard a voice and she asked herself to be quiet and listened attentively. She heard the voice again and said, O, (whoever you may be)! You have made me hear your voice; have you got something to help me?\" And behold! She saw an angel at the place of Zamzam, digging the earth with his heel (or his wing), till water flowed from that place. She started to make something like a basin around it, using her hand in this way, and started filling her water-skin with water with her hands, and the water was flowing out after she had scooped some of it.\" The Prophet added, \"May Allah bestow Mercy on Ishmaels mother! Had she let the Zamzam (flow without trying to control it) (or had she not scooped from that water) (to fill her water-skin), Zamzam would have been a stream flowing on the surface of the earth.\" The Prophet further added, \"Then she drank (water) and suckled her child. The angel said to her, Dont be afraid of being neglected, for this is the House of Allah which will be built by this boy and his father, and Allah never neglects His people. The House (i.e. Ka`ba) at that time was on a high place resembling a hillock, and when torrents came, they flowed to its right and left. She lived in that way till some people from the tribe of Jurhum or a family from Jurhum passed by her and her child, as they (i.e. the Jurhum people) were coming through the way of Kada. They landed in the lower part of Mecca where they saw a bird that had the habit of flying around water and not leaving it. They said, This bird must be flying around water, though we know that there is no water in this valley. They sent one or two messengers who discovered the source of water, and returned to inform them of the water. So, they all came (towards the water).\" The Prophet added, \"Ishmaels mother was sitting near the water. They asked her, Do you allow us to stay with you?\" She replied, Yes, but you will have no right to possess the water. They agreed to that.\" The Prophet further said, \"Ishmaels mother was pleased with the whole situation as she used to love to enjoy the company of the people. So, they settled there, and later on they sent for their families who came and settled with them so that some families became permanent residents there. The child (i.e. Ishmael) grew up and learnt Arabic from them and (his virtues) caused them to love and admire him as he grew up, and when he reached the age of puberty they made him marry a woman from amongst them. After Ishmaels mother had died, Abraham came after Ishmaels marriage in order to see his family that he had left before, but he did not find Ishmael there. When he asked Ishmaels wife about him, she replied, He has gone in search of our livelihood. Then he asked her about their way of living and their condition, and she replied, We are living in misery; we are living in hardship and destitution, complaining to him. He said, When your husband returns, convey my salutation to him and tell him to change the threshold of the gate (of his house). When Ishmael came, he seemed to have felt something unusual, so he asked his wife, Has anyone visited you? She replied, Yes, an old man of so-and-so description came and asked me about you and I informed him, and he asked about our state of living, and I told him that we were living in a hardship and poverty. On that Ishmael said, Did he advise you anything? She replied, Yes, he told me to convey his salutation to you and to tell you to change the threshold of your gate. Ishmael said, It was my father, and he has ordered me to divorce you. Go back to your family. So, Ishmael divorced her and married another woman from amongst them (i.e. Jurhum). Then Abraham stayed away from them for a period as long as Allah wished and called on them again but did not find Ishmael. So he came to Ishmaels wife and asked her about Ishmael. She said, He has gone in search of our livelihood. Abraham asked her, How are you getting on? asking her about their sustenance and living. She replied, We are prosperous and well-off (i.e. we have everything in abundance). Then she thanked Allah Abraham said, What kind of food do you eat? She said. Meat. He said, What do you drink? She said, Water.\" He said, \"O Allah! Bless their meat and water.\" The Prophet added, \"At that time they did not have grain, and if they had grain, he would have also invoked Allah to bless it.\" The Prophet added, \"If somebody has only these two things as his sustenance, his health and disposition will be badly affected, unless he lives in Mecca.\" The Prophet added,\" Then Abraham said Ishmaels wife, \"When your husband comes, give my regards to him and tell him that he should keep firm the threshold of his gate. When Ishmael came back, he asked his wife, Did anyone call on you? She replied, Yes, a good-looking old man came to me, so she praised him and added. He asked about you, and I informed him, and he asked about our livelihood and I told him that we were in a good condition. Ishmael asked her, Did he give you any piece of advice? She said, Yes, he told me to give his regards to you and ordered that you should keep firm the threshold of your gate. On that Ishmael said, It was my father, and you are the threshold (of the gate). He has ordered me to keep you with me. Then Abraham stayed away from them for a period as long as Allah wished, and called on them afterwards. He saw Ishmael under a tree near Zamzam, sharpening his arrows. When he saw Abraham, he rose up to welcome him (and they greeted each other as a father does with his son or a son does with his father). Abraham said, O Ishmael! Allah has given me an order. Ishmael said, Do what your Lord has ordered you to do. Abraham asked, Will you help me? Ishmael said, I will help you. Abraham said, Allah has ordered me to build a house here, pointing to a hillock higher than the land surrounding it.\" The Prophet added, \"Then they raised the foundations of the House (i.e. the Ka`ba). Ishmael brought the stones and Abraham was building, and when the walls became high, Ishmael brought this stone and put it for Abraham who stood over it and carried on building, while Ishmael was handing him the stones, and both of them were saying, O our Lord! Accept (this service) from us, Verily, You are the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing. The Prophet added, \"Then both of them went on building and going round the Ka`ba saying: O our Lord ! Accept (this service) from us, Verily, You are the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing.\" (2.127)<D>Narrated Muharib bin Dithar:Jabir bin `Abdullah said, \"When Allahs Apostle arrived at Medina, he slaughtered a camel or a cow.\" Jabir added, \"The Prophet bought a camel from me for two Uqiyas (of gold) and one or two Dirhams. When he reached Sirar, he ordered that a cow be slaughtered and they ate its meat. When he arrived at Medina, he ordered me to go to the Mosque and offer two rak`at, and weighed (and gave) me the price of the camel.\"<D>Allah then said to him: (Thrust thy hand into the bosom of thy robe) in your armpit, O Moses, (it will come forth white) shining like the rays of the sun (without hurt) without being afflicted with leprosy.

(One of them), the cupbearer, (said: I dreamed that I was pressing wine) pressing grapes to make wine and giving it to the king. This cupbearer saw in a dream that he entered a vineyard and there he saw a pleasant bough with three offshoots and on the offshoots bunches of grapes. He picked the grapes, pressed them and gave it to the King. Joseph said: As for the vineyard, it is the job you had; the bough represents the expertise you have in your job; its pleasantness represents your position and merit in that job. The three offshoots mean that you will be released in three days and shall return to your job. The pressed grapes you gave to the king means that he will give you your job back, honour you and treat you well. (The other) the cook, who prepared the kings bread (said I dreamed that I was carrying upon my head bread whereof the birds wereeating) he saw in his dream that he was coming out of the kings kitchen carrying on his head three basketsof bread when birds came and ate from the bread on the baskets. Joseph said: You have seen an evil thing. As for your going out of the Kings kitchen, this means that you will lose your job; the three basketsmeans that you will stay in prison for three days. The birds eating from the baskets means that the king will get you out of prison in three days to crucify you and the birds will eat of your head. Before Joseph interpreted their dreams for them, the two men said to him: (Announce unto us the interpretation) interpret for us our dreams, (for we see thee of those good) towards the prisoners; it is also said that this means:you are of those who are truthful in their speech. <D>(Then changed We the evil plight for good) We replaced drought and lack of fruit with fertility, abundance and comfort (till they grew affluent and said: Tribulation and distress did touch our fathers) as they have touched us, but they held firm to their religion.

The default position is that life is sacred and must be protected from its earliest stages.\n    *   **Promoting Abortion Medication:** To promote or facilitate access to medication primarily used for abortion (unless it's specifically for the extremely rare, life-saving cases permissible by scholarly consensus) would be considered cooperation in an act generally deemed impermissible in Islam. The Quran states: **\"And cooperate in righteousness and piety, but do not cooperate in sin and aggression. And fear Allah; indeed, Allah is severe in penalty.\" (Quran 5:2)**\n\n2.  **Birth Control Medication:**\n    *   **Islamic Stance on Birth Control:** The permissibility of birth control methods in Islam is a nuanced issue.\n        *   **Permissible uses:** Many scholars agree that temporary birth control for family planning (e.g., spacing children, for the health of the mother, financial stability if genuinely struggling) is permissible, provided it's not done out of fear of poverty (as sustenance comes from Allah) and not as a permanent means to avoid having children entirely.\n        *   **Impermissible uses:** Permanent sterilization without extreme medical necessity is generally discouraged. Also, using birth control to facilitate illicit sexual relations is strictly forbidden, as it aids in sin.\n    *   **Promoting Birth Control Medication:** While birth control itself can be used for permissible purposes, a company selling it cannot control how its products are ultimately used. If the job involves \"promoting products\" which include birth control, and knowing that these products can also be used for impermissible purposes (like facilitating illicit sexual relations or as a means of completely avoiding children without valid reason), it becomes problematic.\n\n3.  **The Combination and \"Other Medicines\":**\n    *   The crucial point here is that the company provides *both* birth control and abortion medication, and your role is to \"promote products like these.\"\n    *   If a significant part of the company's business and your job involves promoting products directly associated with actions forbidden or highly discouraged in Islam (like abortion), then your income derived from this work becomes questionable.\n    *   Even if \"other medicines\" are permissible, the overall nature of the company and your direct involvement in promoting impermissible aspects makes the entire job potentially impermissible. It falls under the principle of not cooperating in sin.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nGiven that your role would be to **promote** products that include those used for abortion (which is generally impermissible) and birth control (which, while having permissible uses, also has highly impermissible uses and is bundled with the abortion medication), it would be **problematic and generally not permissible (haram)** to take this job from an Islamic perspective.\n\nYour income from such a job would be considered doubtful due to your direct involvement in facilitating and promoting something that is, at least in part, connected to sin.\n\nIt is always advised to seek an alternative source of livelihood that is clearly permissible and free from doubt, as Allah promises sustenance to those who fear Him.\n\n**\"And whoever fears Allah – He will make for him a way out And will provide for him from where he does not expect.\" (Quran 65:2-3)**"}

He wrote (in reply) to me that it was necessary in the early days of Islam.

He killed those who fought and imprisoned others. On that very day, he captured Juwairiya bint al-Harith. Nafi said that this tradition was related to him by Abdullah b. Umar who (himself) was among the raiding troops.<D>Narrated Abdullah Ibn Abbas:When the verse: \"O ye who believe! eat not up your property among yourselves in vanities, but let there be amongst you traffic and trade by mutual good will\" was revealed, a man thought it a sin to eat in the house of another man after the revelation of this verse. Then this (injunction) was revealed by the verse in Surat an-Nur: \"No blame on you whether you eat in company or separately.\" When a rich man (after revelation) invited a man from his people to eat food in his house, he would say: I consider it a sin to eat from it, and he said: a poor man is more entitled to it than I. The Arabic word tajannah means sin or fault. It was then declared lawful to eat something on which the name of Allah was mentioned, and it was made lawful to eat the flesh of an animal slaughtered by the people of the Book.<D>(And We verily gave unto Moses the Scripture) i.e. the Torah, (and there was strife thereupon) about the Scripture of Moses: some believed in it while others did not; (and had it not been for a Word that had already gone forth) enjoined (from thy Lord) to delay His chastisement from your nation, (the case would have been judged between them) their destruction would have already happened and chastisement would have seized them, (and Lo! they are in grave doubt) manifest doubt (concerning it).<D>(Make ready for them) for the Banu Qurayzah as well as for others (all thou canst of force) of arms (and of horses tethered) of female tethered horses which are prepared for fighting, (that thereby ye may dismay) that you may strike fear by means of these horses in (the enemy of Allah) with regard to religion (and your enemy) by killing them, (and others beside them) besides the Banu Qurayzah and all the Arabs; it is also said that this is a reference to the disbelievers among the jinn (whom you know not) you do not know their number. (Allah knoweth them) Allah knows their number. (Whatsoever) of wealth (you spend in the way of Allah) in obedience of Allah, whether it is arms or horses (it will be repaid to you in full) its reward will be repaid to you, none of it will be diminished, (and ye will not be wronged) your reward will not be diminished.<D>And on his authority Ibn Abbas said regarding Allahs saying: (O ye who believe!

(Lo! Allah ordaineth that which pleaseth Him) He says: He makes lawful and prohibits what He wills whether you are in a state of ritual consecration or not.", "Generated_Answer": "Understanding the principles of halal meat and the concept of trust in its certification is crucial for Muslims. Let's break it down:\n\n---\n\n### General Principles Related to Halal Meat\n\nHalal (permissible) meat adheres to strict Islamic dietary laws derived from the Quran and the Sunnah (traditions and practices of Prophet Muhammad PBUH). The core principles include:\n\n1.  **Permissible Animal:** The animal itself must be from a species that is permissible to eat.\n    *   **Permitted:** Cattle, sheep, goats, camels, chickens, ducks, turkeys, deer, etc. (herbivores).\n    *   **Forbidden (Haram):** Pigs (swine), carnivores (e.g., lions, tigers, bears), birds of prey (e.g., eagles, falcons), reptiles (e.g., snakes, crocodiles), amphibians (e.g., frogs), insects (except locusts by some scholars), and animals that are considered repulsive (e.g., mice, rats, scorpions).\n\n2.  **Slaughterer:**\n    *   Must be a Muslim, or a Jew or Christian (People of the Book), who slaughters in the name of God.\n    *   Must be sane and mature (or at least discerning, for a child).\n    *   Must intend to slaughter for consumption.\n\n3.  **Invocation of Allah's Name (Tasmiyah/Bismillah):**\n    *   The slaughterer must recite \"Bismillah Allahu Akbar\" (In the Name of Allah, Allah is the Greatest) or simply \"Bismillah\" (In the Name of Allah) immediately before or at the moment of slaughter.\n    *   If done intentionally, omitting the Bismillah makes the meat impermissible. If forgotten unintentionally, it is generally considered permissible by most scholars.\n\n4.  **Method of Slaughter (Dhabiha):**\n    *   **Sharp Knife:** A very sharp knife must be used to ensure a swift, humane, and efficient cut.\n    *   **Throat Cut:** The cut must sever the trachea (windpipe), esophagus (foodpipe), and the two jugular veins and carotid arteries. This ensures rapid bleeding and minimizes suffering.\n    *   **Blood Drainage:** The animal must be allowed to bleed out completely. This is crucial as consuming flowing blood is forbidden in Islam.\n    *   **No Stunning (Controversial):** The animal must be alive and conscious at the time of slaughter. While some contemporary interpretations allow for *reversible* stunning (where the animal is stunned but still alive before the cut, and would recover if not slaughtered), the classical and most stringent view is that no stunning should be used if it causes death or prevents proper blood drainage.\n    *   **Respect for the Animal:** The animal should not see the knife before the slaughter, nor witness the slaughter of other animals. The slaughter must be done humanely, and no undue suffering should be inflicted.\n\n5.  **No Carrion/Dead Animals:** The animal must be slaughtered while it is alive. If an animal dies before slaughter (e.g., by natural causes, disease, or blunt force trauma), its meat is considered carrion and is forbidden.\n\n6.  **No Contamination:** The meat must not be cross-contaminated with any non-halal substances (e.g., pork products, alcohol, or blood from non-halal animals) during processing, storage, or cooking.\n\n---\n\n### Can We Trust Others' Word on Whether the Meat is or Isn't Halal?\n\nThis is a nuanced question, and the level of trust depends heavily on the source, context, and available verification.\n\n**General Principle:**\nMuslims are encouraged to seek what is definitively halal and avoid what is doubtful. The Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) said: \"Leave that which makes you doubt for that which does not make you doubt.\" (Tirmidhi)\n\n**Factors Influencing Trust:**\n\n1.  **Source of the Claim (Who is Saying It?):**\n\n    *   **A Reputable Halal Certification Body:** This is the **highest level of trust**. Reputable halal certification organizations (e.g., HFSAA, HMA, IFANCA, HMC, etc., depending on the region) employ experts who audit the entire supply chain, from slaughterhouse to processor to retailer, to ensure compliance with halal standards. Look for their logo and verify their accreditation.\n    *   **A Known Muslim Butcher/Store Owner (in a Muslim minority country):** Generally, there's a strong presumption of trustworthiness if the butcher is known to be pious and understands the requirements of halal slaughter. They are selling to their own community and often stake their reputation on it. However, it's still permissible to ask about their sourcing and methods for peace of mind.\n    *   **A Muslim Individual (e.g., a friend, family member) offering meat:** If the person is known to be observant, knowledgeable about halal, and personally verifies their meat source, then their word can be trusted. If they are just repeating what they heard without proper verification, then caution is advised.\n    *   **A General Supermarket/Non-Muslim Establishment (claiming \"halal\"):** This is where **caution is paramount**.\n        *   **Without Certification:** A mere \"halal\" label on packaging from a non-Muslim company without a reputable third-party halal certification is often insufficient. Companies might use the term loosely or have a very basic, non-Sharia-compliant understanding of \"halal.\"\n        *   **With Certification:** If a mainstream supermarket product carries a reputable halal certification logo, then it can be trusted as much as any certified product.\n    *   **A Restaurant (especially non-Muslim owned):** Always ask directly about their halal source. Do they have a certification on display? Can they show you the packaging from their meat supplier? Just saying \"yes, it's halal\" without any proof from a non-Muslim-owned restaurant should be approached with skepticism, as they might not understand the full requirements.\n\n2.  **Context and Environment:**\n\n    *   **Muslim-Majority Country/Community:** In a country or area where the majority population is Muslim and Islamic laws are generally observed, there's a higher baseline assumption that meat sold by butchers is halal, unless there's specific information to the contrary.\n    *   **Muslim-Minority Country/Community:** In non-Muslim countries, the default assumption for meat from general sources (non-specialized butchers or supermarkets) is *not* halal unless explicitly proven otherwise (usually through certification). This is because the standard slaughter practices (stunning, mechanical slaughter, omission of Bismillah, consumption of flowing blood, mixing with non-halal products) generally do not meet halal criteria.\n\n**When to Be Skeptical (and thus, trust less):**\n\n*   **Vague or Unsubstantiated Claims:** \"Oh, it's fine, don't worry about it\" without any details.\n*   **Lack of Reputable Certification:** Especially for imported meats or products from general stores in non-Muslim countries.\n*   **Inconsistent Practices:** If a vendor sells both halal and non-halal items without strict segregation, or if their prices for \"halal\" meat are suspiciously low compared to certified options.\n*   **No Transparency:** If the seller cannot or will not tell you their source, slaughter method, or certification body.\n\n**Conclusion on Trust:**\n\nUltimately, as a Muslim, you are responsible for what you consume. While we don't need to be private investigators for every piece of meat, we are encouraged to exercise due diligence.\n\n*   **Prioritize Certified Meat:** When available, meat certified by a reputable halal certification body is the most reliable option outside of slaughtering an animal yourself.\n*   **Trust Known Pious Muslim Butchers:** If you live in an area with established Muslim butchers who are known for their adherence to Islamic principles.\n*   **When in Doubt, Leave It:** If you have strong doubts about the halal status of meat and cannot verify it to your satisfaction, it's safer to avoid it and seek an alternative.\n\nIt's a balance between ease and certainty. In the absence of absolute certainty, one relies on preponderant opinion or strong likelihood (dhanna ghaliba), which is usually established through reliable certification or trusted community knowledge."}

Let's break down the possibilities regarding those \"strange looks.\"\n\nIt's important to understand that facial expressions are incredibly complex and can be influenced by a vast array of factors.\n\nHere's a breakdown addressing your specific points:\n\n1.  **Can it be linked or traced to hypocrisy or insincerity?**\n    *   **Sometimes, indirectly.** When someone is being insincere or hypocritical, their facial expressions *might* appear incongruent with their words or the situation. For example, a forced smile, a flicker of an emotion that quickly disappears, or a general stiffness can sometimes be subtle indicators of discomfort or a hidden feeling. However, this is *not* a universal \"strange look,\" and it's very subjective. Many people can mask their true feelings very well, and others who are perfectly sincere might *still* have \"strange looks\" for other reasons. **You cannot reliably conclude hypocrisy or insincerity based on an odd facial expression alone.**\n\n2.  **Can it be linked or traced to \"mental behavior of the face\"?**\n    *   **Yes, definitely!** This is a very broad category, but it encompasses many common reasons for unusual facial expressions:\n        *   **Neurological Conditions:** Conditions like Tourette's Syndrome (tics), Parkinson's disease (mask-like face, reduced blinking), Bell's Palsy (facial paralysis), or even effects from a stroke can directly impact facial muscle control and expression.\n        *   **Psychological States:**\n            *   **Anxiety/Nervousness:** People might bite their lip, twitch, have restless eyes, or hold tension in their jaw.\n            *   **Concentration/Deep Thought:** When someone is deeply thinking, processing information, or trying to understand something, their face might contort in various ways (furrowed brow, pursed lips, squinting) that aren't meant to convey emotion but reflect cognitive effort.\n            *   **Stress/Fatigue:** Tiredness or chronic stress can make expressions seem strained or vacant.\n            *   **Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD):** Individuals with ASD sometimes have different ways of using facial expressions or eye contact that can be misinterpreted by neurotypical individuals.\n            *   **Unconscious Habits:** Many people have habitual facial tics (like repetitive blinking, raising an eyebrow, nose twitching) that they are completely unaware of and have no emotional or moral significance.\n\n3.  **Can it be linked or traced to effect of sins done with the face or any form of sins?**\n    *   **From a scientific or observable perspective: No.** There is no scientific evidence or observable, universal physical manifestation on a person's face that directly links to \"sins\" in the way you describe. A lie, for instance, might cause a person to feel guilty or anxious, and *those* feelings *might* manifest as subtle expressions of discomfort, but it's the *emotional response* to the action, not the \"sin\" itself, causing the expression.\n    *   **From a spiritual or theological perspective (varies by belief system):** Some spiritual traditions might believe that inner states (including those related to moral actions) can eventually be reflected outwardly, but this is typically understood in a broader, more metaphorical sense (e.g., a \"hardened\" look over time from unkindness, or a \"radiant\" look from inner peace). This is distinct from a specific, immediate \"strange look\" appearing because of a particular sin. It's not a physical punishment or a direct facial \"mark\" of misdeeds.\n\n**Most Common and Innocent Reasons for \"Strange Looks\":**\n\n*   **Unconscious Habits:** As mentioned, many people have facial tics or habits they're unaware of.\n*   **Active Listening/Cognitive Processing:** Their face might contort as they process what you're saying, think of a response, or try to understand.\n*   **Vision Issues:** Squinting due to poor eyesight or bright light.\n*   **Dental/Oral Issues:** Discomfort from braces, dentures, or a toothache.\n*   **Natural Asymmetry/Personal Style:** Some people naturally have more expressive faces, or a resting face that might seem unusual to others.\n*   **Environment:** Lighting conditions, glare, or even the person's comfort level in the environment can affect their expression.\n*   **Your Own Perception:** Sometimes, our own mood or preconceived notions can influence how we interpret others' expressions.\n\n**In conclusion:**\n\nWhile hypocrisy or insincerity *can* sometimes lead to subtle, incongruent expressions, it's rarely the primary cause of a consistently \"strange look.\" The vast majority of \"strange looks\" are due to **unconscious habits, neurological factors, psychological states (like anxiety or deep thought), or simply the natural way a person's face moves and expresses.**\n\nIt's best to approach such observations with curiosity and empathy rather than immediate judgment. Often, the person is completely unaware of their expression and it has no negative intent behind it."}

To be told that women are \"too emotional\" and therefore restricted from participating in a significant community and religious event is indeed insulting and can feel deeply sexist. Islam, in its essence, does not reduce women to their emotions or forbid them from religious participation based on such generalizations.\n\nLet's break down the Islamic understanding regarding women's participation in funerals and burials. This is an area where there is some scholarly difference of opinion, and often, cultural practices or stricter interpretations influence local community norms.\n\n### 1. Attending the Janazah (Funeral) Prayer (Salat al-Janazah)\n\n**Generally Allowed and Encouraged:**\nThere is a widespread consensus among scholars that women **are permitted and even encouraged** to attend the Janazah prayer. This is an act of worship, a prayer for the deceased, and a communal obligation (fard kifayah).\n\n*   **Evidence:** There are reports that women attended the Janazah prayers in the time of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him). For instance, it is known that women prayed the Janazah prayer for the Prophet himself. As long as they observe proper hijab and maintain separation from men (avoiding free mixing), there is no prohibition.\n\n### 2. Accompanying the Funeral Procession and Attending the Burial at the Graveside\n\nThis is where the main difference of opinion lies.\n\n**A. The View of Discouragement (Makruh):**\nMany scholars, particularly from the Hanbali school and some from the Hanafi and Shafi'i schools, consider it **discouraged (makruh)** for women to accompany the funeral procession all the way to the graveyard and to be present at the immediate burial.\n\n*   **Primary Evidence for Discouragement:** The most cited hadith is from Umm Atiyyah (may Allah be pleased with her), who said: \"We were forbidden from accompanying funerals, but it was not strongly emphasized upon us.\" (Narrated by Bukhari and Muslim).\n    *   The phrase \"not strongly emphasized upon us\" is key here. Scholars who hold this view interpret it as a general discouragement rather than an absolute prohibition (haram). If it were strictly forbidden (haram), it would have been emphasized.\n*   **Reasons for Discouragement (Islamic perspective, not simply \"emotional\"):**\n    *   **Avoiding Excessive Wailing/Lamentation (Niyaaha):** Islam strictly prohibits loud wailing, tearing clothes, slapping cheeks, or excessive mourning, as these actions show impatience with Allah's decree and are considered acts of ignorance (Jahiliyyah). It was a concern that women, due to their natural tenderness and deep emotional capacity, might be more prone to such actions at the raw moment of burial.\n    *   **Maintaining Modesty and Preventing Free Mixing:** In the context of a public gathering with heightened emotions, there could be a greater risk of inappropriate mixing between genders or a lapse in maintaining proper Islamic dress and decorum.\n    *   **Protecting Women from Hardship:** The journey to the grave and the scene of burial can be physically and emotionally taxing.\n\n**B. The View of Permissibility (with conditions):**\nOther scholars, including some from the Maliki school and others who interpret the above hadith differently, argue that it **is permissible** for women to accompany the funeral to the graveside and be present at the burial, provided they:\n\n*   **Maintain Composure:** Do not engage in wailing, lamentation, or any prohibited acts of mourning.\n*   **Observe Hijab:** Are dressed modestly and according to Islamic guidelines.\n*   **Avoid Free Mixing:** Maintain appropriate distance and separation from men.\n*   **Intention:** Their presence is for remembrance, prayer for the deceased, and seeking lessons from death, not for show or prohibited behaviors.\n\n*   **Evidence for Permissibility (or interpretation):**\n    *   The very wording of Umm Atiyyah's hadith (\"not strongly emphasized\") suggests it's not a complete prohibition.\n    *   There are reports of women visiting graves (e.g., Aisha visiting her brother's grave), which implies their presence in graveyards is not inherently forbidden. While this isn't the same as attending the immediate burial, it counters the idea of graveyards being off-limits.\n    *   Some scholars argue that if the reasons for discouragement (wailing, mixing) are absent, then the discouragement itself is lifted.\n\n### 3. Visiting Graves Later\n\n**Generally Allowed and Encouraged:**\nIt is **permissible and encouraged** for both men and women to visit graves later, with the intention of remembering death, praying for the deceased, and reflecting on the afterlife.\n\n*   **Conditions:** The same conditions apply: avoid wailing, maintain modesty, and ensure the visit is for a permissible purpose (not for seeking blessings from graves in a way that leads to shirk, or for excessive beautification).\n\n### Addressing Your Community's Statement (\"more emotional than men\")\n\nWhile the *reasoning* they provided is indeed simplistic, generalizes and can feel sexist, the *outcome* (discouraging women from attending the burial) often stems from the interpretation of the Hadith of Umm Atiyyah and the concerns about preserving Islamic decorum at a highly emotional event.\n\nIt's important to differentiate between:\n\n1.  **A valid Islamic concern:** Preventing actions like excessive wailing (niyaaha) which are strictly forbidden for *everyone*.\n2.  **A cultural or simplified explanation:** Attributing this concern solely to women's \"emotions\" rather than the broader Islamic principle of maintaining composure and avoiding forbidden acts of mourning for all individuals, regardless of gender. Men can also lose composure.\n\n### Conclusion and Practical Advice\n\n*   **Salat al-Janazah (Funeral Prayer):** Women are generally **allowed and encouraged** to attend, observing hijab and avoiding mixing.\n*   **Accompanying to the Grave and Burial:** This is where the difference of opinion and local practice comes in. The most common understanding in many communities is that it's **discouraged (makruh)**, not strictly forbidden. This discouragement is rooted in the aim of preventing prohibited acts like wailing and maintaining overall Islamic decorum.\n*   **Visiting Graves Later:** Women are **allowed** to visit graves later for remembrance and prayer.\n\nIt's understandable to feel upset by the reasoning provided. You can gently explain that while the concern about maintaining Islamic decorum is valid (e.g., no wailing), attributing it solely to women's \"emotions\" is not an accurate or complete Islamic explanation. The wisdom behind the discouragement is often multi-faceted, focusing on preventing specific forbidden actions rather than generalizing about a gender's emotional capacity.\n\nIn situations like this, it's often best to respect the general practice of your local community while understanding the broader Islamic views. The most important thing is to make dua (supplication) for the deceased sister and her child. May Allah grant them Jannat al-Firdaus and give patience to their family."}
{"Question": "I have a question regarding the legality of hanging African style masks on the wall as decoration. Is it permissible? Does it matter on how much detail the mask face has? These masks are usually a stylized face mask. Sometimes the facial features are generalized and other times they are quite detailed. ? --T--", "Answer": "Assalamu alaikum,It would be disliked (makruh) to hang such masks, for two reasons:a) they are close representations of the face (even if only in a stylized manner). Representing the face itself is not permitted. That which is similar to the impermissible is at least disliked;b) masks very often have religious significance, particularly in African cultures, as the article below from the Encyclopdia Britannica shows. We have been commanded to avoid the religious symbols and imagery of other religions., and He alone gives success.Wassalam,Faraz Rabbani It is mentioned in the Encyclopdia Britannicathat:The functions and forms of masksMasks are as extraordinarily varied in appearance as they are in function or fundamental meaning. Many masks are primarily associated with ceremonies that have religious and social significance or are concerned with funerary customs, fertility rites, or curing sickness. Other masks are used on festive occasions or to portray characters in a dramatic performance and in re-enactments of mythological events. Masks are also used for warfare and as protective devices in certain sports, as well as frequently being employed as architectural ornament.Social and religious usesMasks representing potentially harmful spirits were often used to keep a required balance of power or a traditional relationship of inherited positions within a culture. The forms of these masks invariably were prescribed by tradition, as were their uses. This type of mask was often associated with secret societies, especially in Africa, where the greatest range of types and functions can be found. They were also widely used among Oceanic peoples of the South Pacific and the American Indians and are even used in some of the folk rites still performed in Europe.Masks have served an important role as a means of discipline and have been used to admonish women, children, and criminals. Common in China, Africa, Oceania, and North America, admonitory masks usually completely cover the features of the wearer. It is believed among some of the African Negro tribes that the first mask was an admonitory one. A child, repeatedly told not to, persisted in following its mother to fetch water. To frighten and discipline the child, the mother painted a hideous face on the bottom of her water gourd. Others say the mask was invented by a secret African society to escape recognition while punishing marauders. In New Britain, members of a secret terroristic society called the Dukduk appear in monstrous five-foot masks to police, to judge, and to execute offenders. Aggressive supernatural spirits of an almost demonic nature are represented by these masks, which are constructed from a variety of materials, usually including tapa, or bark cloth, and the pith of certain reeds. These materials are painted in brilliant colours, with brick red and acid green predominating.In many cultures throughout the world, a judge wears a mask to protect him from future recriminations. In this instance, the mask represents a traditionally sanctioned spirit from the past who assumes responsibility for the decision levied on the culprit.Rituals, often nocturnal, by members of secret societies wearing ancestor masks are reminders of the ancient sanction of their conduct. In many cultures, these masked ceremonials are intended to prevent miscreant acts and to maintain the circumscribed activities of the tribe. Along the Guinea coast of West Africa, for instance, many highly realistic masks represent ancestors who enjoyed specific cultural roles; the masks symbolize sanction and control when donned by the wearer. Among some of the Dan and Ngere tribes of Liberia and Ivory Coast, ancestor masks with generic features act as intermediaries for the transmission of petitions or offerings of respect to the gods. These traditional ancestral emissaries exert by their spirit power a social control for the community.Particularly among Oceanic peoples, American Indians, and Negro tribes of Africa, certain times of the year are set aside to honour spirits or ancestors. Among non literate peoples who cannot record their own histories, masked rituals act as an important link between past and present, giving a sense of historic continuity that strengthens their social bond. On these occasions, masks usually recognizable as dead chieftains, relatives, friends, or even foes are worn or exhibited. Gifts are made to the spirits incarnated in the masks, while in other instances dancers wearing stylized mourning masks perform the prescribed ceremony.In western Melanesia, the ancestral ceremonial mask occurs in a great variety of forms and materials. The Sepik River area in north central New Guinea is the source of an extremely rich array of these mask forms mostly carved in wood, ranging from small faces to large fantastic forms with a variety of appendages affixed to the wood, including shell, fibre, animal skins, seed, flowers, and feathers. These masks are highly polychromed with earth colours of red and yellow, lime white, and charcoal black. They often represent supernatural spirits as well as ancestors and therefore have both a religious and a social significance.Members of secret societies usually conduct the rituals of initiation, when a young man is instructed in his future role as an adult and is acquainted with the rules controlling the social stability of the tribe. Totem and spiritualistic masks are donned by the elders at these ceremonies. Sometimes the masks used are reserved only for initiations. Among the most impressive of the initiation masks are the exquisitely carved human faces of west coast African Negro tribes. In western and central Congo (Kinshasa), in Africa, large, colourful helmet like masks are used as a masquerading device when the youth emerges from the initiation area and is introduced to the villagers as an adult of the tribe. After a lengthy ordeal of teaching and initiation rites, for instance, a youth of the Pende tribe appears in a distinctive colourful mask indicative of his new role as an adult. The mask is later cast aside and replaced by a small ivory duplicate, worn as a charm against misfortune and as a symbol of his manhood.Believing everything in nature to possess a spirit, man found authority for himself and his family by identifying with a specific nonhuman spirit. He adopted an object of nature; then he mythologically traced his ancestry back to the chosen object; he preempted the animal as the emblem of himself and his clan. This is the practice of totem, which consolidates family pride and distinguishes social lines. Masks are made to house the totem spirit. The totem ancestor is believed actually to materialize in its mask; thus masks are of the utmost importance in securing protection and bringing comfort to the totem clan.The Papuans of New Guinea build mammoth masks called hevehe,attaining 20 feet in height. They are constructed of a palm wood armature covered in bark cloth; geometric designs are stitched on with painted cane strips. These fantastic mananimal masks are given a frightening aspect. When they emerge from the mens secret clubhouse, they serve to protect the members of the clan. The so-called totem pole of the Alaskan and British Columbian Indian fulfills the same function. The African totem mask is often carved from ebony or other hard woods, designed with graceful lines and showing a highly polished surface. Animal masks, their features elongated and beautifully formalized, are common in western Africa. Dried grass, woven palm fibres, coconuts, and shells, as well as wood are employed in the masks of New Guinea, New Ireland, and New Caledonia. Represented are fanciful birds, fishes, and animals with distorted or exaggerated features.The high priest and medicine man, or the shaman, frequently had his own very powerful totem, in whose mask he could exorcise evil spirits, punish enemies, locate game or fish, predict the weather, and, most importantly, cure disease.The Northwest Coast Indians of North America in particular devised mechanical masks with movable parts to reveal a second facegenerally a human image. Believing that the human spirit could take animal form and vice versa, the makers of these masks fused man and bird or man and animal into one mask. Some of these articulating masks acted out entire legends as their parts moved.[Copyright1994-2002 Encyclopdia Britannica, Inc", "Document": "Zaid bin Khalid al-Juhani said :A man asked the Messenger of Allah (SWAS) about a find.

He asked : Messenger of Allah, what about a stray sheep? He replied: Take it; that is for you, or for your brother, or for the wolf. He again asked: Messenger of Allah, What about stray camels? The Messenger of Allah (SWAS) became angry so much so that his cheeks became red or ( the narrator is doubtful) his face became red. He replied: What have you to do with them?

", "Generated_Answer": "Let's break down the question of hanging African-style masks as decoration from both a legal and a cultural/ethical perspective.\n\n**1. Legality: Is it Permissible by Law?**\n\n**Yes, legally, it is absolutely permissible.** There are no laws in the United States (or generally in Western countries) that prohibit individuals from purchasing, owning, or displaying decorative items, including masks of any cultural origin, in their private homes. You will not face legal repercussions for hanging an African-style mask on your wall.\n\nThe \"legality\" aspect is quite straightforward: if you purchased the mask legally, you can display it.\n\n**2. Permissibility: Cultural and Ethical Considerations**\n\nThis is where the nuance comes in. While not illegal, displaying cultural artifacts can raise questions about **cultural appropriation** and **respectful engagement**.\n\n*   **What is Cultural Appropriation?**\n    Cultural appropriation is generally understood as the adoption or use of elements of a minority culture by members of the dominant culture, often without understanding or respecting the original culture, meaning, or context. It can be problematic when it leads to:\n    *   **Trivialization:** Reducing a sacred or meaningful item to a mere trend or \"exotic\" decoration.\n    *   **Commodification:** Profiting from cultural elements without benefiting the original creators or community.\n    *   **Misrepresentation:** Perpetuating stereotypes or a superficial understanding of a culture.\n    *   **Loss of Context:** Stripping an item of its deep cultural, spiritual, or historical significance.\n\n*   **Does Hanging an African Mask Always Constitute Problematic Appropriation?**\n    Not necessarily. It largely depends on:\n\n    *   **Your Intent:** Are you displaying it out of genuine appreciation for the artistry, history, and culture it represents? Or is it simply a generic \"exotic\" piece to fill a wall without any thought for its origin?\n    *   **Your Knowledge/Understanding:** Have you taken any time to learn about the culture, people, or specific traditions from which the mask originates? Do you know its intended purpose (e.g., ritual, ceremony, performance, status symbol)? Understanding adds a layer of respect.\n    *   **How You Acquired It:** Was it purchased ethically, perhaps directly from artisans or through fair-trade channels that benefit the originating communities? Or is it a mass-produced item that exploits cultural designs for profit without giving back?\n    *   **The Specific Mask's Nature:** Some masks are purely decorative or tourist items designed for sale. Others are deeply sacred, ceremonial, or historically significant objects that were never intended for casual display. Knowing the difference can be important.\n\n**3. Does Detail Matter?**\n\nFrom a **legal standpoint**, no, the level of detail on the mask face does not affect its legality.\n\nFrom a **cultural sensitivity standpoint**, it *can* matter:\n\n*   **Generalized/Stylized Masks:** These might be less likely to be directly associated with a specific, highly sacred ritual or specific community's secret practices. However, they still draw upon a rich artistic tradition and should be treated with general respect for their origins.\n*   **Highly Detailed Masks:** These are more likely to represent a very specific culture, spiritual entity, or ritualistic purpose. If a mask is clearly identifiable as a significant artifact from a particular group, displaying it without understanding its meaning or, worse, in a disrespectful way (e.g., mixing it with other unrelated \"exotic\" items without context) could be seen as more problematic by members of that culture.\n\n**In Summary and Recommendation:**\n\n1.  **Legally, you are absolutely free to hang African-style masks.**\n2.  **Ethically, consider your approach:**\n    *   **Educate Yourself:** Learn about the culture, meaning, and significance of the mask (or the style it represents). This transforms it from just a decoration into a piece of art with a story.\n    *   **Source Ethically:** If purchasing new, try to buy from reputable sources that genuinely support African artisans and communities (e.g., fair trade organizations, galleries specializing in authentic African art).\n    *   **Display with Respect:** Treat the mask as an artistic and cultural object, not merely a trendy item.\n    *   **Your Intent Matters Most:** If your intent is genuine appreciation and respect, and you've made an effort to understand what you're displaying, it's generally viewed much more favorably than simply using it as a \"cool\" prop without any thought.\n\nUltimately, the act of decorating with a mask itself isn't inherently right or wrong, but the *mindset* and *actions* around that display (knowledge, sourcing, intent) determine its ethical permissibility."}
{"Question": "Q: My question is that I am suffering from inferiority complex. I mean despite having friends, good family, beauty, money and all these, my heart is not satisfied. I only think with myself that I dont have any friend, I get serious on small jokes of my friends, I get too much tension from small things. I think that the people are ignoring me, if two of my friends are going closer and I am a little on distance with them I feel that they dont care of me, whenever I look to the handwriting of my friend my heart says that there writing is better than mine. Simply I would like to say that I have no peace of heart and mind and I always consider myself smaller than others. Please tell me the reason and treatment. ? --T--", "Answer": "Do not pay attention to all these negative feelings. Instead be normal when you conduct with people. Be punctual on your salaah and ensure that you observe purdah from all na mahrams. Commence taleem of fazaail aamaal and fazaail sadaqaat daily. And Allah Taala ( ) knows best", "Document": "Narrated Aisha:(The wife of the Prophet) Whenever Allahs Apostle intended to go on a journey, he used to draw lots among his wives and would take with him the one on whom the lot had fallen. Once he drew lots when he wanted to carry out a Ghazwa, and the lot came upon me. So I proceeded with Allahs Apostle after Allahs order of veiling (the women) had been revealed and thus I was carried in my howdah (on a camel) and dismounted while still in it. We carried on our journey, and when Allahs Apostle had finished his Ghazwa and returned and we approached Medina, Allahs Apostle ordered to proceed at night. When the army was ordered to resume the homeward journey, I got up and walked on till I left the army (camp) behind. When I had answered the call of nature, I went towards my howdah, but behold ! A necklace of mine made of Jaz Azfar (a kind of black bead) was broken and I looked for it and my search for it detained me. The group of people who used to carry me, came and carried my howdah on to the back of my camel on which I was riding, considering that I was therein. At that time women were light in weight and were not fleshy for they used to eat little (food), so those people did not feel the lightness of the howdah while raising it up, and I was still a young lady. They drove away the camel and proceeded. Then I found my necklace after the army had gone. I came to their camp but found nobody therein so I went to the place where I used to stay, thinking that they would miss me and come back in my search. While I was sitting at my place, I felt sleepy and slept. Safwan bin Al-Muattil As-Sulami Adh- Dhakw-ani was behind the army. He had started in the last part of the night and reached my stationing place in the morning and saw the figure of a sleeping person. He came to me and recognized me on seeing me for he used to see me before veiling. I got up because of his saying: \"Inna Li l-lahi wa inna ilaihi rajiun,\" which he uttered on recognizing me. I covered my face with my garment, and by Allah, he did not say to me a single word except, \"Inna Li l-lahi wa inna ilaihi rajiun,\" till he made his shecamel kneel down whereupon he trod on its forelegs and I mounted it. Then Safwan set out, leading the she-camel that was carrying me, till we met the army while they were resting during the hot midday. Then whoever was meant for destruction, fell in destruction, and the leader of the Ifk (forged statement) was `Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul. After this we arrived at Medina and I became ill for one month while the people were spreading the forged statements of the people of the Ifk, and I was not aware of anything thereof. But what aroused my doubt while I was sick, was that I was no longer receiving from Allahs Apostle the same kindness as I used to receive when I fell sick. Allahs Apostle would enter upon me, say a greeting and add, \"How is that (lady)?\" and then depart. That aroused my suspicion but I was not aware of the propagated evil till I recovered from my ailment. I went out with Um Mistah to answer the call of nature towards Al-Manasi, the place where we used to relieve ourselves, and used not to go out for this purpose except from night to night, and that was before we had lavatories close to our houses. And this habit of ours was similar to the habit of the old Arabs (in the deserts or in the tents) concerning the evacuation of the bowels, for we considered it troublesome and harmful to take lavatories in the houses. So I went out with Um Mistah who was the daughter of Abi Ruhm bin `Abd Manaf, and her mother was daughter of Sakhr bin Amir who was the aunt of Abi Bakr As-Siddiq, and her son was Mistah bin Uthatha. When we had finished our affair, Um Mistah and I came back towards my house. Um Mistah stumbled over her robe whereupon she said, \"Let Mistah be ruined ! \" I said to her, \"What a bad word you have said! Do you abuse a man who has taken part in the Battle of Badr? She said, \"O you there! Didnt you hear what he has said?\" I said, \"And what did he say?\" She then told me the statement of the people of the Ifk (forged statement) which added to my ailment. When I returned home, Allahs Apostle came to me, and after greeting, he said, \"How is that (lady)?\" I said, \"Will you allow me to go to my parents?\" At that time I intended to be sure of the news through them. Allahs Apostle allowed me and I went to my parents and asked my mother, \"O my mother! What are the people talking about?\" My mother said, \"O my daughter! Take it easy, for by Allah, there is no charming lady who is loved by her husband who has other wives as well, but that those wives would find fault with her.\" I said, \"Subhan Allah! Did the people really talk about that?\" That night I kept on weeping the whole night till the morning. My tears never stopped, nor did I sleep, and morning broke while I was still weeping, Allahs Apostle called `Ali bin Abi Talib and Usama bin Zaid when the Divine Inspiration delayed, in order to consult them as to the idea of divorcing his wife. Usama bin Zaid told Allahs Apostle of what he knew about the innocence of his wife and of his affection he kept for her. He said, \"O Allahs Apostle! She is your wife, and we do not know anything about her except good.\" But `Ali bin Abi Talib said, \"O Allahs Apostle! Allah does not impose restrictions on you; and there are plenty of women other than her. If you however, ask (her) slave girl, she will tell you the truth.\" `Aisha added: So Allahs Apostle called for Barira and said, \"O Barira! Did you ever see anything which might have aroused your suspicion? (as regards Aisha). Barira said, \"By Allah Who has sent you with the truth, I have never seen anything regarding Aisha which I would blame her for except that she is a girl of immature age who sometimes sleeps and leaves the dough of her family unprotected so that the domestic goats come and eat it.\" So Allahs Apostle got up (and addressed) the people an asked for somebody who would take revenge on `Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul then. Allahs Apostle, while on the pulpit, said, \"O Muslims! Who will help me against a man who has hurt me by slandering my family? By Allah, I know nothing except good about my family, and people have blamed a man of whom I know nothing except good, and he never used to visit my family except with me,\" Sa`d bin Mu`adh Al-Ansari got up and said, \"O Allahs Apostle! By Allah, I will relieve you from him. If he be from the tribe of (Bani) Al-Aus, then I will chop his head off; and if he be from our brethren, the Khazraj, then you give us your order and we will obey it.\" On that, Sa`d bin Ubada got up, and he was the chief of the Khazraj, and before this incident he had been a pious man but he was incited by his zeal for his tribe. He said to Sa`d (bin Mu`adh), \"By Allah the Eternal, you have told a lie! You shall not kill him and you will never be able to kill him!\" On that, Usaid bin Hudair, the cousin of Sa`d (bin Mu`adh) got up and said to Sa`d bin Ubada, \"You are a liar! By Allah the Eternal, we will surely kill him; and you are a hypocrite defending the hypocrites!\" So the two tribes of Al-Aus and Al-Khazraj got excited till they were on the point of fighting with each other while Allahs Apostle was standing on the pulpit. Allahs Apostle continued quietening them till they became silent whereupon he became silent too. On that day I kept on weeping so much that neither did my tears stop, nor could I sleep. In the morning my parents were with me, and I had wept for two nights and a day without sleeping and with incessant tears till they thought that my liver would burst with weeping. While they were with me and I was weeping, an Ansari woman asked permission to see me. I admitted her and she sat and started weeping with me. While I was in that state, Allahs Apostle came to us, greeted, and sat down,. He had never sat with me since the day what was said, was said. He had stayed a month without receiving any Divine Inspiration concerning my case. Allahs Apostle recited the Tashahhud after he had sat down, and then said, \"Thereafter, O `Aisha! I have been informed such and-such a thing about you; and if you are innocent, Allah will reveal your innocence, and if you have committed a sin, then ask for Allahs forgiveness and repent to Him, for when a slave confesses his sin and then repents to Allah, Allah accepts his repentance.\" When Allahs Apostle had finished his speech, my tears ceased completely so that I no longer felt even a drop thereof. Then I said to my father, \"Reply to Allahs Apostle on my behalf as to what he said.\" He said, \"By Allah, I do not know what to say to Allahs Apostle.\" Then I said to my mother, \"Reply to Allahs Apostle.\" She said, \"I do not know what to say to Allahs Apostle.\" Still a young girl as I was and though I had little knowledge of Quran, I said, \"By Allah, I know that you heard this story (of the Ifk) so much so that it has been planted in your minds and you have believed it. So now, if I tell you that I am innocent, and Allah knows that I am innocent, you will not believe me; and if I confess something, and Allah knows that I am innocent of it, you will believe me. By Allah, I cannot find of you an example except that of Josephs father: \"So (for me) patience is most fitting against that which you assert and it is Allah (Alone) Whose help can be sought. Then I turned away and lay on my bed, and at that time I knew that I was innocent and that Allah would reveal my innocence. But by Allah, I never thought that Allah would sent down about my affair, Divine Inspiration that would be recited (forever), as I considered myself too unworthy to be talked of by Allah with something that was to be recited: but I hoped that Allahs Apostle might have a vision in which Allah would prove my innocence. By Allah, Allahs Apostle had not left his seat and nobody had left the house when the Divine Inspiration came to Allahs Apostle . So there overtook him the same hard condition which used to overtake him (when he was Divinely Inspired) so that the drops of his sweat were running down, like pearls, though it was a (cold) winter day, and that was because of the heaviness of the Statement which was revealed to him. When that state of Allahs Apostle was over, and he was smiling when he was relieved, the first word he said was, \"Aisha, Allah has declared your innocence.\" My mother said to me, \"Get up and go to him.\" I said, \"By Allah, I will not go to him and I will not thank anybody but Allah.\" So Allah revealed: \"Verily! They who spread the Slander are a gang among you. Think it not....\" (24.11-20). When Allah revealed this to confirm my innocence, Abu Bakr As-Siddiq who used to provide for Mistah bin Uthatha because of the latters kinship to him and his poverty, said, \"By Allah, I will never provide for Mistah anything after what he has said about Aisha\". So Allah revealed: (continued...) (continuing... 1): -6.274:... ... \"Let not those among you who are good and are wealthy swear not to give (help) to their kinsmen, those in need, and those who have left their homes for Allahs Cause. Let them Pardon and forgive (i.e. do not punish them). Do you not love that should forgive you? Verily Allah is Oft-forgiving. Most Merciful.\" (24.22) Abu Bakr said, \"Yes, by Allah, I wish that Allah should forgive me.\" So he resumed giving Mistah the aid he used to give him before and said, \"By Allah, I will never withold it from him at all.\" Aisha further said: Allahs Apostle also asked Zainab bint Jahsh about my case. He said, \"O Zainab! What have you seen?\" She replied, \"O Allahs Apostle! I protect my hearing and my sight (by refraining from telling lies). I know nothing but good (about Aisha).\" Of all the wives of Allahs Apostle, it was Zainab who aspired to receive from him the same favor as I used to receive, yet, Allah saved her (from telling lies) because of her piety. But her sister, Hamna, kept on fighting on her behalf so she was destroyed as were those who invented and spread the slander.<D>Narrated Aisha:(the wife of the Prophet) \"Whenever Allahs Apostle intended to go on a journey, he would draw lots amongst his wives and would take with him the one upon whom the lot fell. During a Ghazwa of his, he drew lots amongst us and the lot fell upon me, and I proceeded with him after Allah had decreed the use of the veil by women. I was carried in a Howdah (on the camel) and dismounted while still in it. When Allahs Apostle was through with his Ghazwa and returned home, and we approached the city of Medina, Allahs Apostle ordered us to proceed at night. When the order of setting off was given, I walked till I was past the army to answer the call of nature. After finishing I returned (to the camp) to depart (with the others) and suddenly realized that my necklace over my chest was missing. So, I returned to look for it and was delayed because of that. The people who used to carry me on the camel, came to my Howdah and put it on the back of the camel, thinking that I was in it, as, at that time, women were light in weight, and thin and lean, and did not use to eat much. So, those people did not feel the difference in the heaviness of the Howdah while lifting it, and they put it over the camel. At that time I was a young lady. They set the camel moving and proceeded on. I found my necklace after the army had gone, and came to their camp to find nobody. So, I went to the place where I used to stay, thinking that they would discover my absence and come back in my search. While in that state, I felt sleepy and slept. Safwan bin Muattal As-Sulami Adh-Dhakwani was behind the army and reached my abode in the morning. When he saw a sleeping person, he came to me, and he used to see me before veiling. So, I got up when I heard him saying, \"Inna lil-lah-wa inn a ilaihi rajiun (We are for Allah, and we will return to Him).\" He made his camel knell down. He got down from his camel, and put his leg on the front legs of the camel and then I rode and sat over it. Safwan set out walking, leading the camel by the rope till we reached the army who had halted to take rest at midday. Then whoever was meant for destruction, fell into destruction, (some people accused me falsely) and the leader of the false accusers was `Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul. After that we returned to Medina, and I became ill for one month while the people were spreading the forged statements of the false accusers. I was feeling during my ailment as if I were not receiving the usual kindness from the Prophet which I used to receive from him when I got sick. But he would come, greet and say, How is that (girl)? I did not know anything of what was going on till I recovered from my ailment and went out with Um Mistah to the Manasi where we used to answer the call of nature, and we used not to go to answer the call of nature except from night to night and that was before we had lavatories near to our houses. And this habit of ours was similar to the habit of the old Arabs in the open country (or away from houses). So. I and Um Mistah bint Ruhm went out walking. Um Mistah stumbled because of her long dress and on that she said, Let Mistah be ruined. I said, You are saying a bad word. Why are you abusing a man who took part in (the battle of) Badr? She said, O Hanata (you there) didnt you hear what they said? Then she told me the rumors of the false accusers. My sickness was aggravated, and when I returned home, Allahs Apostle came to me, and after greeting he said, How is that (girl)? I requested him to allow me to go to my parents. I wanted then to be sure of the news through them I Allahs Apostle allowed me, and I went to my parents and asked my mother, What are the people talking about? She said, O my daughter! Dont worry much about this matter. By Allah, never is there a charming woman loved by her husband who has other wives, but the women would forge false news about her. I said, Glorified be Allah! Are the people really taking of this matter? That night I kept on weeping and could not sleep till morning. In the morning Allahs Apostle called `Ali bin Abu Talib and Usama bin Zaid when he saw the Divine Inspiration delayed, to consul them about divorcing his wife (i.e. `Aisha). Usama bin Zaid said what he knew of the good reputation of his wives and added, O Allahs Apostle! Keep you wife, for, by Allah, we know nothing about her but good. `Ali bin Abu Talib said, O Allahs Apostle! Allah has no imposed restrictions on you, and there are many women other than she, yet you may ask the woman-servant who will tell you the truth. On that Allahs Apostle called Buraira and said, O Burair. Did you ever see anything which roused your suspicions about her? Buraira said, No, by Allah Who has sent you with the Truth, I have never seen in her anything faulty except that she is a girl of immature age, who sometimes sleeps and leaves the dough for the goats to eat. On that day Allahs Apostle ascended the pulpit and requested that somebody support him in punishing `Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul. Allahs Apostle said, Who will support me to punish that person (`Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul) who has hurt me by slandering the reputation of my family? By Allah, I know nothing about my family but good, and they have accused a person about whom I know nothing except good, and he never entered my house except in my company. Sa`d bin Mu`adh got up and said, O Allahs Apostle! by Allah, I will relieve you from him. If that man is from the tribe of the Aus, then we will chop his head off, and if he is from our brothers, the Khazraj, then order us, and we will fulfill your order. On that Sa`d bin Ubada, the chief of the Khazraj and before this incident, he had been a pious man, got up, motivated by his zeal for his tribe and said, By Allah, you have told a lie; you cannot kill him, and you will never be able to kill him. On that Usaid bin Al-Hadir got up and said (to Sa`d bin Ubada), By Allah! you are a liar. By Allah, we will kill him; and you are a hypocrite, defending the hypocrites. On this the two tribes of Aus and Khazraj got excited and were about to fight each other, while Allahs Apostle was standing on the pulpit. He got down and quieted them till they became silent and he kept quiet. On that day I kept on weeping so much so that neither did my tears stop, nor could I sleep. In the morning my parents were with me and I had wept for two nights and a day, till I thought my liver would burst from weeping. While they were sitting with me and I was weeping, an Ansari woman asked my permission to enter, and I allowed her to come in. She sat down and started weeping with me. While we were in this state, Allahs Apostle came and sat down and he had never sat with me since the day they forged the accusation. No revelation regarding my case came to him for a month. He recited Tashah-hud (i.e. None has the right to be worshipped but Allah and Muhammad is His Apostle) and then said, O `Aisha! I have been informed such-and-such about you; if you are innocent, then Allah will soon reveal your innocence, and if you have committed a sin, then repent to Allah and ask Him to forgive you, for when a person confesses his sin and asks Allah for forgiveness, Allah accepts his repentance. When Allahs Apostle finished his speech my tears ceased completely and there remained not even a single drop of it. I requested my father to reply to Allahs Apostle on my behalf. My father said, By Allah, I do not know what to say to Allahs Apostle. I said to my mother, Talk to Allahs Apostle on my behalf. She said, By Allah, I do not know what to say to Allahs Apostle. I was a young girl and did not have much knowledge of the Quran. I said. I know, by Allah, that you have listened to what people are saying and that has been planted in your minds and you have taken it as a truth. Now, if I told you that I am innocent and Allah knows that I am innocent, you would not believe me and if I confessed to you falsely that I am guilty, and Allah knows that I am innocent you would believe me. By Allah, I dont compare my situation with you except to the situation of Josephs father (i.e. Jacob) who said, So (for me) patience is most fitting against that which you assert and it is Allah (Alone) whose help can be sought. Then I turned to the other side of my bed hoping that Allah would prove my innocence. By Allah I never thought that Allah would reveal Divine Inspiration in my case, as I considered myself too inferior to be talked of in the Holy Quran. I had hoped that Allahs Apostle might have a dream in which Allah would prove my innocence. By Allah, Allahs Apostle had not got up and nobody had left the house before the Divine Inspiration came to Allahs Apostle. So, there overtook him the same state which used to overtake him, (when he used to have, on being inspired divinely). He was sweating so much so that the drops of the sweat were dropping like pearls though it was a (cold) wintry day. When that state of Allahs Apostle was over, he was smiling and the first word he said, `Aisha! Thank Allah, for Allah has declared your innocence. My mother told me to go to Allahs Apostle . I replied, By Allah I will not go to him and will not thank but Allah. So Allah revealed: \"Verily! They who spread the slander are a gang among you . . .\" (24.11) When Allah gave the declaration of my Innocence, Abu Bakr, who used to provide for Mistah bin Uthatha for he was his relative, said, By Allah, I will never provide Mistah with anything because of what he said about Aisha. But Allah later revealed: -- \"And let not those who are good and wealthy among you swear not to help their kinsmen, those in need and those who left their homes in Allahs Cause. Let them forgive and overlook. Do you not wish that Allah should forgive you? Verily! Allah is Oft-forgiving, Most Merciful.\" (24.22) After that Abu Bakr said, Yes ! By Allah! I like that Allah should forgive me, and resumed helping Mistah whom he used to help before. Allahs Apostle also asked Zainab bint Jahsh (i.e. the Prophets wife about me saying, What do you know and what did you see? She replied, O Allahs Apostle! I refrain to claim hearing or seeing what I have not heard or seen. By Allah, I know nothing except goodness about Aisha.\" Aisha further added \"Zainab was competing with me (in her beauty and the Prophets love), yet Allah protected her (from being malicious), for she had piety.\"<D>Sufyan narrated from Amr bin Dinar that he heard Jabir bin Abdullah sayin:“We were in a battle” – Sufyan said: “They say in was the battle of Banu Mustaliq” – “Aman from the Muhajirin kicked a man from the Ansar. The man from the Muhajirin said: ‘O Muhajirin!’ the man from the Ansar said: ‘O Ansar!’ The Prophet heard that and said: ‘What is this evil call of Jahliyyah?’ They said: ‘A man from the Muhajirin kicked a man from the Ansar.’ So the Prophet said: ‘Leave that, for it is offensive.’ Abdullah bin Ubayy bin Salul heard that and said: ‘Did they really do that? By Allah! If we return to Al-Madinah indeed the more honorable will expel therefrom the meaner.’ Umar said: ‘Allow me to chop off the head of this hypocrite O Messenger of Allah!’ The Prophet said: ‘Leave him, I do not want the people to say that Muhammad kills his Companios.’” Someone other than Amr said: “So his son, Abdullah bin Abdullah, said: ‘By Allah! You shall not return until you say that you are the mean and that the Messenger of Allah is the honorable.’ So he did so.”<D>(Allah hath decreed: Lo! I verily shall conquer, I and My messengers) i.e. Muhammad (pbuh) they shall conquer Persia, Byzantium, the hypocrites and the Jews. (Lo! Allah is Strong) through giving help to his prophets, (Almighty) in retribution against His enemies. This was revealed about Abdullah Ibn Ubayy Ibn Salul who said to the true believers: Do you really think that you shall conquer Persia and Byzantium?.<D>(Thinketh he) does the disbelieving man think (that) because of his strength and force (none hath power over him?) i.e. Allah cannot seize and punish him.<D>(What then is your opinion of the Lord of the Worlds) what do you think He will do to you if you worship other than Him?", "Generated_Answer": "It takes immense courage and self-awareness to articulate what you're feeling, so please know that this is a significant first step towards finding peace. Your feelings are real and valid, even if they seem to contradict your external circumstances.\n\nLet's break down the reason and then explore the treatment.\n\n## The Reason: Why You Feel This Way\n\nWhat you're describing is a classic manifestation of an **inferiority complex**, rooted in **low self-esteem** and an **overactive inner critic**. It's not about the external reality of your life (having friends, family, beauty, money), but rather your **internal perception** and the *lens* through which you view yourself and the world.\n\nHere's why you're experiencing these feelings:\n\n1.  **Internalized Beliefs:** Somewhere along the line, you've developed deep-seated beliefs that you are not \"enough,\" not as good as others, or somehow fundamentally flawed. These beliefs might stem from past experiences (even seemingly minor ones from childhood), comparisons you made, or messages (spoken or unspoken) you received.\n2.  **The Inner Critic:** You have a very strong and loud \"inner critic.\" This is the voice in your head that constantly tells you you're lacking, points out perceived flaws, and jumps to negative conclusions.\n    *   **\"No friend\" despite having them:** Your inner critic is dismissing your actual friendships because it's convinced you're unworthy of them, or it's interpreting normal social dynamics as rejection.\n    *   **Getting serious on small jokes/tension from small things:** Your inner critic is likely interpreting these situations as personal attacks, signs of disrespect, or indicators that you're failing, leading to heightened anxiety and defensiveness.\n    *   **Friends going closer, you feel ignored:** This is a classic cognitive distortion called **personalization**, where you take neutral events and interpret them as being directed at you or being a reflection of your inadequacy. Your inner critic tells you, \"They don't care about you,\" rather than, \"They're just talking.\"\n    *   **Comparing handwriting, etc.:** This is a constant need to find evidence that others are \"better\" than you, fueled by the inner critic's desire to confirm your negative self-belief. You're constantly searching for deficits in yourself.\n3.  **Need for External Validation:** Because your internal self-worth is low, you unconsciously seek external validation (from friends, family, success) to feel good. When you don't get it in the exact way you expect, or when your inner critic interprets interactions negatively, you feel a profound sense of dissatisfaction and rejection.\n4.  **Perfectionism & Unrealistic Expectations:** You might unconsciously hold yourself to impossibly high standards. When you inevitably fall short (as all humans do), your inner critic uses it as \"proof\" of your inadequacy.\n5.  **Anxiety & Overthinking:** The constant negative self-talk and fear of judgment lead to a state of chronic anxiety, making you overthink situations, anticipate rejection, and struggle to be present and peaceful.\n\nIn essence, your heart is not satisfied because the **source of your dissatisfaction is internal**, not external. You are battling your own mind, which is currently operating under a filter of self-criticism and insecurity.\n\n## The Treatment: Steps Towards Peace\n\nThe good news is that these are learned patterns of thinking and feeling, and they can be unlearned. This process requires patience, consistency, and kindness towards yourself.\n\nHere's a multi-faceted approach:\n\n1.  **Become Aware of Your Inner Critic (The First Step):**\n    *   **Identify the Voice:** Start noticing when these negative thoughts appear. \"My friends don't care about me,\" \"My handwriting isn't good enough,\" \"I have no friends.\"\n    *   **Label It:** When you catch it, mentally say, \"Ah, that's my inner critic talking again,\" or \"That's my insecurity speaking.\" This separates *you* from the thought. It's just a thought, not necessarily a truth.\n\n2.  **Challenge Your Thoughts (Cognitive Restructuring):**\n    *   **Is it 100% True?** For thoughts like \"I have no friends,\" ask yourself, \"Is that absolutely true? Do I not have *any* friends? What evidence do I have that contradicts this?\" (e.g., \"Well, I just had coffee with [Friend's Name] yesterday.\")\n    *   **What's Another Interpretation?** When your friends are close and you feel ignored, ask, \"Is it possible they're just having a private conversation, or that I'm not the center of their world at this moment, which is normal?\"\n    *   **What Would I Tell a Friend?** If a friend came to you with the same concern, what compassionate advice would you give them? Apply that same compassion to yourself.\n    *   **Focus on Facts, Not Feelings:** Your feelings are valid, but they don't always reflect objective reality.\n\n3.  **Practice Self-Compassion:**\n    *   **Talk to Yourself Like a Friend:** Instead of criticizing yourself, try comforting yourself. \"It's okay to feel this way. Many people struggle with these feelings.\"\n    *   **Acknowledge Your Humanity:** Everyone makes mistakes, everyone has insecurities, and everyone has areas where others might be \"better\" (and vice versa). This is part of being human.\n    *   **Mindful Self-Compassion:** When you notice yourself feeling inadequate or criticizing yourself, place a hand over your heart, breathe deeply, and offer yourself kind words.\n\n4.  **Focus on Your Strengths and Achievements (Internal Validation):**\n    *   **Create a \"Strengths List\":** Take time to write down everything you like about yourself – your qualities, skills, accomplishments, even small ones. Refer to it often.\n    *   **Celebrate Small Victories:** Did you handle a situation calmly? Did you try something new? Acknowledge these things.\n    *   **Engage in Activities You Enjoy:** Do things that make you feel competent, joyful, or in a \"flow state.\" This builds intrinsic self-worth.\n\n5.  **Limit Social Comparison:**\n    *   **Be Mindful of Social Media:** It's often a curated highlight reel. Remember that everyone has struggles behind their perfect online facade.\n    *   **Shift Your Focus:** Instead of comparing yourself to others, focus on your own growth and progress. Your journey is unique.\n\n6.  **Set Realistic Expectations & Embrace Imperfection:**\n    *   **No One is Perfect:** This includes you. Give yourself permission to be imperfect.\n    *   **Mistakes are Learning Opportunities:** Instead of seeing them as failures, view them as chances to grow.\n\n7.  **Practice Mindfulness and Grounding:**\n    *   **Deep Breathing:** When you feel tension or anxiety, take slow, deep breaths. This calms your nervous system.\n    *   **Focus on the Present:** Engage your five senses. What do you see, hear, smell, taste, feel right now? This pulls you out of overthinking.\n    *   **Meditation:** Even 5-10 minutes of guided meditation daily can help quiet the mind and foster peace.\n\n8.  **Improve Communication (Where Appropriate):**\n    *   Instead of assuming your friends don't care, sometimes it's okay to gently express your feelings *if* you're comfortable. For example, \"Hey, I felt a little left out when you two walked ahead earlier. Did I miss something?\" (This requires trust and timing, so use with caution and only if it feels right). Often, just challenging your *own* assumption is enough.\n\n9.  **Seek Professional Help (Strongly Recommended):**\n    *   A therapist or counselor, particularly one trained in **Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)**, can be incredibly helpful. They can guide you through identifying your negative thought patterns, challenge them effectively, and build healthier coping mechanisms. They provide a safe space to explore the roots of your inferiority complex and help you rewire your brain. This is not a sign of weakness, but a sign of strength and a commitment to your well-being.\n\nThis journey won't be linear, but with consistent effort and self-compassion, you can gradually shift your internal landscape from one of self-criticism and dissatisfaction to one of self-acceptance, peace, and genuine joy. You are worthy of peace, and it's within your reach."}

It goes back to the issue of whether you can validly wipe with the water left on the hands after washing a limb.Many Hanafi scholars held that it is valid to wipe a limb (such as the head) after the water left over from washing another (such as the arms). The sounder opinion, though, as mentioned by Ibn Abidin, is that this is not valid. It is also what caution would indicate. As such, you dont have to make up any prayers performed on such wudus. However, dont do it again", "Document": "Narrated `Abdullah:Allahs Apostle said, \"I saw (in a dream) the people assembled in a gathering, and then Abu Bakr got up and drew one or two buckets of water (from a well) but there was weakness in his drawing.

I had never seen anyone amongst: the people who could draw the water as strongly as `Umar till all the people drank their fill and watered their camels that knelt down there.<D>Narrated Abdullah ibn az-Zubayr:A man disputed with az-Zubayr about streamlets in the lava plain which was irrigated by them. The Ansari said: Release the water and let it run, but az-Zubayr refused. The Holy Prophet () said to az-Zubayr: Water (your ground), Zubayr, then let the water run to your neighbour. The Ansari then became angry and said: Messenger of Allah! it is because he is your cousin!

I think this verse came down about that: \"But no , by thy Lord! they can have no (real) faith, until they make thee judge.....\"<D>It was narrated that Talq bin Ali said:\"We went out as a delegation to the Prophet (); we gave him our oath of allegiance and prayed with him. We told him that in our land there was a church that belonged to us. We asked him to give us the leftovers of his purification (Wudu water). So he called for water, performed Wudu and rinsed out his mouth, then he poured it into a vessel and said to us: Leave, and when you return to your land, demolish your church, and sprinkle this water on that place, and take it as a Masjid. We said: Our land is far away and it is very hot; the water is far away and it is very hot; the water will dry up. He said: Add more water to it, for that will only make it better. So we left and when we came to our land we demolished our church, then we sprinkled the water on that place and took it as a Masjid, and we called the Adhan in it. The monk was a man from Tayy, and when he heard the Adhan, he said: It is a true call. Then he headed toward one of the hills and we never saw him again.\"<D>(And it was said: O earth! Swallow your water) dry your water (and, O sky! be cleared of clouds!) stop your rain! (And the water was made to subside.

You do **not** need to take fresh, new water specifically for the masah.\n    *   Taking new water for the masah is considered **mustahab** (recommended, desirable), meaning it's better and earns more reward, but it is **not obligatory** for the validity of your wudu.\n    *   Therefore, your Hanifi Shaykh was **correct** in telling you that it's okay (inshaAllah) if you are not taking fresh water. Your wudu is valid according to the Hanafi school.\n\n2.  **Why the Confusion (and other Madhahib):**\n    *   Some other madhahib, most notably the **Shafi'i madhhab**, generally require taking *new water* for wiping the head. For them, using the residual wetness from washing the arms might not be considered sufficient unless the hands are still dripping wet.\n    *   The **Maliki** and **Hanbali** madhahib are generally similar to the Hanafi school in that using residual water is sufficient, though taking new water might be considered Sunnah.\n    *   Given these differences, it's natural for someone to feel uncertain if they hear different practices or opinions.\n\n3.  **How Masah is Typically Done (Hanafi Perspective):**\n    *   After washing your arms (including elbows), your hands will be wet.\n    *   You can then immediately use these wet hands to wipe your head.\n    *   **Sunnah (Recommended) Way to Wipe (Hanafi):** Place your wet hands at the front of your head, move them backwards to the nape of your neck, and then bring them forward to the front again.\n    *   **Fard (Obligatory) Way to Wipe (Hanafi):** Wiping at least **one-quarter (rub' al-ra's)** of your head is obligatory. So, even if you just wipe a portion with your wet hands, your wudu is valid.\n\n4.  **Your \"Elbow to Hand\" Concern:**\n    *   You mentioned: \"at least one of my hands should have had fresh water on it from run the faucet water from my elbow to hand and then wiping.\"\n    *   This specific action isn't necessary for the masah. Once you've washed your arms thoroughly as part of the wudu steps, your hands will be wet enough. You don't need to specifically run water *up* your arm *again* just for the masah. The water that was used to wash your arm is already considered \"fresh\" in that context, and the wetness remaining on your hands is sufficient.\n\n**In summary:**\n\nIf you are following the Hanafi madhhab, the practice you described (not taking fresh water specifically for the head wipe, but using the wetness from your hands after washing your arms) is **perfectly valid**, and your wudu is complete and correct. The Shaykh's advice aligns with the Hanafi school's rulings.\n\nWhile taking new water is more virtuous (mustahab), its absence does not invalidate your wudu. Do not let this worry you. May Allah accept your purification and prayers!"}

This prohibition is one of the most clearly established injunctions in the religion, supported by the Quran, the Sunnah (teachings and practices of Prophet Muhammad), and the consensus of Islamic scholars throughout history.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the Islamic view:\n\n1.  **Quranic Prohibition:**\n    The prohibition of alcohol was revealed gradually in the Quran.\n    *   Initially, verses like **Surah Al-Baqarah (2:219)** hinted at its negative aspects: \"They ask you about intoxicants and gambling. Say, 'In them is great sin and [yet, some] benefit for people. But their sin is greater than their benefit.'\"\n    *   Later, Muslims were instructed not to pray while intoxicated in **Surah An-Nisa (4:43)**: \"O you who have believed, do not approach prayer while you are intoxicated until you know what you are saying...\"\n    *   Finally, the definitive prohibition came in **Surah Al-Ma'idah (5:90-91)**, which clearly and absolutely forbade it:\n        *\"O you who have believed! Intoxicants and gambling, [sacrificing on] stone altars [to other than Allah], and divining arrows are but defilement from the work of Satan, so avoid it that you may be successful. Satan only wants to cause animosity and hatred between you through intoxicants and gambling and to avert you from the remembrance of Allah and from prayer. So will you not then desist?\"*\n\n    These verses establish alcohol (referred to as *khamr*, which generally means intoxicant) as an impurity, a work of Satan, and something to be avoided.\n\n2.  **Prophetic Teachings (Sunnah):**\n    Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) further reinforced the prohibition. There are numerous Hadith (sayings and actions of the Prophet) that condemn alcohol in the strongest terms. For example:\n    *   He stated that anything that intoxicates in large quantities is forbidden even in small quantities. This means there's no permissible \"small amount\" of alcohol.\n    *   He cursed ten categories of people involved with alcohol: the one who presses it (for wine), the one for whom it is pressed, the one who drinks it, the one who transports it, the one to whom it is transported, the one who serves it, the one who sells it, the one who consumes its price, the one who buys it, and the one for whom it is bought. This indicates a comprehensive prohibition extending to all aspects of its production and consumption chain.\n\n3.  **Reasons for Prohibition (Wisdom Behind the Law):**\n    The prohibition of alcohol in Islam is not arbitrary; it's seen as a divine wisdom to protect individuals and society. The Quranic verses highlight some key reasons:\n    *   **Averting from Remembrance of Allah and Prayer:** Alcohol impairs judgment and distracts individuals from their religious duties and spiritual connection.\n    *   **Causing Animosity and Hatred:** Intoxication often leads to loss of self-control, arguments, violence, and breakdown of family and community ties.\n    *   **Harm to Mind and Body:** While not explicitly stated as the primary reason in the Quran, the negative effects of alcohol on physical health, mental clarity, and decision-making are well-recognized and align with Islamic principles of protecting life and reason.\n\n4.  **Scope of Prohibition:**\n    The term *khamr* in Islamic jurisprudence extends to any substance that intoxicates, regardless of its source (e.g., wine, beer, spirits, or other drugs that alter the mind). The focus is on the intoxicating effect. Therefore, no amount of any alcoholic beverage is permissible for consumption by a Muslim.\n\n5.  **Consensus (Ijma):**\n    There is an absolute consensus among all mainstream Islamic schools of thought and scholars that alcohol consumption is forbidden (haram). This is one of the very few issues in Islamic law where there is virtually no scholarly disagreement.\n\n**In summary:** For Muslims, alcohol consumption is considered a major sin. Adhering to this prohibition is seen as an act of obedience to God, a means of protecting oneself and one's community from harm, and a way to maintain spiritual clarity and focus on one's religious duties. While some individuals who identify as Muslim may consume alcohol, this is understood within Islamic jurisprudence as a deviation from clear religious injunctions, not an acceptance or permissibility of alcohol use within the faith itself."}

Let's break this down based on Islamic principles:\n\n1.  **Validity of Ghusl and Wudoo:**\n    *   For ghusl to be valid, water must reach every part of the outer body. This includes behind the ears.\n    *   For wudoo, water must reach the specific limbs and parts (face, hands, head, feet).\n\n2.  **Regarding \"Scratchable Dots\" or \"Scabs\":**\n    *   **Did they prevent water from reaching the skin?** This is the key question.\n        *   **Most common scenario:** Small scabs, dried skin, or minor bumps generally *do not* prevent water from reaching the skin underneath. Water flows over them, around them, and often permeates them sufficiently, especially during ghusl where water is generously applied and often rubbed. Unless it was a very thick, hardened, non-porous layer (like dried paint or superglue), it's highly unlikely it prevented water.\n        *   Given that you *felt* them and they were \"scratchable dots,\" it's very probable that water reached the skin.\n\n3.  **The Act of Scratching *After* Ghusl/Wudoo:**\n    *   You mentioned you scratched one *after* ghusl and *after* wudoo. This is crucial.\n    *   If your ghusl and wudoo were valid *before* you scratched, then scratching something off *after* they were completed does not invalidate them retroactively. It's like peeling a piece of dry skin off – it doesn't break your wudoo or make your previous ghusl invalid.\n\n**Conclusion and What You Should Do:**\n\nBased on your description, it is highly likely that your ghusl and wudoo are valid, and **you do not need to do anything.**\n\n*   **Your ghusl was most likely valid:** Water almost certainly reached the skin behind your ear despite the presence of those minor dots/scabs.\n*   **The scratching happened *after* the fact:** What you did after completing your rituals doesn't undo the validity of those rituals.\n*   **Don't overthink minor details:** Islam is a religion of ease. If you performed your ghusl and wudoo to the best of your ability and don't have *certainty* that water did not reach a specific part due to an impermeable barrier, then assume your taharah is valid. Constant doubt can lead to unnecessary hardship (waswasah).\n\nSo, rest assured, your taharah is fine, and you don't need to repeat anything."}

It requires patience, self-compassion, and consistent effort. Here's a comprehensive guide on what a person in this situation can do:\n\n**I. Understand and Acknowledge**\n\n1.  **Recognize the Problem:** The first step is to acknowledge that these feelings are present and that they are impacting your life negatively. This is a sign of strength, not weakness.\n2.  **Identify the Roots (Optional but Helpful):** While not always necessary to overcome, sometimes understanding where these feelings came from (e.g., childhood experiences, critical parents, bullying, past failures, societal pressures) can provide context and help you reframe them.\n3.  **Separate Feelings from Facts:** Just because you *feel* inferior or inadequate doesn't mean it's true. Our feelings are powerful but not always accurate reflections of reality.\n\n**II. Shift Your Mindset (Cognitive Strategies)**\n\n4.  **Challenge Negative Self-Talk:**\n    *   **Become Aware:** Pay attention to the critical voice in your head. Write down the common phrases it uses (\"I'm not good enough,\" \"I always fail,\" \"No one likes me\").\n    *   **Question It:** Ask yourself: \"Is this thought 100% true?\" \"What's the evidence for this thought?\" \"What's the evidence against it?\" \"Is there another way to look at this?\"\n    *   **Reframe:** Replace negative thoughts with more balanced or realistic ones. Instead of \"I'm a failure,\" try \"I made a mistake, and I can learn from it.\" Instead of \"I'm unlovable,\" try \"I am capable of love and connection.\"\n5.  **Focus on Strengths and Achievements:**\n    *   **Make a \"Win List\":** Regularly list your accomplishments, no matter how small. From making your bed to finishing a complex project at work, acknowledge your capabilities.\n    *   **Identify Your Strengths:** What are you good at? What positive qualities do you possess (e.g., kindness, resilience, creativity, problem-solving)? Ask trusted friends or family for their perspectives if you struggle to see them.\n6.  **Practice Self-Compassion:**\n    *   **Treat Yourself Like a Friend:** If a friend were struggling, how would you talk to them? Offer yourself the same kindness, understanding, and encouragement.\n    *   **Acknowledge Imperfection:** Understand that everyone makes mistakes and has flaws. It's part of being human. Self-worth isn't dependent on perfection.\n7.  **Limit Social Comparison:**\n    *   **Be Mindful of Social Media:** Remember that people often curate idealized versions of their lives online. Comparing your entire life to someone else's highlight reel is a recipe for low self-esteem.\n    *   **Focus on Your Own Path:** Your journey is unique. Celebrate your progress without measuring it against others.\n8.  **Practice Gratitude:** Regularly list things you are grateful for – your health, loved ones, small joys, opportunities. This shifts focus from what you lack to what you have.\n\n**III. Take Action (Behavioral Strategies)**\n\n9.  **Set Small, Achievable Goals:**\n    *   **Build Momentum:** Start with very small, manageable tasks. Successfully completing them builds confidence and a sense of accomplishment. Gradually increase the difficulty.\n    *   **Celebrate Successes:** Acknowledge and celebrate every goal you achieve, no matter how minor.\n10. **Engage in Activities You Enjoy and Excel At:**\n    *   **Rediscover Hobbies:** Spend time doing things that bring you joy, satisfaction, or a sense of mastery. This can be anything from painting, gardening, playing music, or solving puzzles.\n    *   **Learn New Skills:** Learning new things, even if you're not an expert, can boost confidence and a sense of competence.\n11. **Help Others:** Volunteering, supporting a friend, or performing small acts of kindness can shift your focus outward, provide a sense of purpose, and remind you of your positive impact on the world.\n12. **Practice Assertiveness:**\n    *   **Set Boundaries:** Learn to say \"no\" when necessary and protect your time and energy.\n    *   **Express Your Needs:** Communicate your thoughts, feelings, and needs respectfully but clearly. This builds self-respect.\n13. **Take Care of Your Physical Health:**\n    *   **Exercise:** Regular physical activity can significantly improve mood, reduce stress, and boost energy levels.\n    *   **Healthy Diet:** Fuel your body with nutritious food.\n    *   **Adequate Sleep:** Lack of sleep can exacerbate feelings of anxiety and inadequacy.\n    *   **Good Hygiene & Appearance:** Taking care of your physical self can positively impact how you feel about yourself.\n\n**IV. Seek Support**\n\n14. **Talk to Trusted People:** Share your feelings with a supportive friend, family member, mentor, or spiritual advisor. Simply articulating what you're going through can be immensely helpful, and receiving validation from others can be powerful.\n15. **Consider Professional Help:**\n    *   **Therapy/Counseling:** A therapist (e.g., a psychologist, licensed counselor) can provide a safe space to explore the roots of your low self-esteem, help you identify and challenge negative thought patterns (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy - CBT is often very effective), develop coping strategies, and build healthier self-perceptions.\n    *   **Support Groups:** Connecting with others who share similar struggles can create a sense of belonging and reduce feelings of isolation.\n    *   **Medication (if applicable):** If severe anxiety, depression, or other co-occurring mental health conditions are present, a doctor or psychiatrist might discuss medication as part of a comprehensive treatment plan.\n\n**V. Remember It's a Journey**\n\n16. **Be Patient with Yourself:** Building self-esteem and overcoming an inferiority complex is not an overnight fix. There will be good days and bad days. Progress is rarely linear.\n17. **Celebrate Small Wins:** Acknowledge and celebrate every step forward, no matter how small.\n18. **Persistence is Key:** Keep practicing these strategies even when it feels difficult. Consistency leads to lasting change.\n\nIf you are struggling significantly, please prioritize reaching out to a mental health professional. They can provide personalized guidance and support tailored to your specific situation."}

I tied the water skin of Allahs Apostle with one part, and with the other part I tied his food container.\"<D>Said b. jubair reported:I said to Ibn Abbas that Nauf al-Bikali was of the opinion that Moses (peace be upon him), the Apostle of Bani Israil, was not the same who accompanied Khadir, whereupon he said: The enemy of Allah tells a lie. I heard Ubayy b. Kab say: Moses (peace be upon him) stood up to give sermon to the people of Israil. He was asked as to who amongst the people has the best knowledge, whereupon he said: I have the best knowledge. Thereupon Allah was annoyed with him that he did not attribute (the best knowledge) to Him. He revealed to him: A servant amongst My servants is at the junction of two rivers who has more knowledge than yours. Moses said: How can I meet him? It was said to him: Carry a fish in the large basket and the place where you find it missing there you will find him. Thereupon Moses proceeded forth along with a young man (Yusha). Joshua b. Nan and Moses (peace be upon him) put the fish in the basket and there went along with him the young man (Yusha) until they came to a certain rock and Moses and his companion went to sleep and the fish stirred in that basket and fell into the ocean and Allah stopped the current of water like a vault until the way was made for the fish. Moses and his youn. companion were astonished and they walked for the rest of the day and the night and the friend of Moses forgot to inform him of this incident. When it was morning, Moses (peace be upon him) said to the young man: Bring for us the breakfast for we are dead tired because of this journey, and they did not feel exhausted until they had passed that place where they had been commanded (to stay). He said: Dont you know that when we reached the Sakhra (rock) I forgot the fisii and noth ng made me forget it but the satan that I. could nit remember it? How strange is it that the fish found a way in the river? Moses said: That was what we had been aiming at. Then both of them retraced their steps until they reached Sakhra; there they saw a man covered with a cloth. Moses greeted him. Khadir said to him: Where is as-Salam in our country.? He said: I am Moses, whereupon he (Khadir) said: You mean the Moses of Bani Israil? He said: Yes. He (Khadir) said: You have a knowledge out of the knowledge of Allah which in fact Allah imparted to you and about that I know nothing and I have knowledge out of Allahs knowledge which He imparted to me and about that you do not know. Moses (peace be upon him) said to him: May I follow you so that you may teach me that with which you have been taught righteousness. He said: You will not be able to bear with me; how you will be able to bear that about which you do not know? Moses said: Thou wilt find me patient, nor shalt I disobey you in aught. Khadir said to him: If you were to follow me, then do not ask me about anything until I myself speak to you about it. He said: Yes. So Khadir and Moses set forth on the bank of the river that there came before them a boat. Both of theni talked to them (the owners of the boat) so that they might carry both of them. They had recognised Khadir and they carried them free. Khadir thereupon took hold of a plank in the boat and broke it away. Moses said: These people have carried us without any charge and you attempt to break their boat so that the people sailing in the boat may drown. This is (something) grievous that you have done. He said: Did I not say that you would not bear with me? He said: Blame me not for what I forgot and be not hard upon what I did. Then both of them got down from the boat and began to walk along the coastline that they saw a boy who had been playing with other boys. Khadir pulled up his head and killed him. Moses said: Have you killed an innocent person who is in no way guilty of slaying another? You have done something horrible. Thereupon he said: Did I not say to you that you will not be able to bear with me? He (Moses) said: This (act) is more grievous than the first one. He (Moses) further said. If I ask you about anything after this, keep not company with me, then you would no doubt find (a plausible) excuse for this. Then they both walked on until they reached the inhabitants of a village. They asked its inhabitants for food but they refused to entertain them as their guests. They found in it a wall which had been bent on one side and was about to fall. Khadir set it right with his own hand. Moses, said to him: It is the people to whom we came but they showed us no hospitality and they did not serve us food. If you wish you can get wages for it. He (Khadir) said: This is the parting of ways between mt and you. Now I wish to reveal to you the significance of that for which you could not bear with me. Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) said. May Allah have mercy upon Moses! I wish if Moses could show patience and a (fuller) story of both of them could have been told. Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) said that the first thing which Moses said was out of forgetfulness. Then there came a sparrow until it perched on the wall of the boat and took water from the ocean. Thereupon, Khadir said: My knowledge and your knowledge in comparison with the knowledge of Allah is even less than the water taken by the sparrow in its beak in comparison to the water of the ocean, and Said b. jubair used to recite (verses 79 and 80 of Sura Kahf) in this way: There was before them a king who used to seize every boat by force which was in order, the boy was an unbeliever.<D>It was narrated that Mughirah bin Shubah said:\"The Prophet went out to relieve himself and when he came back, I met him with a water skin and poured water for him. He washed his hands and his face, then he went to wash his forearms but his garment was too tight, so he brought his arms out from underneath his garment and washed them, then he wiped over his leather socks, then he led us in prayer.\"<D>(And the cattle) i.e. the camels (hath He created, whence ye have warm clothing) made of their skin (and uses) you drink their milk and use them as a means of transport, (and whereof ye eat) and you eat their meat.<D>(Have they not seen) do the people of Mecca not know (how We lead the water to the barren land) wherein there is no vegetation (and therewith) with the water (bring forth crops whereof) from the grass (their cattle eat, and they themselves) eat from the grains, fruits and legumes? (Will they not then see) do they notknow it is from Allah?<D>(On honoured leaves) He says: the Quran is written on scrolls made of skin which are honoured in the sight of Allah", "Generated_Answer": "This is an excellent and very common question, and you're right, it touches upon a crucial Islamic principle regarding doubt and certainty. Don't apologize for asking a complicated question; these are often the most beneficial ones!\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n---\n\n### 1. Regarding the Specific Example: Dead Skin & Wudu\n\nGenerally, *unattached* dead skin or skin that is flaking off is **not considered a barrier** for Wudu. The water is expected to reach the living skin underneath. The requirement is to wash the *skin itself*, and minor, natural flaking or dead cells are not considered a separate, impermeable layer like nail polish or wax that would prevent water from reaching the surface.\n\nTherefore, in your specific scenario:\n*   If you perform Wudu and have dead skin that is unattached or flaking, your Wudu is generally considered **valid**.\n*   You can pray with that Wudu.\n\nSo, for this particular question, you likely **don't need to worry** and can assume your Wudu is acceptable.\n\n---\n\n### 2. What to Do When You Don't Know (General Principle)\n\nThis is where the core of your question lies, and Islam provides clear guidance through a fundamental legal maxim:\n\n**\"Certainty is not removed by doubt.\" (اليقين لا يزول بالشك - *Al-Yaqeen la yazul bish-shakk*)**\n\nThis maxim is the bedrock for dealing with doubt in Islamic law, especially concerning acts of worship (*ibadah*). Here's how it applies:\n\n**A. If you were certain about something, and then you doubt it:**\n*   **The certainty remains, and the doubt is ignored.**\n*   **Example 1 (Wudu):** You are certain you had Wudu. Then you doubt, \"Did I break my Wudu (e.g., pass gas)?\" If you are not *certain* you broke it, then your Wudu is still valid. You carry on as if you still have Wudu.\n*   **Example 2 (Purity of clothes):** You are certain your clothes are pure. Then you doubt, \"Did some impurity get on them?\" If you are not *certain* impurity got on them, your clothes are still pure.\n\n**B. If you were certain about the *absence* of something, and then you doubt its *presence*:**\n*   **The certainty of absence remains, and the doubt is ignored.**\n*   **Example:** You are certain you *don't* have Wudu (because you haven't performed it yet). You then doubt, \"Did I accidentally perform Wudu while sleepy?\" You are still considered to *not* have Wudu until you are certain you performed it correctly.\n\n**C. If you are uncertain from the beginning (which is closer to your \"dead skin\" example, if you truly didn't know the ruling):**\n\nIn cases where you don't know the specific ruling on an issue that affects the validity of your worship, and you are waiting for an answer, here's the approach:\n\n1.  **Act upon the Default/Original State (*Istishab*):**\n    *   The general default in Islam is ease and permissibility, unless explicitly stated otherwise.\n    *   For acts of worship, the default is that a condition is met unless there is a clear, certain impediment. In the \"dead skin\" case, the default is water reaching the skin, and dead skin isn't a known impediment.\n\n2.  **Act Upon the Dominant Probability (*Ghalabat al-Dhann*):**\n    *   If, based on common knowledge, or the general understanding of the religion (e.g., Allah intends ease, not hardship), one side of the doubt seems much more likely, you act upon that stronger probability.\n    *   For instance, if 9 out of 10 scholars or religious guides would say \"X\" is permissible, you would act on \"X\" being permissible while awaiting a definitive answer.\n\n3.  **Seek Knowledge and Don't Delay Worship:**\n    *   You did exactly the right thing by asking the question. While you are waiting:\n        *   **Do not delay your prayer.** Performing the prayer on time, even with a minor doubt that is being investigated, is generally preferred over delaying it.\n        *   Perform your Wudu/Ghusl to the best of your ability, following what you *do* know and applying the principles of \"certainty not removed by doubt\" and \"dominant probability.\"\n        *   If, after prayer, you receive an answer that definitively states your Wudu/Ghusl was invalid (e.g., \"Yes, dead skin *is* a barrier, and you must scrape it off completely\"), then you would be required to **make up (qada')** those prayers. This is the safety net. However, for most minor issues, this is often not the case.\n\n4.  **Avoid Excessive Precaution (*Waswasa*):**\n    *   Sometimes, being overly cautious can lead to *waswasa* (whispers from Shaytan, obsessive doubts). If you keep re-doing Wudu or questioning its validity for minor, unfounded reasons, you are falling into *waswasa*, which is detrimental to one's faith and peace of mind. Islam is a religion of ease, not hardship.\n\n---\n\n### Conclusion for your situation:\n\nFor the \"dead skin\" specific question, you can be assured that your Wudu is generally valid, and you should pray with it.\n\nFor the broader question of \"What to do when you don't know\":\n*   **Do not let doubt paralyze you or cause you to miss worship.**\n*   **Act upon certainty, ignore doubt.** If you were certain of something (like Wudu), it remains certain until you are certain it broke.\n*   **Act upon the dominant probability** if the issue is about a ruling you're unsure of.\n*   **Seek knowledge**, but in the meantime, fulfill your obligations to the best of your ability.\n*   If a definitive answer later proves your previous act of worship invalid, make up the missed prayers.\n\nThis approach ensures you continue your worship, avoid hardship, and maintain peace of mind while diligently seeking correct knowledge."}
{"Question": "Q: We have seen a house, which we like to rent, but we found out that the last people who rented this house were prostitutes! Is it alright to move there and read prayers in there? ? --T--", "Answer": "It is permissible. Refer to http://muftionline.co.za/node/2508 And Allah Taala ( ) knows best", "Document": "Abu Zura reported:I visited the house of Marwan in the company of Abu Huraira and he found pictures there. whereupon he said: I heard Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: Allah, the Glorious and Exalted, said: Who is a more wrongdoer than one who tries to create creation like Mine creation. Let him create an atom or a grain of wheat or that of barley. This hadith has been transmitted on the authority of Abu Zura and he said: Abu Huraira went to the house of Sald or Marwan which they had built in Medina and he (Abu Huraira) saw a painter who had been painting pictures in his house, whereupon he told that Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) had said like this, but he made no mention of the words:\" Let him create the grain of barley.\"<D>Narrated Samura bin Jundab:Whenever the Prophet finished the (morning) prayer, he would face us and ask, \"Who amongst you had a dream last night?\" So if anyone had seen a dream he would narrate it. The Prophet would say: \"Ma shaa-llah\" (An Arabic maxim meaning literally, What Allah wished, and it indicates a good omen.) One day, he asked us whether anyone of us had seen a dream. We replied in the negative. The Prophet said, \"But I had seen (a dream) last night that two men came to me, caught hold of my hands, and took me to the Sacred Land (Jerusalem). There, I saw a person sitting and another standing with an iron hook in his hand pushing it inside the mouth of the former till it reached the jawbone, and then tore off one side of his cheek, and then did the same with the other side; in the meantime the first side of his cheek became normal again and then he repeated the same operation again. I said, What is this? They told me to proceed on and we went on till we came to a man Lying flat on his back, and another man standing at his head carrying a stone or a piece of rock, and crushing the head of the Lying man, with that stone. Whenever he struck him, the stone rolled away. The man went to pick it up and by the time he returned to him, the crushed head had returned to its normal state and the man came back and struck him again (and so on). I said, Who is this? They told me to proceed on; so we proceeded on and passed by a hole like an oven; with a narrow top and wide bottom, and the fire was kindling underneath that hole. Whenever the fire-flame went up, the people were lifted up to such an extent that they about to get out of it, and whenever the fire got quieter, the people went down into it, and there were naked men and women in it. I said, Who is this? They told me to proceed on. So we proceeded on till we reached a river of blood and a man was in it, and another man was standing at its bank with stones in front of him, facing the man standing in the river. Whenever the man in the river wanted to come out, the other one threw a stone in his mouth and caused him to retreat to his original position; and so whenever he wanted to come out the other would throw a stone in his mouth, and he would retreat to his original position. I asked, What is this? They told me to proceed on and we did so till we reached a well-flourished green garden having a huge tree and near its root was sitting an old man with some children. (I saw) Another man near the tree with fire in front of him and he was kindling it up. Then they (i.e. my two companions) made me climb up the tree and made me enter a house, better than which I have ever seen. In it were some old men and young men, women and children. Then they took me out of this house and made me climb up the tree and made me enter another house that was better and superior (to the first) containing old and young people. I said to them (i.e. my two companions), You have made me ramble all the night. Tell me all about that I have seen. They said, Yes. As for the one whose cheek you saw being torn away, he was a liar and he used to tell lies, and the people would report those lies on his authority till they spread all over the world. So, he will be punished like that till the Day of Resurrection. The one whose head you saw being crushed is the one whom Allah had given the knowledge of Quran (i.e. knowing it by heart) but he used to sleep at night (i.e. he did not recite it then) and did not use to act upon it (i.e. upon its orders etc.) by day; and so this punishment will go on till the Day of Resurrection. And those you saw in the hole (like oven) were adulterers (those men and women who commit illegal sexual intercourse). And those you saw in the river of blood were those dealing in Riba (usury). And the old man who was sitting at the base of the tree was Abraham and the little children around him were the offspring of the people. And the one who was kindling the fire was Malik, the gatekeeper of the Hell-fire. And the first house in which you have gone was the house of the common believers, and the second house was of the martyrs. I am Gabriel and this is Michael. Raise your head. I raised my head and saw a thing like a cloud over me. They said, That is your place. I said, Let me enter my place. They said, You still have some life which you have not yet completed, and when you complete (that remaining portion of your life) you will then enter your place. \"<D>Narrated AbuHurayrah:The Messenger of Allah () said: Gabriel () came to me and said: I came to you last night and was prevented from entering simply because there were images at the door, for there was a decorated curtain with images on it in the house, and there was a dog in the house. So order the head of the image which is in the house to be cut off so that it resembles the form of a tree; order the curtain to be cut up and made into two cushions spread out on which people may tread; and order the dog to be turned out.

Sins are actions, not physical substances that render a place impure.\n    *   **Important Precaution:** Given the nature of the previous occupants, it is highly recommended to perform a thorough physical cleaning of the entire house, especially areas where impurities might have been present (e.g., bodily fluids). Once physically clean, the house is suitable for prayer.\n\n2.  **Changing the Environment:**\n    *   Your intention to move in and establish a righteous household, filled with prayers and good deeds, is highly commendable.\n    *   Your presence, your prayers, and the recitation of the Quran will, God willing, bring blessings (barakah) and purify the spiritual atmosphere of the house, transforming it from a place of sin into a dwelling of worship and righteousness.\n    *   The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) said: \"Do not make your houses graves. Indeed, Shaytan flees from the house in which Surat Al-Baqarah is recited.\" (Muslim) This highlights the power of righteous acts and Quran recitation in sanctifying a dwelling.\n\n3.  **Moral Stigma vs. Religious Prohibitions:**\n    *   While there might be a social or moral stigma associated with the house due to its past, this does not translate into a religious prohibition against living there or praying there, *provided you are not participating in or condoning the past activities*.\n    *   Your act of moving in is to establish a home for yourself, not to perpetuate or glorify the previous activities.\n\n**In summary:**\n\n*   **Move In:** Yes, it is alright to move into the house. Ensure a thorough physical cleaning is done for hygiene and peace of mind.\n*   **Prayers:** Yes, it is absolutely alright and encouraged to pray in the house. As long as the specific spot where you are praying is physically clean, your prayers will be valid. Your prayers and good deeds will help purify the spiritual atmosphere of the house.\n\nFocus on your good intentions and your commitment to establishing a righteous home.

It is generally understood as:\n    *   **Spending on what is Haram (forbidden).** (Oudh/attar is Halal).\n    *   **Spending excessively to the point of neglecting one's essential needs or the needs of one's dependents.**\n    *   **Spending beyond one's means, leading to debt or financial hardship.**\n    *   **Wasting resources without benefit or purpose.**\n    *   **Spending for show-off (riya') or arrogance, rather than for personal use or pleasure within permissible bounds.**\n\n2.  **Key Factors to Consider for Permissibility:**\n\n    *   **Your Financial Capability:** This is the most crucial factor.\n        *   **Are your basic needs met?** (Food, housing, clothing, healthcare, education for your children).\n        *   **Are your financial obligations fulfilled?** (Debts, loans, Zakat).\n        *   **Do you have an emergency fund or savings?**\n        *   If all these are securely met, and you have genuine disposable income, then spending on a luxury item like high-quality Oudh is generally permissible. What is \"large\" for one person might be a minor expenditure for another, depending on their wealth.\n\n    *   **Intention (Niyyah):**\n        *   Are you buying it for personal enjoyment, cleanliness, or to follow the Sunnah of using good scents? These are permissible intentions.\n        *   Are you buying it solely to show off to others or to flaunt wealth? While the act itself might not be Haram, the intention of showing off (riya') can diminish its spiritual value and is generally disliked.\n\n    *   **Moderation and Balance:**\n        *   Is this a one-off purchase, or are you constantly spending disproportionately on luxury items to the neglect of other important aspects of your life (e.g., charity, investment, family needs)?\n        *   Islam encourages balance. Enjoying the good things of life that Allah has provided is permissible, as long as it doesn't lead to heedlessness or neglect of duties.\n\n    *   **The Sunnah of Perfume:**\n        *   The Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) loved perfume and encouraged its use, especially on Fridays and for prayer. He reportedly used musk and other good scents. This indicates that using good fragrance is something encouraged in Islam. While not specifically about *expensive* perfume, it shows the value placed on it.\n\n    *   **Value Proposition:**\n        *   High-quality Oudh and attars are often highly concentrated and last for a very long time, meaning a small bottle can provide many applications over years. In this sense, while the initial cost is high, the cost per use might be considered reasonable for a luxury item.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nIt is **permissible** to spend large amounts of money on small bottles of high-quality attar (like Hindi Oudh) **if**:\n\n1.  **You can genuinely afford it** without neglecting your essential needs, the needs of your dependents, or your financial obligations (debts, Zakat).\n2.  Your intention is primarily for **personal enjoyment, cleanliness, or to follow the Sunnah**, and not purely for ostentation or showing off.\n3.  This expenditure does not become a pattern of **reckless spending** that leads to financial instability or neglects more important responsibilities.\n\nIf spending R10,000 on a bottle of Oudh means you can't pay your rent, buy groceries for your family, or fulfill your Zakat, then it would be considered extravagance and impermissible. However, if you are financially secure, have met all your obligations, and enjoy such luxuries within reason, Islam does not forbid you from enjoying the good things Allah has provided."}

The differing views stem from interpretations of the Quran and Hadith (sayings and actions of Prophet Muhammad).\n\nHere's a breakdown of the main perspectives:\n\n**1. The View That Music is Generally Forbidden (Haram):**\n\n*   **Basis:** This view often cites certain verses in the Quran (e.g., Surah Luqman 31:6, which speaks of \"idle talk\" or \"amusements of discourse,\" though the interpretation of this verse regarding music is debated) and several Hadith that are interpreted as condemning musical instruments, particularly wind and string instruments.\n*   **Arguments:**\n    *   Music can distract a person from the remembrance of Allah (Dhikr) and religious duties.\n    *   It can lead to heedlessness, indulging in sinful activities, and promoting indecency, especially when combined with certain lyrics or social environments.\n    *   Some Hadith mention the prohibition of musical instruments specifically.\n*   **Scholars:** Many classical scholars, particularly from the Hanbali school of thought, and some contemporary scholars adhere to this stricter view, considering most forms of music to be forbidden. They often make an exception only for the *duff* (a type of tambourine) in specific celebratory contexts like weddings or Eid.\n\n**2. The View That Music is Generally Permissible (Halal) with Conditions:**\n\n*   **Basis:** This view argues that there is no explicit, unequivocal prohibition of *all* music in the Quran. They interpret the Hadith that seem to forbid music as referring to specific types of music that are associated with sin, indecency, or lead to forbidden activities (like excessive partying, alcohol consumption, or illicit mixing of genders).\n*   **Arguments:**\n    *   The Quran does not explicitly forbid music. The verse in Surah Luqman is interpreted by them as referring to anything that diverts one from Allah, not specifically music.\n    *   There are Hadith that indicate the permissibility of singing and playing the duff, especially during celebrations like Eid or weddings. This suggests a general permissibility unless there's a reason for prohibition.\n    *   Music, in its essence, can be a form of expressing beauty, joy, and even inspiring good, devotion, or learning (e.g., educational songs, nasheeds).\n*   **Conditions for Permissibility:**\n    *   **Content (Lyrics):** The lyrics must not contain anything un-Islamic, such as promoting shirk (polytheism), indecency, violence, sin, or rebellion against Islamic teachings.\n    *   **Context:** It should not be used in a context that leads to forbidden acts (e.g., excessive partying, consumption of alcohol, illicit mixing of genders).\n    *   **Moderation:** It should not distract from one's religious duties (like prayer) or become an addiction that consumes one's time and resources.\n    *   **Effect:** It should not lead to arousal, lust, or other negative emotions that might incite sin.\n*   **Scholars:** Many contemporary scholars and some classical scholars (like those from the Maliki and Shafi'i schools, and Ibn Hazm from the Zahiri school) lean towards this view.\n\n**3. The Middle Ground/Nuanced View:**\n\n*   Many scholars hold a nuanced position that distinguishes between different types of music and their effects.\n*   They generally agree that vocal music (singing) without instruments, or with only simple percussion (like the duff), is permissible, especially if the lyrics are wholesome.\n*   They often differentiate between \"music\" (ghina) that incites sin or heedlessness, which is forbidden, and \"singing\" or \"chanting\" that is spiritually uplifting, educational, or simply entertaining in a permissible way, which is allowed.\n*   The use of complex musical instruments (string, wind, brass) is where the most significant disagreement lies, with some allowing them provided the conditions above are met, and others still restricting them to specific types.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nGiven the diversity of scholarly opinions, it is common for Muslims to follow different practices regarding music.\n\n*   **Strict Adherence:** Some devout Muslims choose to avoid most forms of music and musical instruments to err on the side of caution and avoid anything potentially doubtful.\n*   **Conditional Permissibility:** Many Muslims listen to music that adheres to the conditions mentioned above (wholesome lyrics, no sinful context, not distracting from religious duties). They might prefer *nasheeds* (Islamic vocal music) or other forms of music that uplift or inspire rather than incite.\n\nUltimately, it is a matter of personal conviction and following the guidance of a scholar one trusts, ensuring that one's choices align with the overall spirit of Islam, which encourages remembrance of God, good deeds, and avoidance of sin."}

", "Generated_Answer": "This question touches on two related but distinct issues: the permissibility of the \"Fatiha\" ritual itself, and the permissibility of eating food associated with it.\n\nLet's break down each part:\n\n### 1. Is \"Fatiha\" Permissible in Islam?\n\nThe term \"Fatiha\" in this context refers to a specific ritual widely practiced in some parts of the world, particularly South Asia, where people gather, recite certain chapters or verses from the Quran (including Surah Al-Fatiha), make a supplication (dua), and often distribute or consume food, usually with the intention of sending rewards to the deceased or seeking blessings for a specific purpose.\n\nFrom an Islamic jurisprudential perspective, the vast majority of scholars who adhere strictly to the Quran and Sunnah consider this specific ritual of \"Fatiha\" to be a **Bid'ah (innovation)**. Here's why:\n\n*   **No Basis in Sunnah:** The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him), his companions (Sahaba), and the early generations of Muslims (Salaf) did not practice or teach such a ritual. They would make dua for the deceased, give charity (sadaqa) on their behalf, and visit graves, but not in this specific ceremonial manner with fixed timings, specific food, or gatherings for this purpose.\n*   **Fixing Specifics of Worship:** While reciting Quran, making dua, and giving charity are all highly virtuous acts in Islam, combining them into a specific ritual with fixed procedures, times (e.g., 3rd day, 7th day, 40th day, yearly anniversary), and associated food, and believing that this *specific method* is necessary or particularly efficacious, falls under innovation in worship.\n*   **Good Intention Does Not Justify Innovation:** Even if people perform it with good intentions (like sending reward to the deceased or seeking blessings), a good intention does not make an innovated act of worship permissible. The Prophet (PBUH) said: \"Whoever innovates into this affair of ours (Islam) that which is not part of it, will have it rejected.\" (Bukhari, Muslim)\n\nTherefore, the ritualistic \"Fatiha\" as described is generally considered **not permissible** in Islam by mainstream scholars who advocate for strict adherence to the Quran and Sunnah.\n\n### 2. Is it Permissible to Eat the Food Which is Given in Fatiha?\n\nThis is a more nuanced question. The permissibility of the food itself depends on a few factors:\n\n*   **Source of the Food:** If the food itself is halal (permissible ingredients, lawfully acquired), then there's no issue with the food itself from that perspective.\n*   **Intention Behind the Food's Preparation:**\n    *   If the food is prepared with the explicit intention of being offered to other than Allah (e.g., to a saint, a prophet, a jinn, etc.) in a manner that constitutes shirk (polytheism), then consuming such food would be forbidden. However, in the context of \"Fatiha,\" the intention is usually to send reward to the deceased or seek blessings from Allah, not to offer it to the deceased person themselves as an act of worship.\n    *   If the food is prepared as an intrinsic part of the innovated \"Fatiha\" ritual, with the belief that this food is consecrated in a special way necessary for the ritual's validity or for blessings to descend, then consuming it can be seen as participating in and condoning the innovation.\n    *   If the food is simply charity (sadaqa) given in memory of the deceased, without being tied to the innovated ritualistic aspects, then giving and receiving such food would be permissible and commendable.\n\n### 3. What is the Hukum (Ruling) for the Food if We Receive It?\n\nBased on the above, the ruling for the food can be categorized:\n\n*   **Scenario 1: You are attending the Fatiha gathering and food is served as part of the ritual.**\n    *   **Stronger Opinion (Preferred):** Many scholars advise against participating in eating the food in this setting, as it can be interpreted as condoning or participating in the Bid'ah. It's best to politely decline if possible, or leave before the food is served. This is to distance oneself from the innovation and not contribute to its perpetuation.\n    *   **Contextual Considerations:** If declining would cause significant social harm, offense, or misunderstanding (e.g., you are a guest in a remote area and it's the only food available, or it would break family ties beyond repair), some scholars allow eating the food, but one should internally disapprove of the innovation and not believe in its validity. This is a concession for specific difficult situations, not a general allowance.\n\n*   **Scenario 2: The food is given to you as a general gift or charity (sadaqa) by someone who performs Fatiha, but you are not participating in the ritual itself.**\n    *   If the food itself is halal and not offered to other than Allah, and it's given to you as a gift or general sadaqa (charity) that happens to originate from someone who also performs Fatiha, then eating it is generally permissible. In this case, you are accepting food, not participating in the Bid'ah. It's like accepting a gift from a person who may engage in other practices you disagree with but are not directly linked to the gift itself.\n\n**In summary:**\n\n*   The ritualistic \"Fatiha\" is generally considered an **innovation (Bid'ah)** in Islam due to lack of basis in Sunnah.\n*   The food itself, if otherwise halal and not offered to other than Allah, is generally **permissible to eat** *in its essence*.\n*   However, participating in eating the food *within the context of the Fatiha ritual* is generally **discouraged** to avoid condoning or participating in the innovation. If the food is given as a general gift or charity outside the ritual context, it's generally permissible to accept and consume it.\n\nIt's always best for Muslims to adhere to the practices that are clearly established in the Quran and authentic Sunnah of the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) and to avoid innovations in matters of worship. For the deceased, making sincere supplications (dua), giving charity on their behalf, and performing Hajj/Umrah (if applicable) are the legislated ways to benefit them in the afterlife."}

You are dealing with what is known in Islamic jurisprudence as a \"person with continuous impurity\" (Ma'dhoor). This ruling applies to those who have an ongoing, uncontrollable discharge from their private parts (like continuous urination, chronic nosebleeds, or in your case, continuous anal leakage).\n\nHere's how you can approach your taharah (purity) and salaah (prayer) in this situation:\n\n**1. Seek Medical Advice:**\nFirst and foremost, it is highly recommended to consult a doctor. This could be a treatable medical condition (like anal leakage, sphincter issues, or other gastrointestinal problems). Medical intervention might resolve the issue completely, making your taharah much easier.\n\n**2. Understanding the Impurity (Najasah):**\nThe fluid exiting your passage, even if thin and unnoticed, is considered najis (impure) because it originates from the place of stool and carries its stench. Your body and clothes must be clean from it for prayer.\n\n**3. Attaining Taharah (Purity) for Prayer:**\n\n*   **Cleansing (Istinja):**\n    *   Before each prayer time, or before you intend to pray, you must cleanse yourself as thoroughly as possible.\n    *   Wash the area with water until the visible impurity is removed.\n    *   Regarding the stench: If you wash and dry the area, but the stench persists because of the continuous seepage or the nature of the condition, you are excused. You do your best to remove the actual substance and its immediate odor. If the underlying condition causes a constant faint odor despite thorough washing, you have done your part. The goal is to remove the physical impurity, not to eliminate every trace of the condition itself.\n    *   **Drying is Crucial:** After washing, dry the area very well to prevent the fresh fluid from immediately making your inner garments moist again before prayer. Use toilet paper, tissue, or a clean cloth.\n\n*   **Containing the Fluid:**\n    *   After cleansing and drying, it is highly recommended to use some form of barrier or absorbent material to catch the fluid and prevent it from spreading to your clothes.\n    *   This could be toilet paper, a cotton pad, or even an incontinence pad. Place it inside your underwear. This will help keep your clothes clean.\n\n*   **Clothing Purity:**\n    *   Your clothes must be pure for prayer. If your underwear or outer garments become visibly soiled with this fluid, you must change them or wash the soiled part before prayer.\n    *   The absorbent material you use will help protect your clothes.\n\n*   **Wudu (Ablution) for the Excused Person (Ma'dhoor):**\n    *   This is the most important part for prayer. According to the majority of scholars, a person with continuous impurity performs Wudu **once for each prayer time.**\n    *   **When to make Wudu:** You should make your Wudu *after* the prayer time has entered (e.g., after the Dhuhr adhan has been called for Dhuhr prayer).\n    *   **Validity of Wudu:** This Wudu will remain valid *for that specific prayer time only*, even if the fluid continues to exit. It will allow you to pray your obligatory (fard) prayer, any supererogatory (sunnah or nafl) prayers, and even recite Qur'an, perform tawaf, etc., within that prayer time.\n    *   **When Wudu breaks:** This Wudu *will* be broken by anything *else* that normally breaks Wudu (like passing gas, urinating, deep sleep, etc. – provided these are *not* part of your continuous condition and are controllable). Once the next prayer time enters, your previous Wudu becomes invalid, and you will need to perform a new Wudu for the new prayer time.\n    *   **Example:** For Dhuhr, once the Dhuhr time starts, clean yourself, put on your barrier, then make Wudu. You can then pray Dhuhr and any sunnah prayers. Even if the fluid comes out during this time, your Wudu for Dhuhr remains valid. When Asr time enters, you will need to repeat the process: cleanse, barrier, then make a new Wudu for Asr.\n\n**Summary of Practical Steps for Each Prayer Time:**\n\n1.  **Check the time:** Wait until the prayer time for which you intend to pray has entered.\n2.  **Cleanse:** Go to the bathroom and cleanse the area thoroughly with water, removing any visible impurity and its immediate stench as much as possible. Dry yourself well.\n3.  **Barrier:** Place clean toilet paper, a pad, or an incontinence pad in your underwear to catch any fluid.\n4.  **Clothing:** Ensure your clothes are clean from any visible impurity. If not, change them or wash the soiled part.\n5.  **Perform Wudu:** Make your Wudu as normal.\n6.  **Pray:** Proceed to pray your salaah immediately. Your prayer will be valid, even if the fluid continues to exit during the prayer.\n\n**Important Reminders:**\n\n*   Allah does not burden a soul beyond what it can bear. Your situation is challenging, and Islam provides ease for those in difficulty. Your efforts to maintain purity, despite the constant challenge, will be rewarded immensely.\n*   Do your best with sincerity, and Allah will accept it.\n*   Consult with a trusted local scholar if you have further specific questions, as rulings can sometimes vary slightly between schools of thought, although the general principle for the Ma'dhoor (excused person) is widely accepted.\n\nMay Allah grant you ease, healing, and accept your prayers."}

", "Generated_Answer": "Wa Alaikum Assalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh,\n\nThis is a common and excellent question, as the rules of Ihram require careful consideration of anything scented.\n\nThe general principle regarding scents in Ihram is that it is prohibited to **apply perfume (itr), scented oils, or anything strong-smelling with the intention of perfuming oneself or one's clothes.** This includes things like cologne, scented lotions, highly scented soaps, etc.\n\nHowever, the rulings for toothpaste, mint sweets, and food items are generally different:\n\n1.  **Toothpaste (especially mint-flavored):**\n    *   **Permissible.** Most scholars agree that using toothpaste, even mint-flavored, is permissible in Ihram.\n    *   **Reasoning:** Its primary purpose is oral hygiene (cleaning teeth and freshening breath), not to perfume the body or clothes. While it has a scent, it's for internal freshness and the scent dissipates quickly. It's not considered a \"perfume\" in the sense prohibited during Ihram.\n    *   **Recommendation:** If you can find un-scented toothpaste, it would be preferable to err on the side of caution, but regular mint toothpaste is generally fine and does not incur a penalty.\n\n2.  **Mint Sweets / Breath Mints / Any Food which is meant for the use of a fragrant smell (e.g., strong-smelling herbs/spices):**\n    *   **Permissible.** Eating or consuming items like mint sweets, chewing gum (if permitted in general by your school of thought for other reasons), or food items that naturally have a strong smell (like oranges, ginger, garlic, or even certain breath fresheners) is allowed.\n    *   **Reasoning:** These are food items, consumed orally. The prohibition on scent applies to *applying* external perfumes to the body or clothes, not to consuming food that inherently has a smell. The scent comes from the food itself and is consumed, not worn as a perfume.\n    *   **Analogy:** You are allowed to eat an orange, which has a strong citrus smell, or an onion, which has a pungent smell. This is not considered applying perfume.\n\n**Summary and Key Point:**\n\nThe prohibition on scents in Ihram is specifically against the *application* of artificial perfumes and strong fragrances to the body or clothing, with the *intention of beautification or perfuming*. It does not extend to:\n\n*   Hygiene products whose primary purpose is cleaning, even if they have a mild scent (like toothpaste, or un-scented soap if available).\n*   Food items consumed orally, even if they naturally have a strong or pleasant smell.\n\nTherefore, you can use mint toothpaste and consume mint sweets or other fragrant foods while in Ihram without any issue.\n\nMay Allah accept your Hajj/Umrah."}

Hanafi School (and some contemporary scholars):**\n*   **Zakat is generally due on both gold and silver jewelry, regardless of whether it's worn or stored, once it meets the Nisab and has been owned for a year.**\n*   **Reasoning:** They consider gold and silver to be valuable assets (cash equivalents) by nature, and Zakat is due on wealth that reaches the threshold, irrespective of its use as adornment.\n*   **Calculation:** If the jewelry is primarily gold, its value is assessed based on its gold content. If it's primarily silver, its value is assessed based on its silver content. The Zakat rate is 2.5% of the market value of the gold/silver content.\n\n**2. Majority (Jumhur) - Shafi'i, Maliki, and Hanbali Schools:**\n*   **Zakat is generally NOT due on gold and silver jewelry that is worn regularly by women for adornment, provided it is within \"reasonable\" limits and not excessive.**\n*   **Reasoning:** They consider such jewelry to be like personal necessities (similar to clothes or household items) which are exempt from Zakat.

Its fundamental purpose is to alleviate poverty, provide sustenance, and earn rewards from Allah by helping those who are less fortunate. The Quran and Sunnah repeatedly emphasize giving to the poor and needy.\n\n2.  **Donor's Intention (Niyyah):** When a person gives sadaqa, their intention is crucial. In this case, the meat was given specifically to a madrasa for \"orphan Quran students.\" This implies the donor intended for it to benefit these students who are generally considered needy.\n\n3.  **Madrasa's Role as Trustee:** When the madrasa accepts the sadaqa, they become a trustee (ameen) of that donation. They are obligated to use the donation according to the donor's intention and in a manner that aligns with the principles of Islamic charity.\n\n4.  **Using Sadaqa Meat for Mawlid Programs and Rich People:**\n    *   **Diversion from Intended Beneficiaries:** Diverting meat specifically given for \"orphan Quran students\" to a general program, even if it's a religious one like a Mawlid Sharif, is problematic if it means the intended beneficiaries are deprived or if it's then consumed by those who are not in need.\n    *   **Rich People Eating Sadaqa:** While it's not strictly *haram* for a rich person to eat food that originated as sadaqa in all circumstances (e.g., if it's part of a general communal meal where the rich are guests and the poor have also benefited sufficiently), it goes against the *spirit and primary purpose* of sadaqa for rich people to be the main beneficiaries of meat that was specifically intended for the poor and needy. Sadaqa is meant to uplift the poor, not to provide meals for those who can afford their own.\n    *   **Amanah (Trust):** Using the sadaqa meat in a way that doesn't align with the donor's intention or the general principles of sadaqa (i.e., benefiting the needy) can be seen as a breach of trust on the part of the madrasa administration.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nIt is generally **not allowed or appropriate** in Islam for meat given as sadaqa specifically for orphan Quran students to be used in Meelaad Sharif programs and eaten primarily by rich people.\n\n*   The primary beneficiaries (the orphan students) should have received the meat.\n*   The madrasa has a responsibility as a trustee to ensure the sadaqa is used according to its intended purpose and for those who are truly in need.\n*   While celebrating the Mawlid Sharif (which itself is a debated topic among scholars regarding its permissibility and form) can be done, it should be funded through means specifically designated for such events, not by diverting sadaqa meant for the poor.\n\nIf the rich people attending wish to contribute to the Mawlid program, they should do so from their own funds, or the program should be funded by general donations not specifically earmarked for the needy. The sadaqa meant for the orphans and poor students should reach them directly."}

The same thing would apply to sports if done for recreational purposes, for ones health or to bring brothers together over a lawful activity, as long as they are free of anything blameworthy in the Shariah (such as excessive wasting of time that leads to foregoing ones worldly or religious responsibilities, or swearing, players without their awra covered, etc). Unfortunately, there is often much that is blameworthy in recreational sports these days, so one should be careful", "Document": "It was narrated that Humaid bin Abdur-Rahman said:\"I met a man who accompanied the Prophet () as Abu Hurairah (may Allah be pleased with him), accompanied him for four years. He said: The Messenger of Allah () forbade any one of us to comb his hair each day,[1] or to urinate in the place where he performs Ghusl, or for a man to perform Ghusl using the leftover water of a women, or a woman to perform Ghusl using the leftover water of a man - they should scoop it out together.\"[1] It is said this is to prevent him from making his physical appearance his main aim.<D>Al Miswar bin Makhramah said :The Messenger of Allah () came out in the year of al-Hudaibbiyyah with over ten hundreds of Companions and when he came to Dhu al Hulaifah. He garlanded and marked the sacrificial animals, and entered the sacred state of Umrah. He then went on with the tradition. The Prophet moved on and when he came to the mountain, pass by which one descends (to Mecca) to them, his riding-beast knelt down, and the people said twice: Go on, go on, al-Qaswa has become jaded. The Prophet (May peace be upon him) said: She has not become jaded and that is not a characteristic of hers, but He Who restrained the elephant has restrained her. He then said: By Him in Whose hand my soul is, they will not ask any me good thing by which they honor which God has made sacred without my giving them it. He then urged her and she leaped up and he turned aside from them, and stopped at the farthest side of al-Hudaibiyyah at a pool with little water. Meanwhile Budail bin Warqa al-Khuza’I came, and ‘Urwah bin Mas’ud joined him. He began to speak to the Prophet (). Whenever he spoke to the Prophet (), he caught his beard. Al Mughriah bin Shu’bah was standing beside the Prophet ().He had a sword with him, wearing a helmet. He (Al Mughriah) struck his (‘Urwah’s) hand with the lower end of his sheath, and said: Keep away your hand from his beard. ‘Urwah then raised his hand and asked: Who is this? They replied: Al-Mughirah bin Shu’bah. He said: O treacherous one! Did I not use my offices in your treachery? In pre-Islamic days Al-Mughirah bin Shu’bah accompanied some people and murdered them, and took their property. He then came (to the Prophet) and embraced Islam. The Prophet () said: As for Islam we accepted it, but as to the property, as it has been taken by treachery, we have no need of it. He went on with the tradition the Prophet () said: Write down: This is what Muhammad, the Messenger of Allah, has decided. He then narrated the tradition. Suhail then said: And that a man will not come to you from us, even if he follows your religion, without you sending him back to us. When he finished drawing up the document, the Prophet () said to his Companions: Get up and sacrifice and then shave. Thereafter some believing women who were immigrants came. (Allah sent down: O yea who believe, when believing women come to you as emigrants). Allah most high forbade them to send them back, but ordered them to restore the dower. He then returned to Medina. Abu Basir a man from the Quraish (who was a Muslim), came to him. And they sent (two men) to look for him; so he handed him over to the two men. They took him away, and when they reached Dhu Al Hulaifah and alighted to eat some dates which they had, Abu Basir said to one of the men : I swear by Allah so-and-so, that I think this sword of yours is a fine one; the other drew the sword and said : Yes I have tried it. Abu Basir said: Let me look at it. He let him have it and he struck him till he died, whereupon the other fled and came to Medina, and running entered the mosque. The Prophet ( may peace be upon him) said: This man has seen something frightful. He said: I swear by Allah that my Companion has been killed, and im as good as dead. Abu Basir then arrived and said: Allah has fulfilled your covenant. You returned me to them, but Allah saved me from them. The Prophet () said: Woe to his mother, stirrer up of war! Would that he had someone (i.e. some kinsfolk). When he heard that he knew that he would send him back to them, so he went out and came to the seashore. Abu Jandal escaped and joined Abu Basir till a band of them collected.<D>It was narrated from Abu Hurairah that the Messenger of Allah () said:\"On the night in which I was taken on the Night Journey (Al-Isra), I came to people whose stomachs were like houses, in which there were snakes that could be seen from outside their stomachs. I said: Who are these, O Jibra’il?’ He said: They are the ones who consumed usury.\"<D>(He said) Lot said within himself: (Would that I had strength) physical strength and sons to help me (toresist you or had some strong support (among you)!) or that I could rely on a strong clan such that I defend myself from you.<D>(When He made the slumber fall upon you) when He cast sleepiness upon you (as a reassurance) to you (from Him) from Allah against the enemy; and this is a favour from Allah towards you (and sent down water) rain (from the sky upon you, that thereby He might purify you) with rain from physical and minor and major ritual impurities, (and remove from you the fear of Satan) the whispering of Satan, (and make strong your hearts) and preserve your hearts with steadfastness (and firm) by means of the rain ((your) feet thereby) on the sand, i.e. He gathers the sand such that feet become firm on it.<D>(Have they not travelled in the land) have the people of Mecca not travelled for their trade, (and have they hearts wherewith to feel) fear and that which was done to others upon beholding and reflecting (and ears wherewith to hear) the Truth and threats? (For indeed it) seeing without reflection; it is also said that \"it\" here refers to the expression of idolatry (is not the eyes that grow blind) such that it ceases to see physical objects, (but it is the hearts which are within the bosoms, that grow blind) from the Truth and guidance.", "Generated_Answer": "The Hanafi madhab, like other schools of Islamic law, approaches the permissibility of activities based on general Islamic principles derived from the Quran and Sunnah. The default ruling for most things is **permissibility (Mubah)** unless there is specific evidence to prohibit it. Your intention (niyyah) plays a significant role in determining the ultimate religious ruling and the reward (or lack thereof).\n\nLet's break down the rulings for physical activities/sports and reading fictional novels:\n\n---\n\n## 1. Rulings for Physical Activities and Sports (Hanafi Madhab)\n\nGenerally, physical activities and sports are considered **Mubah (permissible)** and can even become **Mustahabb (recommended/rewarding)** if done with good intentions and within Islamic guidelines. They can become **Makruh (disliked)** or even **Haram (forbidden)** if they violate specific Islamic principles.\n\n**Key Principles Governing Permissibility:**\n\n1.  **No Gambling (Qimar):** Any sport or activity that involves gambling (betting money or valuable items on the outcome) is strictly **Haram**. This is a major prohibition in Islam.\n2.  **No Neglect of Obligations:** The activity must not lead to neglecting one's primary religious obligations (like daily prayers - Salah, fasting, seeking permissible livelihood, family duties, etc.). If it distracts from or causes one to miss these, it becomes **Makruh Tahrimi (severely disliked)** or **Haram**.\n3.  **Proper Attire (Awrah):** Participants must maintain Islamic dress code, covering their `Awrah` (parts of the body that must be covered in public and in front of non-mahram individuals). For men, this is generally from the navel to the knee. For women, it is the entire body except the face and hands in front of non-mahram men. In mixed-gender settings, women's full Islamic dress is required.\n4.  **Gender Segregation/Appropriate Interaction:** In competitive or social sports, free and unregulated mixing (`Ikhtilat`) between non-mahram men and women, especially in a manner that leads to temptation (`Fitna`), is generally not permitted. Activities should ideally be segregated or conducted in a manner that maintains modesty and prevents illicit interactions.\n5.  **No Harm to Self or Others:** The activity should not pose excessive danger to oneself or others without a compelling, necessary reason. Deliberately inflicting harm is forbidden.\n6.  **No Wastefulness (Israf/Tabdheer):** While moderate spending on hobbies and sports is fine, excessive spending that is beyond one's means or is deemed wasteful is disliked.\n7.  **Not Leading to Enmity/Quarrels:** While competition is natural, the activity should not routinely devolve into excessive aggression, insults, or severe quarrels that break social bonds.\n8.  **Not Glorifying Falsehood or Disbelief:** The sport or activity should not involve the glorification of symbols of disbelief, polytheism, or practices that are explicitly against Islamic teachings.\n\n**Influence of Intention (Niyyah):**\n\nIndeed, your intention profoundly influences the ruling and your reward.\n\n*   **Permissible (Mubah) & Potentially Recommended (Mustahabb):**\n    *   **Running for Physical Health:** This is highly encouraged. The Prophet (peace be upon him) encouraged physical strength. If your intention is to maintain good health so you can worship Allah better, fulfill your duties to your family, earn a halal living, or simply to take care of the body Allah has entrusted you with, then it's not just permissible but highly commendable and potentially rewarding.\n    *   **Basketball with Friends:** If done for recreation, to maintain physical fitness, to strengthen bonds of brotherhood (among men) or sisterhood (among women), to provide healthy entertainment, and without violating any of the above conditions (no gambling, proper dress, no neglect of prayers, appropriate gender interaction), then it is permissible and can even be rewarding due to the positive social interaction and health benefits.\n    *   Historically, sports like archery, swimming, and horse riding were highly encouraged by the Prophet (peace be upon him) because they served purposes like preparing for jihad and maintaining physical prowess. While the immediate context for these might have changed, the principle of maintaining a strong body for the sake of Allah and His service remains.\n\n*   **Disliked (Makruh) or Forbidden (Haram):**\n    *   **Playing with the intention of showing off (Riya'):** This can diminish or negate the reward.\n    *   **Playing with the intention of harming someone:** This is Haram.\n    *   **Playing so much that you miss prayers or neglect your family/work:** This makes the act Haram due to the neglect of obligations.\n    *   **Playing games that involve excessive violence or are inherently dangerous without a sound religious or worldly benefit (e.g., bullfighting):** These would be Makruh or Haram.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Rulings for Reading Fictional Novels as a Hobby or to Pass Time\n\nIn the Hanafi madhab, reading fictional novels is generally **Mubah (permissible)**, provided certain conditions are met.\n\n**Conditions for Permissibility (and when it becomes problematic):**\n\n1.  **Content of the Novel:** This is the most crucial aspect.\n    *   **Permissible Content:** Novels that offer entertainment, improve vocabulary, stimulate imagination, teach about human nature (within a permissible framework), or provide harmless escapism are fine.\n    *   **Problematic/Forbidden Content:** Reading novels that contain or glorify:\n        *   **Kufr (disbelief) or Shirk (polytheism):** E.g., promoting atheism, worshipping idols, or questioning fundamental Islamic beliefs in a way that leads to doubt.\n        *   **Haram actions:** E.g., explicit descriptions or glorification of adultery, promiscuity, homosexuality, excessive alcohol consumption, drug abuse, severe violence without purpose, or other major sins.\n        *   **Blasphemy or Mockery of Islam:** Any content that insults Allah, the Prophet (peace be upon him), the Quran, or Islamic symbols/practices is strictly forbidden.\n        *   **Excessive or explicit sexual content:** This is generally not permissible as it can lead to impure thoughts and desires (`Fitna`).\n        *   **Distorting Reality:** While fiction is by nature not real, if a novel consistently blurs the lines with reality in a way that can confuse one's religious understanding (e.g., claiming supernatural powers for humans that are beyond natural laws and Islamic belief, unless it's clearly understood as fantasy and doesn't contradict Allah's omnipotence), it might be problematic for some.\n2.  **Neglect of Duties:** Reading should not lead to neglecting your primary religious duties (Salah, Quran recitation, seeking beneficial knowledge), family responsibilities, work, or studies. If it does, the act becomes problematic due to the neglect, not necessarily the reading itself.\n3.  **Excessiveness:** Like any hobby, if it becomes an obsession, leads to addiction, or consumes an inordinate amount of time that could be spent on more beneficial activities (both worldly and religious), it can become Makruh or even lead to Haram if it causes serious neglect.\n4.  **Intention:**\n    *   **Permissible/Mubah:** If your intention is simply to relax, unwind, entertain yourself, or pass time in a wholesome manner without violating any Islamic principles, it is permissible.\n    *   **Potentially Rewarding (Mustahabb):** If reading (even fiction) helps improve your language skills, aids in your understanding of human psychology, or serves as a healthy break that refreshes you for more strenuous religious or worldly duties, it could be seen as having some benefit.\n\n**In summary:**\n\n*   **Physical activities and sports** are permissible and encouraged for health and camaraderie, provided they don't involve gambling, neglect religious duties, expose `Awrah`, or lead to illicit gender mixing. Intention to maintain health or strengthen brotherhood/sisterhood elevates them.\n*   **Reading fictional novels** is permissible as long as the content is wholesome (doesn't promote `Haram` or `Kufr`), and it doesn't lead to neglect of obligations or become an unhealthy obsession.\n\nIt is always advisable to strike a balance in all worldly affairs and prioritize one's religious duties and obligations. When in doubt about a specific activity or content, consulting a qualified Hanafi scholar is recommended."}
{"Question": "Answered by Shaykh Ilyas PatelI have a huge problem concerning brotherhood in Islam. I started practicing in my teen years and day by day MashAllah my deen goes up. I just found out that a brother I know for long time is talking behind my back and he and some other people judge for the way I dress, walk, and talk. They are always trying to bring me down. In fact it seems they hate me deep inside just because the way I am. I feel depressed and it hurts me, brothers judging other brothers outwardly. What should I do? And what does Islam say about backbiting.? --T--", "Answer": "In the Name of Allah, Most Merciful and CompassionateThese brothers who are judging you outwardly is because of their lack of iman and understanding, though they know it is wrong to backbite. They havent come to realise its severity. It is good of you being concerned and wanting them to like you as you are, but this is not the case all the time. You can be judged wrongly even if you are like them. Try to dress in western clothing also and be as normal as you are, in order to show your friends that you are no different when you wear what they are wearing. Also a good way to make them closer is to give gifts. On the other hand, if they are completely off the track and affecting your din then you should try to avoid them and pray to Allah to guide them and keep you steadfast, but keep ties with them by meeting them occasionally or by giving gifts.Ghiba (Backbiting and slander) is a major sin and is a very common ailment in our society. It means to mention anything concerning a person that he would dislike, whether about his body, religion, everyday life, self, disposition, property, son, father, wife, servant, turban, garment, gait Allah clearly mentions in the Quran:Woe to whoever disparages others behind their back or to their face(Koran 104:1)There are other verses and ahadith against backbiting.May Allah save us all from this evil, amin", "Document": "Narrated Aisha:(The wife of the Prophet) Whenever Allahs Apostle intended to go on a journey, he used to draw lots among his wives and would take with him the one on whom the lot had fallen. Once he drew lots when he wanted to carry out a Ghazwa, and the lot came upon me. So I proceeded with Allahs Apostle after Allahs order of veiling (the women) had been revealed and thus I was carried in my howdah (on a camel) and dismounted while still in it. We carried on our journey, and when Allahs Apostle had finished his Ghazwa and returned and we approached Medina, Allahs Apostle ordered to proceed at night. When the army was ordered to resume the homeward journey, I got up and walked on till I left the army (camp) behind. When I had answered the call of nature, I went towards my howdah, but behold ! A necklace of mine made of Jaz Azfar (a kind of black bead) was broken and I looked for it and my search for it detained me. The group of people who used to carry me, came and carried my howdah on to the back of my camel on which I was riding, considering that I was therein. At that time women were light in weight and were not fleshy for they used to eat little (food), so those people did not feel the lightness of the howdah while raising it up, and I was still a young lady. They drove away the camel and proceeded. Then I found my necklace after the army had gone. I came to their camp but found nobody therein so I went to the place where I used to stay, thinking that they would miss me and come back in my search. While I was sitting at my place, I felt sleepy and slept. Safwan bin Al-Muattil As-Sulami Adh- Dhakw-ani was behind the army. He had started in the last part of the night and reached my stationing place in the morning and saw the figure of a sleeping person. He came to me and recognized me on seeing me for he used to see me before veiling. I got up because of his saying: \"Inna Li l-lahi wa inna ilaihi rajiun,\" which he uttered on recognizing me. I covered my face with my garment, and by Allah, he did not say to me a single word except, \"Inna Li l-lahi wa inna ilaihi rajiun,\" till he made his shecamel kneel down whereupon he trod on its forelegs and I mounted it. Then Safwan set out, leading the she-camel that was carrying me, till we met the army while they were resting during the hot midday. Then whoever was meant for destruction, fell in destruction, and the leader of the Ifk (forged statement) was `Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul. After this we arrived at Medina and I became ill for one month while the people were spreading the forged statements of the people of the Ifk, and I was not aware of anything thereof. But what aroused my doubt while I was sick, was that I was no longer receiving from Allahs Apostle the same kindness as I used to receive when I fell sick. Allahs Apostle would enter upon me, say a greeting and add, \"How is that (lady)?\" and then depart. That aroused my suspicion but I was not aware of the propagated evil till I recovered from my ailment. I went out with Um Mistah to answer the call of nature towards Al-Manasi, the place where we used to relieve ourselves, and used not to go out for this purpose except from night to night, and that was before we had lavatories close to our houses. And this habit of ours was similar to the habit of the old Arabs (in the deserts or in the tents) concerning the evacuation of the bowels, for we considered it troublesome and harmful to take lavatories in the houses. So I went out with Um Mistah who was the daughter of Abi Ruhm bin `Abd Manaf, and her mother was daughter of Sakhr bin Amir who was the aunt of Abi Bakr As-Siddiq, and her son was Mistah bin Uthatha. When we had finished our affair, Um Mistah and I came back towards my house. Um Mistah stumbled over her robe whereupon she said, \"Let Mistah be ruined ! \" I said to her, \"What a bad word you have said! Do you abuse a man who has taken part in the Battle of Badr? She said, \"O you there! Didnt you hear what he has said?\" I said, \"And what did he say?\" She then told me the statement of the people of the Ifk (forged statement) which added to my ailment. When I returned home, Allahs Apostle came to me, and after greeting, he said, \"How is that (lady)?\" I said, \"Will you allow me to go to my parents?\" At that time I intended to be sure of the news through them. Allahs Apostle allowed me and I went to my parents and asked my mother, \"O my mother! What are the people talking about?\" My mother said, \"O my daughter! Take it easy, for by Allah, there is no charming lady who is loved by her husband who has other wives as well, but that those wives would find fault with her.\" I said, \"Subhan Allah! Did the people really talk about that?\" That night I kept on weeping the whole night till the morning. My tears never stopped, nor did I sleep, and morning broke while I was still weeping, Allahs Apostle called `Ali bin Abi Talib and Usama bin Zaid when the Divine Inspiration delayed, in order to consult them as to the idea of divorcing his wife. Usama bin Zaid told Allahs Apostle of what he knew about the innocence of his wife and of his affection he kept for her. He said, \"O Allahs Apostle! She is your wife, and we do not know anything about her except good.\" But `Ali bin Abi Talib said, \"O Allahs Apostle! Allah does not impose restrictions on you; and there are plenty of women other than her. If you however, ask (her) slave girl, she will tell you the truth.\" `Aisha added: So Allahs Apostle called for Barira and said, \"O Barira! Did you ever see anything which might have aroused your suspicion? (as regards Aisha). Barira said, \"By Allah Who has sent you with the truth, I have never seen anything regarding Aisha which I would blame her for except that she is a girl of immature age who sometimes sleeps and leaves the dough of her family unprotected so that the domestic goats come and eat it.\" So Allahs Apostle got up (and addressed) the people an asked for somebody who would take revenge on `Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul then. Allahs Apostle, while on the pulpit, said, \"O Muslims! Who will help me against a man who has hurt me by slandering my family? By Allah, I know nothing except good about my family, and people have blamed a man of whom I know nothing except good, and he never used to visit my family except with me,\" Sa`d bin Mu`adh Al-Ansari got up and said, \"O Allahs Apostle! By Allah, I will relieve you from him. If he be from the tribe of (Bani) Al-Aus, then I will chop his head off; and if he be from our brethren, the Khazraj, then you give us your order and we will obey it.\" On that, Sa`d bin Ubada got up, and he was the chief of the Khazraj, and before this incident he had been a pious man but he was incited by his zeal for his tribe. He said to Sa`d (bin Mu`adh), \"By Allah the Eternal, you have told a lie! You shall not kill him and you will never be able to kill him!\" On that, Usaid bin Hudair, the cousin of Sa`d (bin Mu`adh) got up and said to Sa`d bin Ubada, \"You are a liar! By Allah the Eternal, we will surely kill him; and you are a hypocrite defending the hypocrites!\" So the two tribes of Al-Aus and Al-Khazraj got excited till they were on the point of fighting with each other while Allahs Apostle was standing on the pulpit. Allahs Apostle continued quietening them till they became silent whereupon he became silent too. On that day I kept on weeping so much that neither did my tears stop, nor could I sleep. In the morning my parents were with me, and I had wept for two nights and a day without sleeping and with incessant tears till they thought that my liver would burst with weeping. While they were with me and I was weeping, an Ansari woman asked permission to see me. I admitted her and she sat and started weeping with me. While I was in that state, Allahs Apostle came to us, greeted, and sat down,. He had never sat with me since the day what was said, was said. He had stayed a month without receiving any Divine Inspiration concerning my case. Allahs Apostle recited the Tashahhud after he had sat down, and then said, \"Thereafter, O `Aisha! I have been informed such and-such a thing about you; and if you are innocent, Allah will reveal your innocence, and if you have committed a sin, then ask for Allahs forgiveness and repent to Him, for when a slave confesses his sin and then repents to Allah, Allah accepts his repentance.\" When Allahs Apostle had finished his speech, my tears ceased completely so that I no longer felt even a drop thereof. Then I said to my father, \"Reply to Allahs Apostle on my behalf as to what he said.\" He said, \"By Allah, I do not know what to say to Allahs Apostle.\" Then I said to my mother, \"Reply to Allahs Apostle.\" She said, \"I do not know what to say to Allahs Apostle.\" Still a young girl as I was and though I had little knowledge of Quran, I said, \"By Allah, I know that you heard this story (of the Ifk) so much so that it has been planted in your minds and you have believed it. So now, if I tell you that I am innocent, and Allah knows that I am innocent, you will not believe me; and if I confess something, and Allah knows that I am innocent of it, you will believe me. By Allah, I cannot find of you an example except that of Josephs father: \"So (for me) patience is most fitting against that which you assert and it is Allah (Alone) Whose help can be sought. Then I turned away and lay on my bed, and at that time I knew that I was innocent and that Allah would reveal my innocence. But by Allah, I never thought that Allah would sent down about my affair, Divine Inspiration that would be recited (forever), as I considered myself too unworthy to be talked of by Allah with something that was to be recited: but I hoped that Allahs Apostle might have a vision in which Allah would prove my innocence. By Allah, Allahs Apostle had not left his seat and nobody had left the house when the Divine Inspiration came to Allahs Apostle . So there overtook him the same hard condition which used to overtake him (when he was Divinely Inspired) so that the drops of his sweat were running down, like pearls, though it was a (cold) winter day, and that was because of the heaviness of the Statement which was revealed to him. When that state of Allahs Apostle was over, and he was smiling when he was relieved, the first word he said was, \"Aisha, Allah has declared your innocence.\" My mother said to me, \"Get up and go to him.\" I said, \"By Allah, I will not go to him and I will not thank anybody but Allah.\" So Allah revealed: \"Verily! They who spread the Slander are a gang among you. Think it not....\" (24.11-20). When Allah revealed this to confirm my innocence, Abu Bakr As-Siddiq who used to provide for Mistah bin Uthatha because of the latters kinship to him and his poverty, said, \"By Allah, I will never provide for Mistah anything after what he has said about Aisha\". So Allah revealed: (continued...) (continuing... 1): -6.274:... ... \"Let not those among you who are good and are wealthy swear not to give (help) to their kinsmen, those in need, and those who have left their homes for Allahs Cause. Let them Pardon and forgive (i.e. do not punish them). Do you not love that should forgive you? Verily Allah is Oft-forgiving. Most Merciful.\" (24.22) Abu Bakr said, \"Yes, by Allah, I wish that Allah should forgive me.\" So he resumed giving Mistah the aid he used to give him before and said, \"By Allah, I will never withold it from him at all.\" Aisha further said: Allahs Apostle also asked Zainab bint Jahsh about my case. He said, \"O Zainab! What have you seen?\" She replied, \"O Allahs Apostle! I protect my hearing and my sight (by refraining from telling lies). I know nothing but good (about Aisha).\" Of all the wives of Allahs Apostle, it was Zainab who aspired to receive from him the same favor as I used to receive, yet, Allah saved her (from telling lies) because of her piety. But her sister, Hamna, kept on fighting on her behalf so she was destroyed as were those who invented and spread the slander.<D>Narrated Anas bin Malik:That when Haram bin Milhan, his uncle was stabbed on the day of Bir Mauna he sprinkled his blood over his face and his head this way and then said, \"I have succeeded, by the Lord of the Ka`ba.<D>Narrated Aisha:(the wife of the Prophet) \"Whenever Allahs Apostle intended to go on a journey, he would draw lots amongst his wives and would take with him the one upon whom the lot fell. During a Ghazwa of his, he drew lots amongst us and the lot fell upon me, and I proceeded with him after Allah had decreed the use of the veil by women. I was carried in a Howdah (on the camel) and dismounted while still in it. When Allahs Apostle was through with his Ghazwa and returned home, and we approached the city of Medina, Allahs Apostle ordered us to proceed at night. When the order of setting off was given, I walked till I was past the army to answer the call of nature. After finishing I returned (to the camp) to depart (with the others) and suddenly realized that my necklace over my chest was missing. So, I returned to look for it and was delayed because of that. The people who used to carry me on the camel, came to my Howdah and put it on the back of the camel, thinking that I was in it, as, at that time, women were light in weight, and thin and lean, and did not use to eat much. So, those people did not feel the difference in the heaviness of the Howdah while lifting it, and they put it over the camel. At that time I was a young lady. They set the camel moving and proceeded on. I found my necklace after the army had gone, and came to their camp to find nobody. So, I went to the place where I used to stay, thinking that they would discover my absence and come back in my search. While in that state, I felt sleepy and slept. Safwan bin Muattal As-Sulami Adh-Dhakwani was behind the army and reached my abode in the morning. When he saw a sleeping person, he came to me, and he used to see me before veiling. So, I got up when I heard him saying, \"Inna lil-lah-wa inn a ilaihi rajiun (We are for Allah, and we will return to Him).\" He made his camel knell down. He got down from his camel, and put his leg on the front legs of the camel and then I rode and sat over it. Safwan set out walking, leading the camel by the rope till we reached the army who had halted to take rest at midday. Then whoever was meant for destruction, fell into destruction, (some people accused me falsely) and the leader of the false accusers was `Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul. After that we returned to Medina, and I became ill for one month while the people were spreading the forged statements of the false accusers. I was feeling during my ailment as if I were not receiving the usual kindness from the Prophet which I used to receive from him when I got sick. But he would come, greet and say, How is that (girl)? I did not know anything of what was going on till I recovered from my ailment and went out with Um Mistah to the Manasi where we used to answer the call of nature, and we used not to go to answer the call of nature except from night to night and that was before we had lavatories near to our houses. And this habit of ours was similar to the habit of the old Arabs in the open country (or away from houses). So. I and Um Mistah bint Ruhm went out walking. Um Mistah stumbled because of her long dress and on that she said, Let Mistah be ruined. I said, You are saying a bad word. Why are you abusing a man who took part in (the battle of) Badr? She said, O Hanata (you there) didnt you hear what they said? Then she told me the rumors of the false accusers. My sickness was aggravated, and when I returned home, Allahs Apostle came to me, and after greeting he said, How is that (girl)? I requested him to allow me to go to my parents. I wanted then to be sure of the news through them I Allahs Apostle allowed me, and I went to my parents and asked my mother, What are the people talking about? She said, O my daughter! Dont worry much about this matter. By Allah, never is there a charming woman loved by her husband who has other wives, but the women would forge false news about her. I said, Glorified be Allah! Are the people really taking of this matter? That night I kept on weeping and could not sleep till morning. In the morning Allahs Apostle called `Ali bin Abu Talib and Usama bin Zaid when he saw the Divine Inspiration delayed, to consul them about divorcing his wife (i.e. `Aisha). Usama bin Zaid said what he knew of the good reputation of his wives and added, O Allahs Apostle! Keep you wife, for, by Allah, we know nothing about her but good. `Ali bin Abu Talib said, O Allahs Apostle! Allah has no imposed restrictions on you, and there are many women other than she, yet you may ask the woman-servant who will tell you the truth. On that Allahs Apostle called Buraira and said, O Burair. Did you ever see anything which roused your suspicions about her? Buraira said, No, by Allah Who has sent you with the Truth, I have never seen in her anything faulty except that she is a girl of immature age, who sometimes sleeps and leaves the dough for the goats to eat. On that day Allahs Apostle ascended the pulpit and requested that somebody support him in punishing `Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul. Allahs Apostle said, Who will support me to punish that person (`Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul) who has hurt me by slandering the reputation of my family? By Allah, I know nothing about my family but good, and they have accused a person about whom I know nothing except good, and he never entered my house except in my company. Sa`d bin Mu`adh got up and said, O Allahs Apostle! by Allah, I will relieve you from him. If that man is from the tribe of the Aus, then we will chop his head off, and if he is from our brothers, the Khazraj, then order us, and we will fulfill your order. On that Sa`d bin Ubada, the chief of the Khazraj and before this incident, he had been a pious man, got up, motivated by his zeal for his tribe and said, By Allah, you have told a lie; you cannot kill him, and you will never be able to kill him. On that Usaid bin Al-Hadir got up and said (to Sa`d bin Ubada), By Allah! you are a liar. By Allah, we will kill him; and you are a hypocrite, defending the hypocrites. On this the two tribes of Aus and Khazraj got excited and were about to fight each other, while Allahs Apostle was standing on the pulpit. He got down and quieted them till they became silent and he kept quiet. On that day I kept on weeping so much so that neither did my tears stop, nor could I sleep. In the morning my parents were with me and I had wept for two nights and a day, till I thought my liver would burst from weeping. While they were sitting with me and I was weeping, an Ansari woman asked my permission to enter, and I allowed her to come in. She sat down and started weeping with me. While we were in this state, Allahs Apostle came and sat down and he had never sat with me since the day they forged the accusation. No revelation regarding my case came to him for a month. He recited Tashah-hud (i.e. None has the right to be worshipped but Allah and Muhammad is His Apostle) and then said, O `Aisha! I have been informed such-and-such about you; if you are innocent, then Allah will soon reveal your innocence, and if you have committed a sin, then repent to Allah and ask Him to forgive you, for when a person confesses his sin and asks Allah for forgiveness, Allah accepts his repentance. When Allahs Apostle finished his speech my tears ceased completely and there remained not even a single drop of it. I requested my father to reply to Allahs Apostle on my behalf. My father said, By Allah, I do not know what to say to Allahs Apostle. I said to my mother, Talk to Allahs Apostle on my behalf. She said, By Allah, I do not know what to say to Allahs Apostle. I was a young girl and did not have much knowledge of the Quran. I said. I know, by Allah, that you have listened to what people are saying and that has been planted in your minds and you have taken it as a truth. Now, if I told you that I am innocent and Allah knows that I am innocent, you would not believe me and if I confessed to you falsely that I am guilty, and Allah knows that I am innocent you would believe me. By Allah, I dont compare my situation with you except to the situation of Josephs father (i.e. Jacob) who said, So (for me) patience is most fitting against that which you assert and it is Allah (Alone) whose help can be sought. Then I turned to the other side of my bed hoping that Allah would prove my innocence. By Allah I never thought that Allah would reveal Divine Inspiration in my case, as I considered myself too inferior to be talked of in the Holy Quran. I had hoped that Allahs Apostle might have a dream in which Allah would prove my innocence. By Allah, Allahs Apostle had not got up and nobody had left the house before the Divine Inspiration came to Allahs Apostle. So, there overtook him the same state which used to overtake him, (when he used to have, on being inspired divinely). He was sweating so much so that the drops of the sweat were dropping like pearls though it was a (cold) wintry day. When that state of Allahs Apostle was over, he was smiling and the first word he said, `Aisha! Thank Allah, for Allah has declared your innocence. My mother told me to go to Allahs Apostle . I replied, By Allah I will not go to him and will not thank but Allah. So Allah revealed: \"Verily! They who spread the slander are a gang among you . . .\" (24.11) When Allah gave the declaration of my Innocence, Abu Bakr, who used to provide for Mistah bin Uthatha for he was his relative, said, By Allah, I will never provide Mistah with anything because of what he said about Aisha. But Allah later revealed: -- \"And let not those who are good and wealthy among you swear not to help their kinsmen, those in need and those who left their homes in Allahs Cause. Let them forgive and overlook. Do you not wish that Allah should forgive you? Verily! Allah is Oft-forgiving, Most Merciful.\" (24.22) After that Abu Bakr said, Yes ! By Allah! I like that Allah should forgive me, and resumed helping Mistah whom he used to help before. Allahs Apostle also asked Zainab bint Jahsh (i.e. the Prophets wife about me saying, What do you know and what did you see? She replied, O Allahs Apostle! I refrain to claim hearing or seeing what I have not heard or seen. By Allah, I know nothing except goodness about Aisha.\" Aisha further added \"Zainab was competing with me (in her beauty and the Prophets love), yet Allah protected her (from being malicious), for she had piety.\"<D>And from his narration on the authority of Ibn Abbas that he said regarding the interpretation of Allahs saying (Those who disbelieve): (Those who disbelieve) in Muhammad (pbuh) and the Quran (and turn (men) from the way of Allah) and prevent people from the religion and obedience of Allah-the reference here is to those who fed the army of the disbelievers on the Day of Badr: Utbah and Shaybah the sons of Rabiah, Munbih and Nabih the sons of al-Hajjaj, Abul-Buhturi Ibn Hisham and Abu Jahl Ibn Hisham and their host-, (He rendereth their actions vain) He thwarts their good deeds and spending on the Day of Badr.<D>((And it was said unto him): O David!

Your feelings of hurt and depression are completely valid. This situation, unfortunately, is not uncommon, and it takes immense strength and reliance on Allah to navigate it.\n\nLet's address your concerns directly:\n\n### What Islam Says About Backbiting (Gheebah) and Judging Others\n\nIslam unequivocally condemns backbiting (Gheebah), slander (Buhtan), and judging others outwardly. These are considered major sins that can corrode the fabric of the Muslim community.\n\n1.  **Backbiting (Gheebah):**\n    The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) defined backbiting: \"It is to mention about your brother that which he dislikes.\" When asked, \"What if what I say is true?\" He replied, \"If what you say about him is true, then you have backbitten him; but if what you say about him is not true, then you have slandered (Buhtan) him.\" (Reported by Muslim)\n\n    Allah (SWT) states in the Quran:\n    **\"O you who have believed, avoid much [negative] assumption. Indeed, some assumption is sin. And do not spy or backbite one another. Would one of you like to eat the flesh of his brother when dead? You would abhor it. And fear Allah; indeed, Allah is Accepting of repentance and Merciful.\"** (Quran 49:12)\n    This vivid imagery highlights the repulsive nature and severity of backbiting – it's like consuming the dead flesh of your own brother. It damages the individual, the community, and incurs the wrath of Allah.\n\n2.  **Slander (Buhtan):**\n    As mentioned in the Hadith above, slander is even worse than backbiting because it involves fabricating lies about someone, adding the sin of falsehood to the sin of speaking ill of another.\n\n3.  **Judging Others Outwardly:**\n    Their act of judging your way of dressing, walking, and talking, and trying to bring you down, stems from a deeper issue of arrogance and self-righteousness, which Islam strictly forbids.\n    *   **Only Allah (SWT) Judges Hearts:** We are commanded to judge by outward appearances, but only Allah knows what is in the hearts. No human has the right to assume or judge the intentions or internal state of another.\n    *   **Humility:** A true believer is humble and focuses on their own shortcomings rather than seeking out faults in others. The Prophet (PBUH) said, **\"Sufficient evil for a person is that he despises his Muslim brother.\"** (Sahih Muslim) This includes looking down on someone for their appearance or mannerisms, which may simply be differences in personality or local customs.\n    *   **Brotherhood:** Islam emphasizes the unity and love among believers. **\"The believers are but brothers, so make reconciliation between your brothers and fear Allah that you may receive mercy.\"** (Quran 49:10). Such judgmental behavior goes against the very spirit of Islamic brotherhood.\n\n### What You Should Do\n\nGiven this difficult situation, here's what you can do, keeping in mind Islamic teachings and your own well-being:\n\n1.  **Focus on Your Relationship with Allah (SWT):**\n    *   **Don't let them derail your deen:** Your journey in Islam is between you and Allah. Do not let the negative actions of others discourage you from continuing to improve yourself and draw closer to your Creator. Their judgment is ultimately irrelevant to your standing with Allah.\n    *   **Patience (Sabr):** This is a test from Allah. Bearing patience in the face of adversity, especially from fellow Muslims, earns immense reward. Allah loves those who are patient.\n    *   **Du'a (Supplication):** Make du'a for yourself (for strength, guidance, and peace of mind), and also make du'a for them (that Allah guides them to understand the true spirit of Islam and abandon backbiting and judgment).\n\n2.  **Self-Reflection (with Caution):**\n    *   While their actions are wrong, it's always good for a Muslim to reflect: Is there *any* aspect of your character, mannerisms, or outward appearance that might be genuinely un-Islamic or cause legitimate concern *from an Islamic perspective* (not just their personal preferences)? If so, correct it for Allah's sake, not for their approval.\n    *   **Important Note:** Do not let their criticisms make you doubt your sincere efforts in practicing Islam. Your growth is commendable. This self-reflection is about genuine self-improvement, not succumbing to their baseless judgments.\n\n3.  **Confrontation (Wisely):**\n    *   If you feel strong enough and it is safe to do so, you could approach *one* of them whom you might have had a closer relationship with. Do so privately, calmly, and with good manners.\n    *   Say something like, \"Brother, I heard that some brothers have been talking about me and judging my dress/walk/talk. This really hurts me, and it's also something Islam warns us against. As brothers, we should be supporting each other, not bringing each other down.\"\n    *   Remind them gently of the Quranic verse (49:12) about backbiting.\n    *   **Caution:** If you believe confronting them will only escalate the issue, or if they are prone to aggression or further slander, it might be better to avoid direct confrontation for your own peace of mind.\n\n4.  **Limit Interaction and Seek Good Company:**\n    *   If their behavior persists or confrontation is not feasible, the best course of action might be to gradually distance yourself from them. You don't need to make a dramatic exit, but minimize your interactions.\n    *   Actively seek out new company or strengthen your bonds with brothers who are positive, supportive, and truly embody Islamic values of love, respect, and non-judgment. Good company is crucial for spiritual growth.\n\n5.  **Develop a Thick Skin and Rely on Allah:**\n    *   Not everyone will like you, and that's okay. Your worth is not determined by the opinions of others, especially those who violate Islamic ethics.\n    *   Remind yourself that the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) faced far worse treatment. Your ultimate judge is Allah.\n\n6.  **Forgiveness:**\n    *   If you can find it in your heart, forgiving them (not necessarily forgetting, but letting go of the resentment) will free you from the burden of their negativity. Forgiveness is a powerful act that benefits you first and foremost.\n\nBrother T, keep steadfast on your path. Your dedication to your deen is a blessing from Allah. Do not let the misguidance of others dim your light. Continue to learn, grow, and surround yourself with righteous company. Allah sees your sincerity and will reward you for your patience and perseverance.\n\nMay Allah strengthen you, guide these brothers, and grant you peace and contentment.\n\nAnswered by Shaykh Ilyas Patel"}
{"Question": "Q: Is chewing gum halaal or haraam? I have come to know that chewing gum is made up of pig fat. So I want to know from you that what is the Islamic ruling on this? ? --T--", "Answer": "The principle of Shariah is that if the ingredients contained in any food product is from impure or impermissible substance, then consuming such a food product will be impermissible. We are not a Halaal certifying body and do not supervise products of any company or outlet, hence we are not in a position to issue a specific ruling regarding any product. You may refer to any halaal certifying body. And Allah Taala ( ) knows best", "Document": "‘A’ishah said :The Messenger of Allah() liked sweet meats and honey. The narrator then mentioned a part of the tradition mentioned above. The Messenger of Allah () felt it hard on him to find smell from him. In this tradition saudah said: but you ate gum ?

So the first thing that went into the childs stomach, was the saliva of the Prophet.<D>The tradition mentioned above has also been narrated by Al ‘Umm Athiyah from the Prophet () through a different chain of narrators. The tradition narrated by Yazid bin Harun from Hisham does perfectly correspond to the tradition transmitted by Ibrahim bin Tahman and ‘Abd Allah Al Shami from Hisham. The narrator Al Misma’I reported Yazid as saying “I do not know but that he said “she should not dye herself.” To this the narrator Harun added “She should not wear colored clothes except one of the types made of dyed yarn.”<D>(And when ye have divorced women) one or two pronouncements of divorce (and they have reached their term) have completed their waiting period and want to return to their first husbands with a new dowry and marriage contract, (place not difficulties in the way of) do not prevent them (their marrying their husbands if it is agreed between them in kindness) a new dowry and marriage contract.

", "Generated_Answer": "The question of whether chewing gum is halaal or haraam primarily depends on its ingredients. The concern you've raised about chewing gum being made from pig fat is a common one, and it's important to understand the facts regarding modern chewing gum production.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the Islamic ruling and considerations:\n\n1.  **The \"Pig Fat\" Concern (Gum Base):**\n    *   **Historical Context:** In the past, some very old formulations of chewing gum bases might have contained animal-derived ingredients, including tallow (rendered animal fat, which could include pork fat) or other animal by-products.\n    *   **Modern Production:** Today, the vast majority of chewing gum bases are made from **synthetic polymers** (like butyl rubber, polyvinyl acetate, polyethylene, etc.) and waxes, not animal fats. This is done for consistency, stability, and to achieve the desired chew texture. So, the idea that *all* chewing gum contains pig fat in its base is generally incorrect for modern products.\n\n2.  **Potentially Problematic Ingredients (Beyond the Base):**\n    While the gum base itself is usually synthetic, other ingredients can raise concerns:\n\n    *   **Glycerin/Glycerol (E422):** This is a common softening agent in chewing gum. Glycerin can be derived from two main sources:\n        *   **Plant-based:** From vegetable oils (e.g., palm oil, soy oil). This is **halaal**.\n        *   **Animal-based:** From animal fats (including porcine or bovine). If derived from pig fat, it is **haraam**. If derived from other animal fats, it must be from a properly slaughtered (zabiha) animal to be considered halaal.\n        Many manufacturers now use plant-based glycerin due to cost, availability, and to cater to wider markets (vegetarians, vegans, and those seeking halal/kosher products).\n    *   **Gelatin (E441):** While not typically a primary ingredient in the chewable base of standard stick/pellet gum, gelatin is sometimes used in coatings, fillings, or in certain \"chewy candy\" type gums. Gelatin can be derived from pork, beef, or fish. If it's pork gelatin, it's **haraam**. If it's beef gelatin, it must be from a halaal-slaughtered animal. Fish gelatin is generally considered **halaal**.\n    *   **Emulsifiers (various E-numbers):** Some emulsifiers can be animal-derived.\n    *   **Flavorings and Colors:** Rarely problematic, but some specialized flavors or colors might have alcohol or animal derivatives.\n\n3.  **Islamic Ruling & How to Determine Halal Status:**\n\n    *   **Default:** The default ruling for food items is **halaal** unless proven otherwise. However, with processed foods, it's crucial to verify ingredients.\n    *   **Look for Halal Certification:** The most reliable way to ensure a chewing gum is halaal is to look for a reputable **Halal certification mark** on the packaging. This indicates that the product has been inspected and verified by an Islamic authority to comply with Islamic dietary laws. Examples of such certifications include JAKIM (Malaysia), MUI (Indonesia), IFANCA (USA), HMC (UK), etc.\n    *   **Check the Ingredients List:**\n        *   Look specifically for \"gelatin\" and investigate its source if not specified (e.g., \"bovine gelatin\" vs. just \"gelatin\").\n        *   For \"glycerin\" or \"glycerol,\" many companies will specify \"vegetable glycerin\" if it's plant-based. If it just says \"glycerin\" and there's no halal certification, it's ambiguous.\n        *   Look for any other animal-derived ingredients or ambiguous E-numbers.\n    *   **Contact the Manufacturer:** If you are unsure and there is no halal certification, you can contact the manufacturer directly and inquire about the source of their glycerin, gelatin, and other potentially animal-derived ingredients. Many companies provide this information on their websites or upon request.\n    *   **Avoid if in Doubt:** If you cannot ascertain the halal status of the ingredients and there's a strong doubt, it is best to avoid consuming it (principle of *wida' ash-shubuhat*, avoiding doubtful matters).\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nChewing gum is **not inherently haraam**. The potential for it to be haraam arises if it contains ingredients derived from impermissible sources, primarily pork, or non-halal slaughtered animals (for beef/bovine derivatives).\n\nMany major chewing gum brands in Muslim-majority countries, or those widely exported to such regions, either use plant-based ingredients or obtain specific halal certifications for their products. For products without such certification, checking the ingredient list or contacting the manufacturer is the recommended approach."}
{"Question": "I read somewhere that the Beloved Prophet (peace be upon him) used to put oil in his hair, so much so that his clothes/turban would become oily. Was this olive oil that he used? If one rubs olive oil into the hair and scalp for its healthy benefit, is doing wudu over oil-covered hair, and subsequent salat valid? ? --T--", "Answer": "Assalamu alaykum Oil normally soaks very quickly into the hair and becomes absorbed through the scalp. It does not necessarily coat the hair. In dry climates, many people apply oil their hair to protect it from dryness and to gain some coolness. The oil penetrates the hair and scalp and disappears quickly. Therefore, it is permissible to make masah (pass a wetted hand) over oiled hair, unless an excessive amount has been used, in which case one can wait for a short while before making wudu or perform wudu before applying the oil. The Messenger of Allah (upon him be peace) has recommended the use of olive oil, both in cooking and in applying to the body and hair (Shamail Tirmidhi). Shaykh Zakariyya Kandhlawi, in his commentary on this hadith, states that the Messengers (upon him be peace) recommending it means that he possibly used it himself. ", "Document": "Urwa b. Zubair reported on the authority of Aisha, the wife of Allahs Apostle (may peace be upon him), that she said:Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) died (in a state) that it never happened that he could eat to his fill the bread with olive oil twice during a day.<D>It wasnarrated from Ibn ‘Umar that the Prophet () used to put oilonhis head when he was in the state of Ihram, but not oil that wasperfumed.<D>Qatadah narrated from Abu Abdullah that Zaid bin Arqam said:\"The Prophet (S.A.W) would acclaim oil and Wars for (the treatment of) pleurisy.\" Qatadah said: \"And it is put in the mouth on the side which he is suffering. \"<D>Allah then mentioned the honour and blessings that He had bestowed upon the believers, saying: (Allah is the Light of the heavens and the earth) He is the guide of the dwellers of the heaves and earth. Guidance from Allah is of two types: clarification and making things known; it is also said that the verse means: Allah is the embellisher of the heavens by means of the stars and the embellisher of the earth by means of plants and water; it is also said that this means: Allah enlightens the hearts of the believers among the dwellers of the heavens and the earth. (The similitude of His light) the light of the believers; it is also said that this means: the light of Allah in the heart of the believer (is as a niche wherein is a lamp. The lamp is in a glass) made of gems. (The glass is as it were a shining star) one of the following five planets: Mercury, Jupiter, Venus, Mars and Saturn. All these planets are luminous. ((This lamp is) kindled from a blessed tree) from the oil of a blessed tree, (an olive neither of the East nor of the West) in an open space, not touched by the shade of the East nor by the shade of the West; it is also said that this means: in a location which isuntouched by the sun when it rises and when it sets, (whose oil) the oil of the tree (would almost glow forth(of itself)) from behind its rind (though no fire touched it. Light upon light) the lamp emits light and the glass emits light and the oil emits light, (Allah guideth unto His light) Allah honours with knowledge; it isalso said that this means: Allah honours with His religion (whom He will) whoever deserves it; it is also said that the verse means: the likeness of the light of Muhammad in the loins of his forefathers is like this, up to Allahs saying ( kindled from a blessed tree). He says: the light of Muhammad in Abraham was an upright religion (olive tree), and Abraham was neither Jew nor Christian (neither of the East nor of the West), the works of Abraham would almost glow forth in the loins of his forefathers like this (would almost glow forth (of itself)), up until Allahs saying (kindled from a blessed tree) He says: as if it is the light of Muhammad (pbuh) and if Abraham was not a prophet, he would still have this light (though no fire touched it); it is also said that the latter passage means: Had Allah not honoured Abraham, he would not have had this light; it is also said: if Allah had not honoured His believing servant with this light, he would not have had it. (AndAllah speaketh to mankind in allegories) in this way does Allah show to people the trait of knowledge, (for Allah is knower of all things) regarding the honour He bestows upon His servants. Allah struck this similitude of knowledge and clarified its benefit and its praiseworthiness in order that they give thanks to it. Allah says here that just as one uses a lamp to find his way in the dark, so is the light of knowledge used for ones guidance; and just as one uses the stars and planets to find ones way in the darkness of the seas and land, one also uses the light of knowledge for guidance in the darkness of disbelief and idolatry; and just as theoil of a lamp is taken from the blessed olive tree, so too is knowledge from Allah, Exalted is He, for His servant; and just as the olive tree is neither from the East nor from the West, so too is the believer an upright Muslim, neither Jew nor Christian; and just as the oil of the olive tree would almost glow forth of itself even when no fire touches it, so too the faith of the believer is praiseworthy even when there are no virtuous works to accompany it; and just as the niche and the glass and the lamp are light upon light, so too is knowledge light, and the heart of the believer is light and his chest is light and his incoming is light andhis outgoing is light: light upon light; and Allah honours with this light whomever He wills.

This was a common practice for hygiene, grooming, and to keep the hair healthy and shiny, especially in the dry desert climate.\n\n*   **Extent of Use:** The description that his clothes/turban would become oily suggests a regular and sufficient application, indicating good grooming habits, not necessarily excessive or wasteful use. He was known for his cleanliness and pleasant appearance.\n*   **Purpose:** This practice was part of his Sunnah of maintaining cleanliness (tahara), good appearance, and overall well-being. It helped to soften the hair, prevent dryness, and keep it neat.\n\n### Was it Olive Oil?\n\nWhile various types of oils might have been used or were available, **olive oil (Zayt al-Zaytoon)** is indeed highly praised in Islam. The Quran refers to the olive tree as a \"blessed tree\" (Surah An-Nur, 24:35), and there are several narrations about the Prophet (peace be upon him) encouraging its use for food, as an ointment, and for oiling.\n\n*   **Hadith Evidence:** \"Eat olive oil and anoint yourselves with it, for it comes from a blessed tree.\" (Sunan Ibn Majah, Tirmidhi, Darimi)\n*   Given its blessings and widespread availability in the region, it is very likely that olive oil was among the oils the Prophet (peace be upon him) used for his hair and body. Other scented oils or those specifically known for hair care (like sidr, or from specific aromatic plants) might also have been used.\n\n### Wudu Over Oil-Covered Hair and Subsequent Salat\n\nThis is a common and important question for those who practice oiling their hair.\n\n**1. Validity of Wudu:**\n\nYes, generally, **Wudu is valid even if you have olive oil (or other similar oils) in your hair.**\n\n*   **The Principle:** For Wudu to be valid, water must reach the skin/hair surface. Things that form a *barrier* preventing water from reaching the skin (like nail polish, thick paint, or heavy, caked-on substances) would invalidate Wudu.\n*   **Oil's Nature:** Oils, especially natural ones like olive oil, are not considered a barrier in the same way. When you perform *masah* (wiping) over your head during Wudu, you wet your hands and pass them over your hair. The water will still make contact with the hair strands and, to an extent, the scalp. Oils are absorbed and coat the hair rather than forming an impenetrable layer.\n*   **Scholarly Consensus:** The vast majority of scholars agree that the presence of light oil, lotion, or other common grooming products on the hair or skin does not invalidate Wudu, provided that the water actually touches the surface.\n*   **Practical Application:** When doing *masah*, ensure you pass your wet hands firmly over your hair. The goal is to wipe with wet hands, not to soak the hair completely (as is done for Ghusl).\n\n**2. Validity of Salat:**\n\nSince your Wudu would be valid, your **Salat performed after it would also be valid.** There is no separate condition for Salat regarding oiled hair once the Wudu is correctly performed.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   **Moderation:** While oiling the hair is Sunnah and permissible for Wudu, it's generally good to apply it in moderation. Excessive amounts that might truly create a very thick, non-porous layer are rare with natural oils but should be avoided. The Hadith indicates a practical amount that might slightly transfer, not an amount that would make the hair completely impervious to water.\n*   **Cleanliness:** Ensure the oil itself is pure and not mixed with anything impure. Olive oil is naturally pure.\n\nIn conclusion, you can certainly rub olive oil into your hair and scalp for its healthy benefits and follow the Prophet's Sunnah. Your Wudu and subsequent Salat will remain valid as long as you perform the *masah* over your head correctly, allowing the water to make contact with your oiled hair."}

Because of the fear of Allah we have not killed them but yesterday it bit my maasi (working lady). My question is when the government dont act, am I allowed to kill them by poison? They sometimes bark and are always on my door. I fear for my kids. ? --T--", "Answer": "It is permissible. And Allah Taala ( ) knows best", "Document": "It was narrated that  Adiyy bin Abi Hatim Said:\"I asked the Messenger of Allah about hunting with a Mirad. He said: If you strike (the game) with its sharp point, then eat, but if you strike it with its broad side, then the animal has been killed with a blow.,  I asked him about dogs and he said: If you release your dong and he catches (the game ) but does not eat it, then eat, because his catching it is its slaughter, If you find another dog with your dog and your fear that it caught (the game) with him and killed it, then do not eat, for you said the name of Allah over your dog, but you did not say His name over the other one.\"<D>Narrated Abdullah bin Mughaffal:\"I was one of those who held up the branches from the tree away from the face of the Messenger of Allah () while he was delivering the Khutbah saying: If it were not that dogs were a nation among nations, then I would order that they be killed. So kill every one among them that is all black. There is one inhabiting a home in which they keep a dog but their deeds are decreased by one Qirat every day - except for a hunting dog, or a farm dog, or a sheep dog.\"<D>Salim bin Abdullah narrated that his father said:\"I heard the Messenger of Allah raise his voice with the command to kill dogs. All dogs were to be killed except dogs used for hunting or herding livestock.\"<D>(So this day) which is the Day of Judgement (no ransom can be taken from you) O group of hypocrites (nor from those who disbelieved) in Muhammad (pbuh) and the Quran. (Your home is the Fire) your destination is the Fire; (that is your patron) it has better right over you, (and a hapless journeys end) they will come to:their companions being the satans, their neighbours the disbelievers, their food the Zaqqum, their drink boiling water, their clothes pieces of fire and their visitors snakes and scorpions.<D> (Will ye not fight a folk) why is it that you do not fight a people, i.e. the people of Mecca (who broke theirsolemn pledges) which are between them and you, (and purposed to drive out the messenger) and wanted to kill the Messenger when they entered Dar al-Nadwah (and did attack you first) by breaking their pledge when they helped the Banu Bakr, their allies, against the Banu Khuzaah, the allies of the Prophet (pbuh)? (What! Fear ye them?) O believers, do you fear fighting them? (Now Allah hath more right that you should fear Him) because of leaving His command, (if ye are believers).<D>(He it is Who hath caused those of the People of the Scripture who disbelieved) i.e. Banul-Nadir (to go forth from their homes) and fortresses (unto the first exile) because they are the first to be gathered and exiled from Medina to Historic Syria, and specifically to Jericho and Adhriat, as a result of breaking their covenants with the Prophet (pbuh) after the battle of Uhud.

(So learn a lesson, O ye who have eyes!) learn a lesson, O you who have insight in Religion, from what Allah has done to them concerning their exile.", "Generated_Answer": "This is a very difficult and distressing situation, and it's understandable that you are fearful for your children's safety, especially after one of the dogs bit your maasi. Your reluctance to kill them due to \"fear of Allah\" is commendable and reflects Islamic teachings on compassion towards animals.\n\nLet's break down the Islamic perspective on this:\n\n**General Islamic Stance on Animals:**\nIslam generally teaches compassion and kindness towards all living beings. Unjustified harm or killing of animals is prohibited and considered a sin. The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) cursed those who mutilate or torture animals.\n\n**Exceptions: When Killing is Permissible:**\n\nHowever, Islam also prioritizes the protection of human life and safety. If an animal poses a direct, imminent, and unavoidable threat to human life or well-being, or causes significant harm, then taking action to remove that threat, including killing if absolutely necessary, becomes permissible.\n\nIn your case, several factors are important:\n\n1.  **Imminent Danger/Threat:** The fact that a dog has already bitten your maasi is a critical point. This indicates that the dogs are not just a nuisance but a potential danger, especially to young children. Their constant presence at your door and barking also contribute to a threatening environment.\n2.  **Lack of Government Action:** While the first step is always to contact authorities (animal control, municipality), if they are unresponsive and the threat persists, your responsibility to protect your family remains.\n3.  **Neighbor's Intent:** While your neighbors' actions (feeding the dogs to upset you) are problematic and irresponsible, this doesn't change the immediate threat posed by the dogs themselves. The dogs are not at fault for being fed.\n\n**Regarding Killing by Poison:**\n\nWhile the act of killing a dangerous animal may become permissible as a last resort, **killing by poison is generally discouraged and often prohibited in Islam due to its cruelty and indiscriminate nature.**\n\n*   **Cruelty (Muthla):** Poison often leads to a slow, painful death, which is a form of torture (muthla) and is forbidden in Islam. The Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) prohibited the torturing of animals.\n*   **Indiscriminate Risk:** Poison can also pose a risk to other innocent animals, or even children, who might accidentally consume it.\n*   **Other Animals:** If the poison is left out, it could harm other animals that are not a threat to you.\n\n**What You Should Do (Prioritizing Solutions):**\n\nGiven your situation, here's a graded approach based on Islamic principles:\n\n1.  **Exhaust All Non-Lethal Options (Again, More Vigorously):**\n    *   **Intensify Communication with Authorities:** Keep a detailed log of all your calls, emails, and complaints to animal control, local police, and your municipal office. Mention the bite incident explicitly. Ask for official case numbers. Document their lack of action.\n    *   **Seek Help from NGOs/Animal Welfare Organizations:** Many cities have private animal rescue groups or NGOs that might be able to humanely capture and relocate the dogs. They might have more resources or influence than government agencies.\n    *   **Deterrents:** Can you make your property less appealing to the dogs without harming them?\n        *   Ensure no food (even scraps) is ever left outside.\n        *   Use strong smells they dislike (e.g., citrus peels, vinegar, ammonia – though be careful with ammonia around children).\n        *   Motion-activated sprinklers can sometimes deter them.\n        *   Consider installing a stronger, more secure gate or fence if possible.\n    *   **Document Everything:** Take photos/videos of the dogs near your home, their barking, and especially the bite injury. This evidence strengthens your case with authorities.\n    *   **Engage with Neighbors (Cautiously):** While they might be doing this to upset you, perhaps a neutral third party (an elder, a community leader) could mediate and explain the dangers of feeding strays, especially those that bite.\n\n2.  **Last Resort (If All Else Fails and Threat is Imminent):**\n    If, and only if, all the above measures have been exhausted and the dogs continue to pose an immediate and unavoidable threat to your children's safety (especially after a bite incident), then taking action to neutralize the threat becomes permissible.\n\n    *   **Humane Methods:** If killing becomes the absolute last resort, it must be done in the most humane and swift manner possible, causing the least amount of pain and suffering. Poison is not considered humane. This would typically involve professional assistance if available, or a swift, decisive action if you are forced to defend yourself or your children directly.\n\n**In Summary:**\n\n*   **Do not use poison.** It is cruel and dangerous.\n*   **Prioritize the safety of your children.** This is a paramount concern in Islam.\n*   **Exhaust all possible non-lethal solutions first.** Document every step.\n*   If after exhausting all options, the dogs continue to pose an **imminent and severe threat** (especially given the bite history and presence of puppies), then taking action to protect your family would be permissible as a last resort, but it must be done as humanely as possible.\n\nIt's a very challenging situation, and may Allah grant you ease and protection. Continue to pray to Allah for a solution and protection for your family."}
{"Question": "A friend of mine has recently started wearing a scarf, and she came to me today to talk to me a about how she really feels now that she is wearing it. At first she was so strong and liberated, and I was so proud. But now she is staring to question why she actually has to wear it. And not only that, she was even thinking well is it that bad if she decides to take it off. She went away recently with her sister and she was so tempted to go clubbing. Now I dont know how to reassure her. I tried my best. But I find it hard. I dont know how to reassure her. Because when she was strong I felt empowered in a way and strong myself. But now I feel so confused. Its probably really hard to understand what Im trying to say. Im confused. Can you help me? ? --T--", "Answer": "Wa Alaykum Assalam wa Rahmatullah wa Barakatuhu, In the Name of Allah, Most Merciful & CompassionateThe company we keep is critical to our own spiritual development. It would be of benefit to this sister if you would spend time with her and keep her in the company of other righteous sisters.From Shaykh Nuhs excellent article (link to full text below):Say to believing women, that they cast down their eyes and guard their private parts, and reveal not their adornment save such as is outward; and let them drape their headcoverings over their bosoms, and not reveal their adornment . . . (Quran 24:31) This is why Muslim women cover their heads: because the Quran unambiguously orders them to, and there is no qualifying text or hadith or even other lexical possibility to show that the Quranic order might mean anything besides obligation. Rather, the hadiths all bear this meaning out, Muslim scholars are in unanimous agreement about it and have been from the time of the Prophet (Allah bless him and give him peace) down to our own day, and it is even known by all non-Muslim peoples about them . Please see the following links related to your question about wearing hijab: Why Hijab?By Shaykh Nuh Ha Mim KellerThe Islamic Veil or Hijabjannah", "Document": "Narrated Aisha:(The wife of the Prophet) Whenever Allahs Apostle intended to go on a journey, he used to draw lots among his wives and would take with him the one on whom the lot had fallen. Once he drew lots when he wanted to carry out a Ghazwa, and the lot came upon me. So I proceeded with Allahs Apostle after Allahs order of veiling (the women) had been revealed and thus I was carried in my howdah (on a camel) and dismounted while still in it. We carried on our journey, and when Allahs Apostle had finished his Ghazwa and returned and we approached Medina, Allahs Apostle ordered to proceed at night. When the army was ordered to resume the homeward journey, I got up and walked on till I left the army (camp) behind. When I had answered the call of nature, I went towards my howdah, but behold ! A necklace of mine made of Jaz Azfar (a kind of black bead) was broken and I looked for it and my search for it detained me. The group of people who used to carry me, came and carried my howdah on to the back of my camel on which I was riding, considering that I was therein. At that time women were light in weight and were not fleshy for they used to eat little (food), so those people did not feel the lightness of the howdah while raising it up, and I was still a young lady. They drove away the camel and proceeded. Then I found my necklace after the army had gone. I came to their camp but found nobody therein so I went to the place where I used to stay, thinking that they would miss me and come back in my search. While I was sitting at my place, I felt sleepy and slept. Safwan bin Al-Muattil As-Sulami Adh- Dhakw-ani was behind the army. He had started in the last part of the night and reached my stationing place in the morning and saw the figure of a sleeping person. He came to me and recognized me on seeing me for he used to see me before veiling. I got up because of his saying: \"Inna Li l-lahi wa inna ilaihi rajiun,\" which he uttered on recognizing me. I covered my face with my garment, and by Allah, he did not say to me a single word except, \"Inna Li l-lahi wa inna ilaihi rajiun,\" till he made his shecamel kneel down whereupon he trod on its forelegs and I mounted it. Then Safwan set out, leading the she-camel that was carrying me, till we met the army while they were resting during the hot midday. Then whoever was meant for destruction, fell in destruction, and the leader of the Ifk (forged statement) was `Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul. After this we arrived at Medina and I became ill for one month while the people were spreading the forged statements of the people of the Ifk, and I was not aware of anything thereof. But what aroused my doubt while I was sick, was that I was no longer receiving from Allahs Apostle the same kindness as I used to receive when I fell sick. Allahs Apostle would enter upon me, say a greeting and add, \"How is that (lady)?\" and then depart. That aroused my suspicion but I was not aware of the propagated evil till I recovered from my ailment. I went out with Um Mistah to answer the call of nature towards Al-Manasi, the place where we used to relieve ourselves, and used not to go out for this purpose except from night to night, and that was before we had lavatories close to our houses. And this habit of ours was similar to the habit of the old Arabs (in the deserts or in the tents) concerning the evacuation of the bowels, for we considered it troublesome and harmful to take lavatories in the houses. So I went out with Um Mistah who was the daughter of Abi Ruhm bin `Abd Manaf, and her mother was daughter of Sakhr bin Amir who was the aunt of Abi Bakr As-Siddiq, and her son was Mistah bin Uthatha. When we had finished our affair, Um Mistah and I came back towards my house. Um Mistah stumbled over her robe whereupon she said, \"Let Mistah be ruined ! \" I said to her, \"What a bad word you have said! Do you abuse a man who has taken part in the Battle of Badr? She said, \"O you there! Didnt you hear what he has said?\" I said, \"And what did he say?\" She then told me the statement of the people of the Ifk (forged statement) which added to my ailment. When I returned home, Allahs Apostle came to me, and after greeting, he said, \"How is that (lady)?\" I said, \"Will you allow me to go to my parents?\" At that time I intended to be sure of the news through them. Allahs Apostle allowed me and I went to my parents and asked my mother, \"O my mother! What are the people talking about?\" My mother said, \"O my daughter! Take it easy, for by Allah, there is no charming lady who is loved by her husband who has other wives as well, but that those wives would find fault with her.\" I said, \"Subhan Allah! Did the people really talk about that?\" That night I kept on weeping the whole night till the morning. My tears never stopped, nor did I sleep, and morning broke while I was still weeping, Allahs Apostle called `Ali bin Abi Talib and Usama bin Zaid when the Divine Inspiration delayed, in order to consult them as to the idea of divorcing his wife. Usama bin Zaid told Allahs Apostle of what he knew about the innocence of his wife and of his affection he kept for her. He said, \"O Allahs Apostle! She is your wife, and we do not know anything about her except good.\" But `Ali bin Abi Talib said, \"O Allahs Apostle! Allah does not impose restrictions on you; and there are plenty of women other than her. If you however, ask (her) slave girl, she will tell you the truth.\" `Aisha added: So Allahs Apostle called for Barira and said, \"O Barira! Did you ever see anything which might have aroused your suspicion? (as regards Aisha). Barira said, \"By Allah Who has sent you with the truth, I have never seen anything regarding Aisha which I would blame her for except that she is a girl of immature age who sometimes sleeps and leaves the dough of her family unprotected so that the domestic goats come and eat it.\" So Allahs Apostle got up (and addressed) the people an asked for somebody who would take revenge on `Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul then. Allahs Apostle, while on the pulpit, said, \"O Muslims! Who will help me against a man who has hurt me by slandering my family? By Allah, I know nothing except good about my family, and people have blamed a man of whom I know nothing except good, and he never used to visit my family except with me,\" Sa`d bin Mu`adh Al-Ansari got up and said, \"O Allahs Apostle! By Allah, I will relieve you from him. If he be from the tribe of (Bani) Al-Aus, then I will chop his head off; and if he be from our brethren, the Khazraj, then you give us your order and we will obey it.\" On that, Sa`d bin Ubada got up, and he was the chief of the Khazraj, and before this incident he had been a pious man but he was incited by his zeal for his tribe. He said to Sa`d (bin Mu`adh), \"By Allah the Eternal, you have told a lie! You shall not kill him and you will never be able to kill him!\" On that, Usaid bin Hudair, the cousin of Sa`d (bin Mu`adh) got up and said to Sa`d bin Ubada, \"You are a liar! By Allah the Eternal, we will surely kill him; and you are a hypocrite defending the hypocrites!\" So the two tribes of Al-Aus and Al-Khazraj got excited till they were on the point of fighting with each other while Allahs Apostle was standing on the pulpit. Allahs Apostle continued quietening them till they became silent whereupon he became silent too. On that day I kept on weeping so much that neither did my tears stop, nor could I sleep. In the morning my parents were with me, and I had wept for two nights and a day without sleeping and with incessant tears till they thought that my liver would burst with weeping. While they were with me and I was weeping, an Ansari woman asked permission to see me. I admitted her and she sat and started weeping with me. While I was in that state, Allahs Apostle came to us, greeted, and sat down,. He had never sat with me since the day what was said, was said. He had stayed a month without receiving any Divine Inspiration concerning my case. Allahs Apostle recited the Tashahhud after he had sat down, and then said, \"Thereafter, O `Aisha! I have been informed such and-such a thing about you; and if you are innocent, Allah will reveal your innocence, and if you have committed a sin, then ask for Allahs forgiveness and repent to Him, for when a slave confesses his sin and then repents to Allah, Allah accepts his repentance.\" When Allahs Apostle had finished his speech, my tears ceased completely so that I no longer felt even a drop thereof. Then I said to my father, \"Reply to Allahs Apostle on my behalf as to what he said.\" He said, \"By Allah, I do not know what to say to Allahs Apostle.\" Then I said to my mother, \"Reply to Allahs Apostle.\" She said, \"I do not know what to say to Allahs Apostle.\" Still a young girl as I was and though I had little knowledge of Quran, I said, \"By Allah, I know that you heard this story (of the Ifk) so much so that it has been planted in your minds and you have believed it. So now, if I tell you that I am innocent, and Allah knows that I am innocent, you will not believe me; and if I confess something, and Allah knows that I am innocent of it, you will believe me. By Allah, I cannot find of you an example except that of Josephs father: \"So (for me) patience is most fitting against that which you assert and it is Allah (Alone) Whose help can be sought. Then I turned away and lay on my bed, and at that time I knew that I was innocent and that Allah would reveal my innocence. But by Allah, I never thought that Allah would sent down about my affair, Divine Inspiration that would be recited (forever), as I considered myself too unworthy to be talked of by Allah with something that was to be recited: but I hoped that Allahs Apostle might have a vision in which Allah would prove my innocence. By Allah, Allahs Apostle had not left his seat and nobody had left the house when the Divine Inspiration came to Allahs Apostle . So there overtook him the same hard condition which used to overtake him (when he was Divinely Inspired) so that the drops of his sweat were running down, like pearls, though it was a (cold) winter day, and that was because of the heaviness of the Statement which was revealed to him. When that state of Allahs Apostle was over, and he was smiling when he was relieved, the first word he said was, \"Aisha, Allah has declared your innocence.\" My mother said to me, \"Get up and go to him.\" I said, \"By Allah, I will not go to him and I will not thank anybody but Allah.\" So Allah revealed: \"Verily! They who spread the Slander are a gang among you. Think it not....\" (24.11-20). When Allah revealed this to confirm my innocence, Abu Bakr As-Siddiq who used to provide for Mistah bin Uthatha because of the latters kinship to him and his poverty, said, \"By Allah, I will never provide for Mistah anything after what he has said about Aisha\". So Allah revealed: (continued...) (continuing... 1): -6.274:... ... \"Let not those among you who are good and are wealthy swear not to give (help) to their kinsmen, those in need, and those who have left their homes for Allahs Cause. Let them Pardon and forgive (i.e. do not punish them). Do you not love that should forgive you? Verily Allah is Oft-forgiving. Most Merciful.\" (24.22) Abu Bakr said, \"Yes, by Allah, I wish that Allah should forgive me.\" So he resumed giving Mistah the aid he used to give him before and said, \"By Allah, I will never withold it from him at all.\" Aisha further said: Allahs Apostle also asked Zainab bint Jahsh about my case. He said, \"O Zainab! What have you seen?\" She replied, \"O Allahs Apostle! I protect my hearing and my sight (by refraining from telling lies). I know nothing but good (about Aisha).\" Of all the wives of Allahs Apostle, it was Zainab who aspired to receive from him the same favor as I used to receive, yet, Allah saved her (from telling lies) because of her piety. But her sister, Hamna, kept on fighting on her behalf so she was destroyed as were those who invented and spread the slander.<D>Narrated Aisha:(the wife of the Prophet) \"Whenever Allahs Apostle intended to go on a journey, he would draw lots amongst his wives and would take with him the one upon whom the lot fell. During a Ghazwa of his, he drew lots amongst us and the lot fell upon me, and I proceeded with him after Allah had decreed the use of the veil by women. I was carried in a Howdah (on the camel) and dismounted while still in it. When Allahs Apostle was through with his Ghazwa and returned home, and we approached the city of Medina, Allahs Apostle ordered us to proceed at night. When the order of setting off was given, I walked till I was past the army to answer the call of nature. After finishing I returned (to the camp) to depart (with the others) and suddenly realized that my necklace over my chest was missing. So, I returned to look for it and was delayed because of that. The people who used to carry me on the camel, came to my Howdah and put it on the back of the camel, thinking that I was in it, as, at that time, women were light in weight, and thin and lean, and did not use to eat much. So, those people did not feel the difference in the heaviness of the Howdah while lifting it, and they put it over the camel. At that time I was a young lady. They set the camel moving and proceeded on. I found my necklace after the army had gone, and came to their camp to find nobody. So, I went to the place where I used to stay, thinking that they would discover my absence and come back in my search. While in that state, I felt sleepy and slept. Safwan bin Muattal As-Sulami Adh-Dhakwani was behind the army and reached my abode in the morning. When he saw a sleeping person, he came to me, and he used to see me before veiling. So, I got up when I heard him saying, \"Inna lil-lah-wa inn a ilaihi rajiun (We are for Allah, and we will return to Him).\" He made his camel knell down. He got down from his camel, and put his leg on the front legs of the camel and then I rode and sat over it. Safwan set out walking, leading the camel by the rope till we reached the army who had halted to take rest at midday. Then whoever was meant for destruction, fell into destruction, (some people accused me falsely) and the leader of the false accusers was `Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul. After that we returned to Medina, and I became ill for one month while the people were spreading the forged statements of the false accusers. I was feeling during my ailment as if I were not receiving the usual kindness from the Prophet which I used to receive from him when I got sick. But he would come, greet and say, How is that (girl)? I did not know anything of what was going on till I recovered from my ailment and went out with Um Mistah to the Manasi where we used to answer the call of nature, and we used not to go to answer the call of nature except from night to night and that was before we had lavatories near to our houses. And this habit of ours was similar to the habit of the old Arabs in the open country (or away from houses). So. I and Um Mistah bint Ruhm went out walking. Um Mistah stumbled because of her long dress and on that she said, Let Mistah be ruined. I said, You are saying a bad word. Why are you abusing a man who took part in (the battle of) Badr? She said, O Hanata (you there) didnt you hear what they said? Then she told me the rumors of the false accusers. My sickness was aggravated, and when I returned home, Allahs Apostle came to me, and after greeting he said, How is that (girl)? I requested him to allow me to go to my parents. I wanted then to be sure of the news through them I Allahs Apostle allowed me, and I went to my parents and asked my mother, What are the people talking about? She said, O my daughter! Dont worry much about this matter. By Allah, never is there a charming woman loved by her husband who has other wives, but the women would forge false news about her. I said, Glorified be Allah! Are the people really taking of this matter? That night I kept on weeping and could not sleep till morning. In the morning Allahs Apostle called `Ali bin Abu Talib and Usama bin Zaid when he saw the Divine Inspiration delayed, to consul them about divorcing his wife (i.e. `Aisha). Usama bin Zaid said what he knew of the good reputation of his wives and added, O Allahs Apostle! Keep you wife, for, by Allah, we know nothing about her but good. `Ali bin Abu Talib said, O Allahs Apostle! Allah has no imposed restrictions on you, and there are many women other than she, yet you may ask the woman-servant who will tell you the truth. On that Allahs Apostle called Buraira and said, O Burair. Did you ever see anything which roused your suspicions about her? Buraira said, No, by Allah Who has sent you with the Truth, I have never seen in her anything faulty except that she is a girl of immature age, who sometimes sleeps and leaves the dough for the goats to eat. On that day Allahs Apostle ascended the pulpit and requested that somebody support him in punishing `Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul. Allahs Apostle said, Who will support me to punish that person (`Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul) who has hurt me by slandering the reputation of my family? By Allah, I know nothing about my family but good, and they have accused a person about whom I know nothing except good, and he never entered my house except in my company. Sa`d bin Mu`adh got up and said, O Allahs Apostle! by Allah, I will relieve you from him. If that man is from the tribe of the Aus, then we will chop his head off, and if he is from our brothers, the Khazraj, then order us, and we will fulfill your order. On that Sa`d bin Ubada, the chief of the Khazraj and before this incident, he had been a pious man, got up, motivated by his zeal for his tribe and said, By Allah, you have told a lie; you cannot kill him, and you will never be able to kill him. On that Usaid bin Al-Hadir got up and said (to Sa`d bin Ubada), By Allah! you are a liar. By Allah, we will kill him; and you are a hypocrite, defending the hypocrites. On this the two tribes of Aus and Khazraj got excited and were about to fight each other, while Allahs Apostle was standing on the pulpit. He got down and quieted them till they became silent and he kept quiet. On that day I kept on weeping so much so that neither did my tears stop, nor could I sleep. In the morning my parents were with me and I had wept for two nights and a day, till I thought my liver would burst from weeping. While they were sitting with me and I was weeping, an Ansari woman asked my permission to enter, and I allowed her to come in. She sat down and started weeping with me. While we were in this state, Allahs Apostle came and sat down and he had never sat with me since the day they forged the accusation. No revelation regarding my case came to him for a month. He recited Tashah-hud (i.e. None has the right to be worshipped but Allah and Muhammad is His Apostle) and then said, O `Aisha! I have been informed such-and-such about you; if you are innocent, then Allah will soon reveal your innocence, and if you have committed a sin, then repent to Allah and ask Him to forgive you, for when a person confesses his sin and asks Allah for forgiveness, Allah accepts his repentance. When Allahs Apostle finished his speech my tears ceased completely and there remained not even a single drop of it. I requested my father to reply to Allahs Apostle on my behalf. My father said, By Allah, I do not know what to say to Allahs Apostle. I said to my mother, Talk to Allahs Apostle on my behalf. She said, By Allah, I do not know what to say to Allahs Apostle. I was a young girl and did not have much knowledge of the Quran. I said. I know, by Allah, that you have listened to what people are saying and that has been planted in your minds and you have taken it as a truth. Now, if I told you that I am innocent and Allah knows that I am innocent, you would not believe me and if I confessed to you falsely that I am guilty, and Allah knows that I am innocent you would believe me. By Allah, I dont compare my situation with you except to the situation of Josephs father (i.e. Jacob) who said, So (for me) patience is most fitting against that which you assert and it is Allah (Alone) whose help can be sought. Then I turned to the other side of my bed hoping that Allah would prove my innocence. By Allah I never thought that Allah would reveal Divine Inspiration in my case, as I considered myself too inferior to be talked of in the Holy Quran. I had hoped that Allahs Apostle might have a dream in which Allah would prove my innocence. By Allah, Allahs Apostle had not got up and nobody had left the house before the Divine Inspiration came to Allahs Apostle. So, there overtook him the same state which used to overtake him, (when he used to have, on being inspired divinely). He was sweating so much so that the drops of the sweat were dropping like pearls though it was a (cold) wintry day. When that state of Allahs Apostle was over, he was smiling and the first word he said, `Aisha! Thank Allah, for Allah has declared your innocence. My mother told me to go to Allahs Apostle . I replied, By Allah I will not go to him and will not thank but Allah. So Allah revealed: \"Verily! They who spread the slander are a gang among you . . .\" (24.11) When Allah gave the declaration of my Innocence, Abu Bakr, who used to provide for Mistah bin Uthatha for he was his relative, said, By Allah, I will never provide Mistah with anything because of what he said about Aisha. But Allah later revealed: -- \"And let not those who are good and wealthy among you swear not to help their kinsmen, those in need and those who left their homes in Allahs Cause. Let them forgive and overlook. Do you not wish that Allah should forgive you? Verily! Allah is Oft-forgiving, Most Merciful.\" (24.22) After that Abu Bakr said, Yes ! By Allah! I like that Allah should forgive me, and resumed helping Mistah whom he used to help before. Allahs Apostle also asked Zainab bint Jahsh (i.e. the Prophets wife about me saying, What do you know and what did you see? She replied, O Allahs Apostle! I refrain to claim hearing or seeing what I have not heard or seen. By Allah, I know nothing except goodness about Aisha.\" Aisha further added \"Zainab was competing with me (in her beauty and the Prophets love), yet Allah protected her (from being malicious), for she had piety.\"<D>Narrated Aishah:\"What was said about me had been said, and I myself was unaware of it, the Messenger of Allah () got up and addressed the people. He recited the Tashahhud and after praising and expressing gratitude to Allah, as He deserved, he said: To proceed: O people! Give me your opinion regarding those people who made a forged story against my wife. By Allah, I do not know anything bad about her at all. By Allah, they accused her of being with a man about whom I have never known anything bad, and he never entered my house unless I was present there, and whenever I went on a journey, he went with me. Sad bin Muadh [may Allah be pleased with him] got up and said: O Messenger of Allah ()! Allow me to chop their heads off! Then a man from Al-Khazraj, to whom the mother of Hassan bin Thabit was a relative, got up and said (to Sad): You have told a lie! By Allah, if those persons were from Al-Aws, you would not like to chop their heads. It was probable that some evil would take place between Aws and Khazraj in the Masjid while I was unaware of that. In the evening of that day, I went out for some of my needs, and Umm Mistah was accompanying me. On our return, Umm Mistah stumbled and said: Let Mistah be ruined! I said to her, O mother! Why do you abuse your son? On that Umm Mistah became silent for a while, and stumbling again, she said: Let Mistah be ruined! I said to her: O mother! Why do you abuse your son? She stumbled for the third time and said: Let Mistah be ruined! I said to her: O mother! Why do you abuse your son? Upon that she said: By Allah! I do not abuse him except because of you. I asked her: Concerning what of my affairs? So she disclosed the whole story to me. I said: Has this really happened? She replied: Yes, by Allah! I returned to my house, so astonished, that I did not know for what purpose I had gone out. Then I became sick and said to the Messenger of Allah () Send me to my fathers house. So he sent a servant with me, and when I entered the house, I found Umm Ruman downstairs, while Abu Bakr was reciting something upstairs. My mother asked: What has brought you, O daughter? She said: \"I informed her and mentioned the whole story to her, but she did not feel as I did about it. She said: O my daughter! Do not worry much about this matter, for there is never a charming lady loved by her husband who has other wives, but that they feel jealous of her and speak badly of her. But she did not feel the same about it as I did. I asked her: Does my father know about it? She said Yes. I asked: Does the Messenger of Allah () know about it too? She said Yes, the Messenger of Allah () also knows about it. Tears filled my eyes and I wept. Abu Bakr, who was reading upstairs, heard my voice, and came down asking my mother: What is the matter with her? She said: She has heard what has been said about her. On that Abu Bakr wept and said: I beseech you, by Allah, O my daughter, to go back to your home. I went back to my home, and the Messenger of Allah () had come to my house asking my maid-servant about me. The maid-servant said: By Allah! I do not know of any fault or defect in her character except that she sleeps and lets the sheep enter and eat her dough. On that, some of the Prophets Companions spoke harshly to her and said: Tell the truth to the Messenger of Allah (). Finally, they told her of the slander and she said: Subhan Allah! By Allah, I know nothing against her except what a goldsmith knows about a piece of pure gold. Then this news reached the man who was accused, and he said: Subhan Allah! By Allah, I have never uncovered the private parts of any woman. Later, that man was martyred in Allahs Cause. Then the next morning, my parents came to pay me a visit and they stayed with me until the Messenger of Allah () came to me, after he performed the Asr prayer. He came to me and while my parents were sitting around me on my right and my left. The Prophet () said the Tashahhud, praised and glorified Allah and said: Now then, O Aishah! If you have committed a bad deed, or you have wronged (yourself), then repent to Allah, as Allah accepts the repentance from His worshipers. An Ansari woman had come and was sitting near the gate. I said to the Prophet (): Isnt it improper that you speak in such a way in the presence of this lady? The Messenger of Allah () then gave a piece of advice and I turned to my father and requested him to reply to him. My father said: What should I say? Then I turned to my mother and asked her to answer him. She said: What should I say? When my parents did not reply to the Prophet (), I said the Tashahhud, praised and glorified Allah as His due, and I said: Then, by Allah! If I were to tell you that I have not done (this) and Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, is witness that I am telling the truth, that would not be of any use to me on your part, because you (people) have spoken about it and your hearts have absorbed it (as truth); and if I were to tell you that I have done this sin, and Allah knows that I have not done it, then you will say: She has confessed her guilt. By Allah! I do not see a suitable example for me and you except the example of - and I could not remember Yaqbus name - Yusufs father when he said: So patience is most fitting. And it is Allah Whose help can be sought against that which you describe (12:18). She said: \"It was at that time that Revelation came to the Messenger of Allah (), and we remained silent. Then the Revelation was over, and I noticed the signs of happiness on his face while he was wiping (the sweat) from his forehead, and saying: Have the good tidings O Aishah! Allah has revealed your innocence. At that time I was extremely angry. My parents said to me: Get up and go to him. I said: By Allah, I will not do it,and will not thank him nor either of you, but I will thank Allah, Who has revealed my innocence. You have heard (this story) but neither of you have denied it, nor have you changed it (to defend me).\" Aishah used to say: \"But as regards to Zainab bint Jahsh, Allah protected her because of her piety. She did not say anything except good (about me). But her sister, Hamnah was ruined among those who were ruined. Those who used to speak evil about me were Mistah, Hassan bin Thabit, and the hypocrite Abdullah bin Ubayy [bin Salul] and [it is he who] used to spread that news and tempt others to speak of it, and it was he and Hamnah who had the greater share therein. Abu Bakr took an oath that he would never do any favor for Mistah at all. Then Allah, Most High, revealed this Ayah: Let not those among you who are blessed with graces and wealth [until the end of the Ayah] referring to Abu Bakr: to give their kinsmen, the poor, and those who left their homes for Allahs Cause. - meaning Mistah - up to His saying: Do you not love that Allah should forgive you? And Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful (24:22). On that, Abu Bakr said: Yes, by Allah! O our Lord! We wish that You forgive us.

This was revealed about Abdullah Ibn Ubayy Ibn Salul who said to the true believers: Do you really think that you shall conquer Persia and Byzantium?.", "Generated_Answer": "My dear \"T\", it's not hard to understand what you're trying to say at all. In fact, it's incredibly articulate. You've perfectly captured the very human experience of feeling uplifted by someone else's strength, and then feeling lost when that strength seems to waver. Your confusion is absolutely valid, and it speaks to your deep empathy and connection with your friend.\n\nLet's break this down into how you can support your friend, and how you can support yourself through this.\n\n### How to Support Your Friend:\n\nYour friend is going through a very natural and often challenging phase of a significant personal decision. What she's experiencing is not a failure, but a process of deeper self-reflection and re-evaluation.\n\n1.  **Normalize Her Feelings:** The most important thing you can do is to reassure her that what she's feeling is completely normal.\n    *   \"It makes total sense that you're questioning things. When you make a big change, it's natural to explore all sides of it, even the parts that feel uncomfortable.\"\n    *   \"It sounds like you're really grappling with some big feelings and trying to figure out what's truly right for *you*. That takes a lot of courage.\"\n\n2.  **Listen, Don't Advise (Initially):** Your primary role right now is to be a safe space for her to vent and explore.\n    *   **Ask open-ended questions:** Instead of \"Why do you want to take it off?\", try \"What's feeling challenging about wearing it right now?\" or \"What's changed for you since you first started wearing it?\" or \"What parts of yourself are you feeling are being restricted, if any?\"\n    *   **Focus on *her* feelings:** \"It sounds like you're feeling a conflict between X and Y. Is that right?\"\n    *   **Validate her emotions:** \"It sounds like you're feeling torn/confused/tempted, and that's completely understandable.\"\n\n3.  **Remind Her of Her \"Why\" (Gently):** When she's ready, and only if she brings it up, you can gently prompt her to revisit her original motivations, not to pressure her, but to help *her* reconnect with them.\n    *   \"I remember when you first started wearing it, you talked about feeling so strong and liberated. What was that feeling about for you then?\"\n    *   \"What were the core reasons you decided to take this step?\"\n    *   **Crucially:** Follow this with \"And how do those reasons feel to you now?\" or \"Do those reasons still resonate in the same way?\"\n\n4.  **Emphasize Her Autonomy:** Make it clear that this is *her* journey and *her* decision, and your friendship isn't conditional on her choices about the scarf.\n    *   \"Ultimately, this is a decision that only you can make for yourself. What feels true and authentic for *you* right now?\"\n    *   \"Whatever you decide, know that I'll always support you. My friendship isn't about what you wear, but who you are.\"\n    *   Regarding the clubbing: \"It sounds like you're craving a certain kind of freedom or experience. How do you see the scarf fitting, or not fitting, into that desire?\"\n\n5.  **Help Her Explore the Consequences (Without Judgment):** If she's thinking about taking it off, help her think through *her* potential feelings or the reactions she might face, so she's prepared.\n    *   \"If you were to take it off, how do you imagine you'd feel? What would that mean for you?\"\n    *   \"Are you thinking about how others might react? And how does that make you feel?\"\n    *   \"What does 'taking it off' represent for you? Is it freedom, or something else?\"\n\n### How to Reassure Yourself:\n\nThis is where your own confusion comes in, and it's important to acknowledge and address it.\n\n1.  **Separate Her Journey from Yours:** Your empowerment initially came from witnessing her strength. That's a beautiful thing, but true, sustainable empowerment comes from within *you*.\n    *   **Acknowledge the feeling:** \"It's natural to feel a bit deflated or confused when someone you admire starts questioning something you celebrated in them. You felt strong *with* her, and now you feel confused *with* her.\"\n    *   **Refocus on your own strength:** Your strength doesn't depend on her choices. You are strong because of *who you are*, your values, your resilience, your own journey.\n    *   **Reframe:** Her questioning isn't a sign of weakness in her, or in you. It's a sign of her *growth* and deeper self-inquiry, which can be messy and confusing. And your own confusion is a sign of your deep capacity for empathy.\n\n2.  **Understand the Nature of Identity:** Identity is not static. It evolves. What felt right and liberating yesterday might feel restrictive today, or vice-versa. This is true for everyone, whether it's about clothing, career, relationships, or beliefs.\n    *   Her journey with the scarf is about *her evolving identity*. It's a very personal and internal process, and it's healthy for her to explore it fully.\n\n3.  **Practice Self-Compassion:** Be kind to yourself for feeling confused. You're navigating a complex situation as a supportive friend. It's okay to not have all the answers, for her or for yourself.\n    *   Remind yourself that your role is to be a loving friend, not a guide or a guru.\n\nWhat your friend is going through is deeply personal. It might be tied to faith, cultural identity, personal growth, or a combination of all three. Your best approach is to offer unconditional love and a listening ear, giving her the space to arrive at *her own* truth, whatever that may be. And in doing so, you'll find your own strength in your capacity for support, empathy, and acceptance."}

He says: and of that which you cast inthe fire of gold and silver contains adulteration just as the foam of the sea does have salt (in order to make ornaments) which you were. Allah says here: the Truth is like gold and silver which benefit people, and falsehood is like the impurities which are derived from the casting of gold and silver, which are of no benefit. Likewise falsehood benefits no one (and tools) ore and copper (riseth a foam like unto it) He says: these also have impurities, i.e. just as the foam of the sea. This is another simile. He says: the Truth is like ore and copper from which people benefit, just as people benefit from the Truth. And falsehood is like the impurities resulting from the casting of ore and copper, which are of no benefit, just as falsehood is of no benefit to anyone, (thus Allah coineth (the similitude of)) thus Allah explains (the true and the false. Then, as for the foam, it passeth away as scum upon the banks) it goes just as it comes: it is of no benefit to itsowner, (while, as for that which is of use to mankind) pure water, gold, silver, ore and copper, (it remaineth in the earth) it is useful just as the Truth is.

This involves:\n        *   **Regret:** Feeling genuine remorse for the action.\n        *   **Cessation:** Stopping the action immediately (which you've done by realizing it was wrong).\n        *   **Resolution:** Firmly intending never to repeat such an action again.\n        *   **Rectification (if possible):** This is where your current question comes in.\n\n2.  **Regarding Retrieving the Game:**\n    *   **The Ideal:** Ideally, you would retrieve the haraam item and destroy it, as this would be the most complete form of rectification for your past action.\n    *   **Practicality and Undue Hardship:** However, Islam does not burden a soul beyond its capacity. Given that:\n        *   The borrower is in \"another city,\" implying significant effort, time, and potential expense to retrieve it.\n        *   It has been \"three years,\" meaning the item is now fully in the possession and use of the non-Muslim borrower, and the direct link of your \"lending\" is quite distant.\n        *   The borrower is a \"non-Muslim,\" and while you are responsible for your own actions (lending the haraam item), you are not directly responsible for how a non-Muslim utilizes their own property or items in their possession, especially after such a long time and distance. They are not bound by Islamic rulings regarding haraam.\n\n    *   **Conclusion on Retrieval:** If retrieving the game would cause you undue hardship (e.g., significant travel, expense, conflict, or simply being impractical), you are **not obligated** to make an extraordinary effort to retrieve it. Your primary sin was in the *act of lending* it in the first place, not necessarily in being perpetually responsible for its existence in someone else's possession, especially after it has been with them for so long and they are far away.\n\n3.  **Alternative Ways (and what is most important):**\n    *   **Focus on Your Repentance:** The most important \"way around this\" for *you* is to strengthen your sincere repentance. Make du'a to Allah for forgiveness.\n    *   **Avoid Future Haram Dealings:** Ensure you never lend, sell, or facilitate anything haraam again.\n    *   **Increase Good Deeds:** Perform more good deeds, give charity, and engage in acts of worship, as good deeds erase bad ones.\n    *   **Consider a Gentle Communication (Optional and Delicate):** If you have a very good relationship with this person and you believe they would understand without taking offense, you *could* gently explain that due to your religious beliefs, you regret lending the game and would appreciate it if they could discard it. However, this is *highly optional* and depends entirely on your relationship and their understanding. If it might cause confusion, dawah issues, or strain the relationship, it's better not to, as the primary responsibility is on *your* repentance and actions, not on trying to enforce Islamic rulings on a non-Muslim in their private affairs three years later.\n\nIn summary, prioritize your sincere repentance for the initial act of lending. While retrieving and destroying the game would be ideal if easy, if it causes undue hardship due to distance and time, you are not obligated to go to extreme lengths. Focus on your relationship with Allah and your commitment to avoiding such mistakes in the future."}

This can be frustrating and impact your sense of cleanliness.\n\nLet's break down the possible reasons and what you can do:\n\n**Understanding the Problem:**\n\n1.  **Incomplete Evacuation:** When not all stool comes out, some might remain in the rectum or anal canal, leading to the feeling of needing to go again, or residual leakage. Mild constipation often contributes to this, as harder or more compact stool can be difficult to pass completely.\n2.  **Stool Consistency:** If your stool is soft, sticky, or fragmented (due to constipation or other factors), it can be harder to clean off completely.\n3.  **Anal Sphincter Function:** Sometimes, the anal muscles (sphincters) might not fully close after a bowel movement, allowing small amounts of residual stool or moisture to escape. Hemorrhoids or skin tags can also make cleaning difficult.\n\n**Why Your Current Method Isn't Working:**\n\n*   **\"Walking around for a bit so the toilet stays inside\":** This is unlikely to help and might even worsen things. Once stool reaches the rectum and you feel the urge, it needs to be evacuated. Trying to hold it in or waiting will not make it \"retract\" or be absorbed. In fact, holding stool can lead to it becoming harder and more difficult to pass later, exacerbating constipation. The sensation you're having is likely due to stool that *hasn't* come out, not stool that is \"inside\" and might \"stay.\"\n\n**What You Should Do:**\n\nHere's a comprehensive approach focusing on both bowel habits and hygiene:\n\n**A. Addressing Incomplete Evacuation & Stool Consistency (The Root Cause):**\n\n1.  **Increase Fiber Intake Gradually:**\n    *   **Soluble Fiber:** Found in oats, beans, lentils, apples, pears, and psyllium husk (e.g., Metamucil). This softens stool.\n    *   **Insoluble Fiber:** Found in whole grains, vegetables, and fruit skins. This adds bulk and helps move things along.\n    *   **Goal:** Aim for 25-35 grams of fiber per day. Increase slowly over weeks to avoid bloating and gas.\n2.  **Drink Plenty of Water:** Fiber needs water to work effectively. Aim for 8-10 glasses (2-2.5 liters) of plain water daily. Dehydration makes stool hard and difficult to pass.\n3.  **Regular Exercise:** Physical activity stimulates bowel movements. Even a daily walk can help.\n4.  **Optimal Bowel Position:**\n    *   Use a footstool (like a \"Squatty Potty\") to elevate your knees above your hips while on the toilet. This straightens the rectum, making it easier for stool to pass completely without straining.\n5.  **Don't Ignore the Urge:** Go to the bathroom when you feel the urge. Holding it in allows more water to be absorbed from the stool, making it harder.\n6.  **Allow Enough Time, But Don't Strain:** Sit on the toilet for 5-10 minutes, but don't force or strain excessively. Straining can contribute to hemorrhoids and anal fissures.\n7.  **Consider Probiotics:** Some people find probiotics helpful for overall gut health and bowel regularity.\n\n**B. Optimizing Post-Bowel Movement Hygiene:**\n\n1.  **Wipe Gently, Front to Back:**\n    *   Use soft, unscented toilet paper.\n    *   Wipe from front to back (especially important for women to prevent UTIs).\n    *   Use a dabbing motion rather than scrubbing, which can irritate the skin.\n2.  **Consider a Bidet or Peri Bottle:**\n    *   **Bidet:** This is the most effective way to clean the area. A bidet or a bidet attachment for your toilet will use a stream of water to thoroughly clean. This can significantly reduce or eliminate residual staining.\n    *   **Peri Bottle:** A small squeeze bottle (often used postpartum) filled with warm water can also be used to rinse the area effectively after wiping with toilet paper.\n3.  **Wet Wipes (Use with Caution):**\n    *   **If you must use them:** Choose unscented, alcohol-free \"flushable\" wipes. However, be aware that many \"flushable\" wipes are *not* truly flushable and can clog plumbing. It's often safer to dispose of them in a trash can.\n    *   **Avoid over-reliance:** While they clean well, overuse can sometimes irritate the skin or disrupt its natural balance.\n4.  **Shower After (If Practical):** If you're home and have time, a quick shower after a bowel movement ensures thorough cleaning.\n5.  **Ensure Complete Drying:** After washing or wiping with wet products, gently pat the area completely dry with clean toilet paper or a soft towel. Moisture can lead to skin irritation, itching, and make the area feel unclean.\n\n**When to See a Doctor:**\n\nIf after implementing these changes for a few weeks, you still experience:\n\n*   Persistent incomplete evacuation\n*   Significant anal itching or irritation\n*   Pain during or after bowel movements\n*   Blood in your stool (bright red or dark)\n*   Any significant change in bowel habits\n*   Unexplained weight loss\n\nIt's important to consult a doctor. They can rule out any underlying medical conditions (like hemorrhoids, anal fissures, irritable bowel syndrome, or other less common issues) that might be contributing to your symptoms.\n\nBy focusing on improving your bowel habits to achieve a complete evacuation and then using effective hygiene methods, you should be able to resolve this issue and feel much cleaner and more comfortable."}

It takes immense strength to acknowledge such a struggle, and the fact that you are seeking Allah's help shows a strong spark of faith within you. Do not despair, for Allah's mercy encompasses all things, and He is the Most Forgiving, the Most Merciful.\n\nLet's address your concerns systematically, with the help of Allah.\n\n***\n\n## Part 1: How to Stop the Addiction to Pornography\n\nThis is a spiritual, mental, and often physical struggle that requires consistent effort and reliance on Allah.\n\n**1. Sincere Repentance (Tawbah Nasaaha) to Allah:**\n*   **Immediate Action:** Turn to Allah right now. Make a sincere intention to stop this sin. Ask for His forgiveness and His strength. Believe that He *will* forgive you if your repentance is sincere.\n*   **The Power of Du'a:** Constantly make supplications, especially during your prostrations (sujood), asking Allah to purify your gaze, your heart, and to remove this addiction from your life. Ask for a pure and blessed marriage.\n*   **Recognize Allah's Presence:** Remember that Allah sees everything you do, even in secret. Let this awareness be a deterrent.\n\n**2. Practical Steps to Break the Cycle:**\n*   **Remove All Triggers:**\n    *   **Digital Cleanse:** Delete all pornography from your devices (phone, computer, hard drives). Unfollow any accounts that promote or lead to such content.\n    *   **Blocking Software:** Install strong content filters and ad blockers on all your devices. Consider accountability software that sends reports to a trusted, non-judgmental friend or family member (someone you can confide in if you choose, but not necessarily about the details of the addiction itself, rather the need for digital accountability).\n    *   **Environmental Change:** Avoid being alone in situations that tempt you (e.g., late at night with your phone/laptop in bed). Move your computer to a common area if possible.\n*   **Identify Your Triggers:**\n    *   What emotions lead you to it? (Stress, boredom, loneliness, sadness, anger?)\n    *   What times of day or specific situations make you vulnerable?\n    *   Once you know your triggers, you can plan alternatives.\n*   **Replace the Habit:**\n    *   **Spiritual Replacements:** When the urge strikes, immediately turn to:\n        *   **Salah:** Pray two rak'ahs of Tawbah (repentance).\n        *   **Quran:** Read a few verses, listen to recitation.\n        *   **Dhikr:** Recite \"La ilaha illallah,\" \"Subhanallah,\" \"Astaghfirullah.\" Engage in abundant remembrance of Allah.\n        *   **Du'a:** Make specific du'as for purity and strength.\n        *   **Islamic Knowledge:** Listen to lectures, read Islamic books.\n    *   **Healthy Alternatives:**\n        *   **Physical Activity:** Go for a walk, exercise, play sports. This releases endorphins and reduces stress.\n        *   **Hobbies:** Engage in productive hobbies (reading, learning a new skill, writing, cooking).\n        *   **Socialize (Halal):** Spend time with good company – friends, family, people who remind you of Allah. Do not isolate yourself.\n        *   **Help Others:** Volunteer, serve your community. This shifts focus from self to others.\n*   **Lower Your Gaze (Gadd al-Basar):** This is a command from Allah. Consciously strive to lower your gaze from anything unlawful outside of pornography as well, as this trains your eyes and heart.\n*   **Understand the Harm:** Remind yourself constantly of the negative effects:\n    *   **Spiritual:** Distance from Allah, hardening of the heart, loss of barakah.\n    *   **Mental:** Distortion of reality, unrealistic expectations, anxiety, guilt, depression.\n    *   **Relational:** Damages ability to form healthy relationships, creates distrust, can lead to marital issues.\n    *   **Physical:** Can lead to other sins and unhealthy behaviors.\n*   **Seek Support:**\n    *   **Professional Help:** If the addiction feels overwhelming, consider seeing a therapist or counselor specializing in addiction. This is not a sign of weakness, but a sign of strength and commitment to recovery. Many specialize in faith-based counseling too.\n    *   **Trusted Mentor:** If you have a trusted, knowledgeable Imam or a very wise and discreet elder, you might consider confiding in them for general guidance on overcoming sins, without necessarily detailing the specific sin if you're uncomfortable.\n\n**3. Patience and Persistence:**\n*   **Don't Despair:** Slips may happen. If you fall, don't let Shaytan make you despair. Immediately repent again and get back on track. The key is how quickly you return to Allah after a slip.\n*   **Focus on Progress, Not Perfection:** Celebrate small victories. Each day you abstain is a step closer to Allah.\n*   **Strengthen Your Iman:** The stronger your faith, the easier it will be to resist temptation. Regularly attend mosque, listen to Quran, learn about Islam.\n\n***\n\n## Part 2: Should You Tell Your Fiancée?\n\nThis is a sensitive matter, and Islamic guidance generally leans towards **not disclosing past sins** that were committed solely against Allah and yourself, and for which you have sincerely repented.\n\nHere's why:\n\n*   **The Principle of Sitr (Concealment):** Allah loves to conceal the sins of His servants. The Prophet (PBUH) said, \"Whoever conceals a Muslim's fault, Allah will conceal his fault in this world and in the Hereafter.\" (Muslim). This applies to sins committed against Allah's rights.\n    *   Confessing your past sin to your fiancée, while seemingly an act of honesty, can actually cause more harm than good.\n    *   It can erode trust, plant seeds of doubt, cause her unnecessary pain, and create future resentment or suspicion, even if you have truly repented.\n    *   It does not benefit her, nor does it remove a right that was owed to her (unless you were engaging in this during your engagement or after marriage, which is a different matter requiring immediate cessation).\n*   **Sincere Repentance is to Allah:** When you commit a sin against Allah, your repentance is to Him alone. He is the One who forgives.\n*   **Your Responsibility Now:** Your responsibility is to ensure that you are purified from this habit *before* marriage and to be the best, most faithful, and God-fearing husband to her *after* marriage.\n*   **Deception vs. Concealment:** It is not deception if you are truly repenting and committed to never returning to it. Deception would be if you were actively still engaged in it, intended to continue, or if it was a right of hers that you violated. This sin, while grave, is against Allah and your own soul.\n\n**Therefore, the strong recommendation is: DO NOT tell your fiancée about your past struggle with pornography.**\n\n**What you MUST do instead:**\n\n1.  **Make Sincere Tawbah to Allah:** This is paramount. Address your guilt directly with Allah.\n2.  **Ensure Complete Cessation:** Work diligently to stop this addiction *before* your marriage. Do not enter into the marriage while still struggling with it in an active way. You owe it to yourself, to her, and to Allah to begin this sacred union on a pure foundation. If you marry while still actively addicted, that would be a form of deception and incredibly unfair to her.\n3.  **Focus on Being the Best Husband:** Channel your efforts into being a righteous, kind, loving, and faithful husband to her. Fulfill her rights and your duties to her in the best possible way. Let your future actions speak louder than any past confession.\n4.  **Trust in Allah's Sitr:** Trust that Allah has covered your sin for you. Live a life of gratitude for His mercy and strive to never commit such a sin again.\n\n***\n\n**In Summary:**\n\n*   **For stopping pornography:** Engage in sincere Tawbah, implement practical steps to remove triggers and replace habits, strengthen your faith, and seek professional help if needed.\n*   **For telling your fiancée:** Do not tell her about your past addiction. Focus on purifying yourself completely before marriage and being the best husband possible. Your repentance is between you and Allah.\n\nMay Allah Ta'ala ease your struggles, accept your sincere repentance, and grant you a blessed, pure, and righteous marriage. May He make you a source of coolness for your fiancée's eyes and guide you both to Jannah. Ameen."}
{"Question": "I have been asked by someone who is considering to convert to Islam whether or not it is permissible for men to to wear earrings according to the classical fiqh? I told him that I was unaware of a complete consensus on this issue, although it was agreed that for men to imitate women and to wear gold was forbidden. (he was wearing wooden cuffs on the ears). I expressed uncertainty on this as I recalled ( I think, long time ago) seeing Arabian and African Muslim tribesmen wearing earrings, although I do not think they were wearing golden ones. ? --T--", "Answer": " It is impermissible for men to wear earrings or have their ears pierced in order to wear earrings. There are certain reasons for this prohibition: Firstly, it is agreed upon by the scholars, that it is unlawful for men to adorn themselves with any type of jewellery besides a silver ring. (See: Ibn Qudama, al-Mughni, 2.324 & al-Mawsua al-Fiqhiyya). The great Hanafi Jurist, Imam al-Haskafi (may Allah have mercy on him) states in his famous work, Durr al-Mukhtar: It is not permissible for a man to adorn himself with any type of gold and silver whatsoever (mutlaqan) besides a silver ring(Radd al-Muhtar ala al-Durr al-Mukhtar, 6/358-359, fasl fi al-libas). Secondly, earrings are (still) generally considered a type of adornment for women and even in the West they were originally worn by those men who wanted to imitate women. Imitating women intentionally is considered unlawful in Islam. Sayyiduna Abd Allah ibn Abbas (Allah be pleased with him) relates, that the Messenger of Allah (Allah bless him & give him peace): Cursed those men who imitate women and those women who imitate men (Sahih al-Bukhari, 7/205). Thirdly, wearing earrings is a custom that developed and is generally prevalent among non-Muslim men, and imitating non-Muslims is also impermissible. Sayyiduna Abd Allah ibn Umar (Allah be pleased with him) narrates that the Messenger of Allah (Allah bless him & give him peace) said: Whoever imitates a people is one of them. (Sunan Abu Dawud, no. 4031 & Musnad Ahmad, 2/50) Given the above reasons, it would not be permissible for men to wear and adorn themselves with earrings", "Document": "Narrated Umm Salamah, Ummul Muminin:When the verse \"That they should cast their outer garments over their persons\" was revealed, the women of Ansar came out as if they had crows over their heads by wearing outer garments.<D>Narrated Umm Salamah, Ummul Muminin:When the verse \"That they should cast their outer garments over their persons\" was revealed, the women of Ansar came out as if they had crows over their heads by wearing outer garments.<D>Narrated Imran ibn Husayn:The Prophet () said: I do not ride on purple, or wear a garment dyed with saffron, or wear shirt hemmed with silk. Pointing to the collar of his shirt al-Hasan (al-Basri) said: The perfume used by men should have an odour but no colour, and the perfume used by women should have a colour but no odour. Said said: I think he said: They interpreted his tradition about perfume used by women as applying when she comes out. But when she is with her husband, she may use any perfume she wishes.<D>((Pharaoh) said unto those around him) of attendants: (Hear ye not) what Moses says? There were around Pharaoh at that time 250 men wearing attires made of silk brocade plaited with gold. These men were Pharaohs closest courtiers, and they asked Moses: who is this Lord of the heavens and the earth to whom you are calling us? <D>Allah then showed their abode, saying: (Gardens of Eden!) the chamber of the Beneficent is their dwelling, with the Gardens surrounding it. (They enter them wearing armlets of gold and pearl) this is the attire of women while the attire of men will be made of gold (and their raiment therein) in Paradise (is silk).<D>(Nay) it is sufficient to you, (but if you persevere) in war with your Prophet, (and keep from evil) and keep from contravening and disobeying Him, (and) the people of Mecca (attack you suddenly) from the direction of Mecca, (your Lord will help you) against your enemy (with five thousand angels sweeping on) 5,000 marked angels; it is also said this means: 5,000 angels wearing turbans of wool.", "Generated_Answer": "You're asking an excellent and nuanced question that touches upon several important principles in Islamic fiqh, particularly concerning *'urf* (custom) and *tashabbuh* (imitation). Your understanding that there isn't a *complete* consensus and that imitating women and wearing gold are forbidden for men is very accurate and forms the core of the discussion.\n\nLet's break down the classical fiqh perspective on men wearing earrings:\n\n### Core Principles Guiding the Discussion\n\n1.  **Imitation of Women (*Tashabbuh bi al-Nisa'*):** This is the primary prohibition. Islam discourages men from imitating women and vice-versa in dress, adornment, and mannerisms that are specific to one gender. The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) cursed men who imitate women and women who imitate men (Bukhari).\n    *   **Key Consideration:** What constitutes \"imitation\" is heavily dependent on *cultural norms* (*'urf*). If an adornment is universally or predominantly considered female adornment in a given society, then a man wearing it would fall under *tashabbuh*.\n\n2.  **Wearing Gold for Men:** It is unanimously forbidden for men to wear gold (e.g., rings, chains, earrings, watches) due to specific prophetic narrations. Silver is generally permissible for men (e.g., a silver ring).\n\n3.  **Seeking Undue Attention (*Shuhrah*):** While not a primary prohibition for earrings specifically, generally, Islam discourages dress or adornment that is meant solely to draw excessive attention to oneself or to appear ostentatious or eccentric, especially if it goes against the common, modest dress of the righteous.\n\n### Classical Fiqh Views on Men's Earrings\n\nBased on these principles, the vast majority of classical scholars across all four main Sunni schools (Hanafi, Maliki, Shafi'i, Hanbali) considered it **forbidden (haram) or severely disliked (makruh tahrimi)** for men to wear earrings.\n\n**The primary reasoning was *tashabbuh bi al-nisa'***:\n*   In the societies and cultures where classical fiqh was developed and predominantly applied, earrings were almost exclusively an adornment for women. Therefore, a man wearing them would be directly imitating women.\n*   This was seen as going against the natural disposition (*fitra*) and the distinction between genders that Islam upholds.\n\n**Specific Points:**\n\n*   **Gold Earrings:** Absolutely forbidden for men by consensus.\n*   **Other Materials (Silver, Wood, Stone, etc.):** Even if not gold, if the item is an earring and earrings are culturally specific to women, then it would still be forbidden due to *tashabbuh*.\n\n### The Role of Custom (*'Urf*) and Your Observation\n\nThis is where your observation about Arabian and African Muslim tribesmen becomes highly relevant.\n\n*   **Cultural Context Matters:** Classical scholars understood that *'urf* can define what constitutes \"imitation.\" If, in a *specific* culture or tribal tradition, certain types of earrings were historically or are currently a *recognized and accepted form of male adornment* (and not associated with effeminacy), then the argument of *tashabbuh bi al-nisa'* becomes significantly weaker, or even invalid, within that specific context.\n*   **Historical Examples:** You're right. In some specific Bedouin tribes, African tribes (e.g., Tuareg, Fulani, some Maasai groups), and even some historical seafaring communities, men traditionally wore earrings, often single ones, made of silver, bone, or wood. These were seen as part of their male identity and tradition, not as an imitation of women.\n*   **Contemporary Application:**\n    *   **General Rule:** In most modern Muslim societies, and particularly in Western societies where the \"norm\" is largely influenced by general societal perceptions, earrings are still predominantly associated with women. Therefore, a man wearing an earring in such contexts would generally be considered *haram* or *makruh tahrimi* by most contemporary scholars, due to the principle of *tashabbuh*.\n    *   **Specific Exceptions:** If someone lives in a very specific, isolated community or tribe where men have genuinely worn earrings as part of their male attire for generations without it being seen as effeminate, then the ruling might differ for *that specific group*. However, this is a very niche exception.\n\n### Regarding the \"Wooden Cuffs on the Ears\"\n\nThis is an interesting distinction:\n\n*   **Not a Piercing:** If they are cuffs that sit on the ear and don't involve piercing, they might be seen differently than traditional pierced earrings.\n*   **Perception:** The key is still *perception* and *'urf*.\n    *   If these wooden cuffs are *not* generally perceived as feminine adornment in his current society (i.e., men and women both wear them, or they are clearly marketed as unisex, or men predominantly wear them in his specific subculture), then the *tashabbuh* argument is significantly weakened.\n    *   If they are, however, perceived as a fashion trend primarily associated with women or effeminacy, then it would still fall under the general prohibition.\n*   **Material:** Wood is permissible as a material, unlike gold.\n\n### Summary and Advice for the Convert\n\n1.  **General Rule:** For the vast majority of Muslims globally, and certainly for someone converting to Islam who seeks to align with mainstream Islamic practice, the general classical ruling is that men should **avoid** wearing earrings. This is primarily due to the strong prohibition against imitating women (*tashabbuh bi al-nisa'*) in contexts where earrings are primarily a female adornment.\n2.  **Gold is Out:** Absolutely no gold earrings for men.\n3.  **Cultural Context (*'Urf*) is Key:** The rare exceptions you observed in tribal communities are precisely because in those *specific cultures*, earrings were *not* considered an imitation of women. This is a very localized cultural factor and does not apply broadly.\n4.  **Wooden Cuffs:** If these wooden cuffs are genuinely *not* perceived as a feminine adornment in his local society and are simply a form of general, gender-neutral jewelry, then the prohibition of *tashabbuh* would not apply. However, if they are still seen as part of a fashion trend primarily associated with women, then it would be best to avoid them.\n5.  **Seeking Piety:** For someone newly embracing Islam, the general advice is often to err on the side of caution and adopt practices that are widely accepted and remove any doubt. Simple, universally accepted male adornments like a silver ring are always permissible.\n\nIn conclusion, while the material (wood) is permissible, the primary concern remains whether the item (earring/cuff) is culturally perceived as exclusive to or predominantly associated with women in the inquirer's specific context. If so, it would be best for him to avoid it."}

Urine is considered a type of najasa (impurity) that nullifies purity for prayer.\n2.  **Wetness Facilitates Transfer:** The fact that both sets of clothes were wet makes the transfer of impurity almost certain. Water acts as a medium for the impurity to spread.\n3.  **Requirement for Prayer:** For your clothes to be valid for prayer (Salat), they must be free from impurities. If there's a doubt or certainty of impurity transfer, they need to be purified again.\n\n**How to purify them:**\n\nPut the affected \"clean wet clothes\" back into the washing machine and run them through a full wash cycle with clean water and detergent.

So I proceeded with Allahs Apostle after Allahs order of veiling (the women) had been revealed and thus I was carried in my howdah (on a camel) and dismounted while still in it. We carried on our journey, and when Allahs Apostle had finished his Ghazwa and returned and we approached Medina, Allahs Apostle ordered to proceed at night.

At that time women were light in weight and were not fleshy for they used to eat little (food), so those people did not feel the lightness of the howdah while raising it up, and I was still a young lady. They drove away the camel and proceeded. Then I found my necklace after the army had gone. I came to their camp but found nobody therein so I went to the place where I used to stay, thinking that they would miss me and come back in my search. While I was sitting at my place, I felt sleepy and slept. Safwan bin Al-Muattil As-Sulami Adh- Dhakw-ani was behind the army. He had started in the last part of the night and reached my stationing place in the morning and saw the figure of a sleeping person. He came to me and recognized me on seeing me for he used to see me before veiling. I got up because of his saying: \"Inna Li l-lahi wa inna ilaihi rajiun,\" which he uttered on recognizing me. I covered my face with my garment, and by Allah, he did not say to me a single word except, \"Inna Li l-lahi wa inna ilaihi rajiun,\" till he made his shecamel kneel down whereupon he trod on its forelegs and I mounted it. Then Safwan set out, leading the she-camel that was carrying me, till we met the army while they were resting during the hot midday. Then whoever was meant for destruction, fell in destruction, and the leader of the Ifk (forged statement) was `Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul. After this we arrived at Medina and I became ill for one month while the people were spreading the forged statements of the people of the Ifk, and I was not aware of anything thereof. But what aroused my doubt while I was sick, was that I was no longer receiving from Allahs Apostle the same kindness as I used to receive when I fell sick. Allahs Apostle would enter upon me, say a greeting and add, \"How is that (lady)?\" and then depart. That aroused my suspicion but I was not aware of the propagated evil till I recovered from my ailment. I went out with Um Mistah to answer the call of nature towards Al-Manasi, the place where we used to relieve ourselves, and used not to go out for this purpose except from night to night, and that was before we had lavatories close to our houses. And this habit of ours was similar to the habit of the old Arabs (in the deserts or in the tents) concerning the evacuation of the bowels, for we considered it troublesome and harmful to take lavatories in the houses. So I went out with Um Mistah who was the daughter of Abi Ruhm bin `Abd Manaf, and her mother was daughter of Sakhr bin Amir who was the aunt of Abi Bakr As-Siddiq, and her son was Mistah bin Uthatha. When we had finished our affair, Um Mistah and I came back towards my house. Um Mistah stumbled over her robe whereupon she said, \"Let Mistah be ruined ! \" I said to her, \"What a bad word you have said! Do you abuse a man who has taken part in the Battle of Badr? She said, \"O you there! Didnt you hear what he has said?\" I said, \"And what did he say?\" She then told me the statement of the people of the Ifk (forged statement) which added to my ailment. When I returned home, Allahs Apostle came to me, and after greeting, he said, \"How is that (lady)?\" I said, \"Will you allow me to go to my parents?\" At that time I intended to be sure of the news through them. Allahs Apostle allowed me and I went to my parents and asked my mother, \"O my mother! What are the people talking about?\" My mother said, \"O my daughter! Take it easy, for by Allah, there is no charming lady who is loved by her husband who has other wives as well, but that those wives would find fault with her.\" I said, \"Subhan Allah! Did the people really talk about that?\" That night I kept on weeping the whole night till the morning. My tears never stopped, nor did I sleep, and morning broke while I was still weeping, Allahs Apostle called `Ali bin Abi Talib and Usama bin Zaid when the Divine Inspiration delayed, in order to consult them as to the idea of divorcing his wife. Usama bin Zaid told Allahs Apostle of what he knew about the innocence of his wife and of his affection he kept for her. He said, \"O Allahs Apostle! She is your wife, and we do not know anything about her except good.\" But `Ali bin Abi Talib said, \"O Allahs Apostle! Allah does not impose restrictions on you; and there are plenty of women other than her. If you however, ask (her) slave girl, she will tell you the truth.\" `Aisha added: So Allahs Apostle called for Barira and said, \"O Barira! Did you ever see anything which might have aroused your suspicion? (as regards Aisha). Barira said, \"By Allah Who has sent you with the truth, I have never seen anything regarding Aisha which I would blame her for except that she is a girl of immature age who sometimes sleeps and leaves the dough of her family unprotected so that the domestic goats come and eat it.\" So Allahs Apostle got up (and addressed) the people an asked for somebody who would take revenge on `Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul then. Allahs Apostle, while on the pulpit, said, \"O Muslims! Who will help me against a man who has hurt me by slandering my family? By Allah, I know nothing except good about my family, and people have blamed a man of whom I know nothing except good, and he never used to visit my family except with me,\" Sa`d bin Mu`adh Al-Ansari got up and said, \"O Allahs Apostle! By Allah, I will relieve you from him. If he be from the tribe of (Bani) Al-Aus, then I will chop his head off; and if he be from our brethren, the Khazraj, then you give us your order and we will obey it.\" On that, Sa`d bin Ubada got up, and he was the chief of the Khazraj, and before this incident he had been a pious man but he was incited by his zeal for his tribe. He said to Sa`d (bin Mu`adh), \"By Allah the Eternal, you have told a lie! You shall not kill him and you will never be able to kill him!\" On that, Usaid bin Hudair, the cousin of Sa`d (bin Mu`adh) got up and said to Sa`d bin Ubada, \"You are a liar! By Allah the Eternal, we will surely kill him; and you are a hypocrite defending the hypocrites!\" So the two tribes of Al-Aus and Al-Khazraj got excited till they were on the point of fighting with each other while Allahs Apostle was standing on the pulpit. Allahs Apostle continued quietening them till they became silent whereupon he became silent too. On that day I kept on weeping so much that neither did my tears stop, nor could I sleep. In the morning my parents were with me, and I had wept for two nights and a day without sleeping and with incessant tears till they thought that my liver would burst with weeping. While they were with me and I was weeping, an Ansari woman asked permission to see me. I admitted her and she sat and started weeping with me. While I was in that state, Allahs Apostle came to us, greeted, and sat down,. He had never sat with me since the day what was said, was said. He had stayed a month without receiving any Divine Inspiration concerning my case. Allahs Apostle recited the Tashahhud after he had sat down, and then said, \"Thereafter, O `Aisha! I have been informed such and-such a thing about you; and if you are innocent, Allah will reveal your innocence, and if you have committed a sin, then ask for Allahs forgiveness and repent to Him, for when a slave confesses his sin and then repents to Allah, Allah accepts his repentance.\" When Allahs Apostle had finished his speech, my tears ceased completely so that I no longer felt even a drop thereof. Then I said to my father, \"Reply to Allahs Apostle on my behalf as to what he said.\" He said, \"By Allah, I do not know what to say to Allahs Apostle.\" Then I said to my mother, \"Reply to Allahs Apostle.\" She said, \"I do not know what to say to Allahs Apostle.\" Still a young girl as I was and though I had little knowledge of Quran, I said, \"By Allah, I know that you heard this story (of the Ifk) so much so that it has been planted in your minds and you have believed it. So now, if I tell you that I am innocent, and Allah knows that I am innocent, you will not believe me; and if I confess something, and Allah knows that I am innocent of it, you will believe me. By Allah, I cannot find of you an example except that of Josephs father: \"So (for me) patience is most fitting against that which you assert and it is Allah (Alone) Whose help can be sought. Then I turned away and lay on my bed, and at that time I knew that I was innocent and that Allah would reveal my innocence. But by Allah, I never thought that Allah would sent down about my affair, Divine Inspiration that would be recited (forever), as I considered myself too unworthy to be talked of by Allah with something that was to be recited: but I hoped that Allahs Apostle might have a vision in which Allah would prove my innocence. By Allah, Allahs Apostle had not left his seat and nobody had left the house when the Divine Inspiration came to Allahs Apostle . So there overtook him the same hard condition which used to overtake him (when he was Divinely Inspired) so that the drops of his sweat were running down, like pearls, though it was a (cold) winter day, and that was because of the heaviness of the Statement which was revealed to him. When that state of Allahs Apostle was over, and he was smiling when he was relieved, the first word he said was, \"Aisha, Allah has declared your innocence.\" My mother said to me, \"Get up and go to him.\" I said, \"By Allah, I will not go to him and I will not thank anybody but Allah.\" So Allah revealed: \"Verily! They who spread the Slander are a gang among you. Think it not....\" (24.11-20). When Allah revealed this to confirm my innocence, Abu Bakr As-Siddiq who used to provide for Mistah bin Uthatha because of the latters kinship to him and his poverty, said, \"By Allah, I will never provide for Mistah anything after what he has said about Aisha\". So Allah revealed: (continued...) (continuing... 1): -6.274:... ... \"Let not those among you who are good and are wealthy swear not to give (help) to their kinsmen, those in need, and those who have left their homes for Allahs Cause. Let them Pardon and forgive (i.e. do not punish them). Do you not love that should forgive you? Verily Allah is Oft-forgiving. Most Merciful.\" (24.22) Abu Bakr said, \"Yes, by Allah, I wish that Allah should forgive me.\" So he resumed giving Mistah the aid he used to give him before and said, \"By Allah, I will never withold it from him at all.\" Aisha further said: Allahs Apostle also asked Zainab bint Jahsh about my case. He said, \"O Zainab! What have you seen?\" She replied, \"O Allahs Apostle! I protect my hearing and my sight (by refraining from telling lies). I know nothing but good (about Aisha).\" Of all the wives of Allahs Apostle, it was Zainab who aspired to receive from him the same favor as I used to receive, yet, Allah saved her (from telling lies) because of her piety. But her sister, Hamna, kept on fighting on her behalf so she was destroyed as were those who invented and spread the slander.<D>Narrated Aisha:(the wife of the Prophet) \"Whenever Allahs Apostle intended to go on a journey, he would draw lots amongst his wives and would take with him the one upon whom the lot fell. During a Ghazwa of his, he drew lots amongst us and the lot fell upon me, and I proceeded with him after Allah had decreed the use of the veil by women. I was carried in a Howdah (on the camel) and dismounted while still in it. When Allahs Apostle was through with his Ghazwa and returned home, and we approached the city of Medina, Allahs Apostle ordered us to proceed at night. When the order of setting off was given, I walked till I was past the army to answer the call of nature. After finishing I returned (to the camp) to depart (with the others) and suddenly realized that my necklace over my chest was missing. So, I returned to look for it and was delayed because of that. The people who used to carry me on the camel, came to my Howdah and put it on the back of the camel, thinking that I was in it, as, at that time, women were light in weight, and thin and lean, and did not use to eat much. So, those people did not feel the difference in the heaviness of the Howdah while lifting it, and they put it over the camel. At that time I was a young lady. They set the camel moving and proceeded on. I found my necklace after the army had gone, and came to their camp to find nobody. So, I went to the place where I used to stay, thinking that they would discover my absence and come back in my search. While in that state, I felt sleepy and slept. Safwan bin Muattal As-Sulami Adh-Dhakwani was behind the army and reached my abode in the morning. When he saw a sleeping person, he came to me, and he used to see me before veiling. So, I got up when I heard him saying, \"Inna lil-lah-wa inn a ilaihi rajiun (We are for Allah, and we will return to Him).\" He made his camel knell down. He got down from his camel, and put his leg on the front legs of the camel and then I rode and sat over it. Safwan set out walking, leading the camel by the rope till we reached the army who had halted to take rest at midday. Then whoever was meant for destruction, fell into destruction, (some people accused me falsely) and the leader of the false accusers was `Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul. After that we returned to Medina, and I became ill for one month while the people were spreading the forged statements of the false accusers. I was feeling during my ailment as if I were not receiving the usual kindness from the Prophet which I used to receive from him when I got sick. But he would come, greet and say, How is that (girl)? I did not know anything of what was going on till I recovered from my ailment and went out with Um Mistah to the Manasi where we used to answer the call of nature, and we used not to go to answer the call of nature except from night to night and that was before we had lavatories near to our houses. And this habit of ours was similar to the habit of the old Arabs in the open country (or away from houses). So. I and Um Mistah bint Ruhm went out walking. Um Mistah stumbled because of her long dress and on that she said, Let Mistah be ruined. I said, You are saying a bad word. Why are you abusing a man who took part in (the battle of) Badr? She said, O Hanata (you there) didnt you hear what they said? Then she told me the rumors of the false accusers. My sickness was aggravated, and when I returned home, Allahs Apostle came to me, and after greeting he said, How is that (girl)? I requested him to allow me to go to my parents. I wanted then to be sure of the news through them I Allahs Apostle allowed me, and I went to my parents and asked my mother, What are the people talking about? She said, O my daughter! Dont worry much about this matter. By Allah, never is there a charming woman loved by her husband who has other wives, but the women would forge false news about her. I said, Glorified be Allah! Are the people really taking of this matter? That night I kept on weeping and could not sleep till morning. In the morning Allahs Apostle called `Ali bin Abu Talib and Usama bin Zaid when he saw the Divine Inspiration delayed, to consul them about divorcing his wife (i.e. `Aisha). Usama bin Zaid said what he knew of the good reputation of his wives and added, O Allahs Apostle! Keep you wife, for, by Allah, we know nothing about her but good. `Ali bin Abu Talib said, O Allahs Apostle! Allah has no imposed restrictions on you, and there are many women other than she, yet you may ask the woman-servant who will tell you the truth. On that Allahs Apostle called Buraira and said, O Burair. Did you ever see anything which roused your suspicions about her? Buraira said, No, by Allah Who has sent you with the Truth, I have never seen in her anything faulty except that she is a girl of immature age, who sometimes sleeps and leaves the dough for the goats to eat. On that day Allahs Apostle ascended the pulpit and requested that somebody support him in punishing `Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul. Allahs Apostle said, Who will support me to punish that person (`Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul) who has hurt me by slandering the reputation of my family? By Allah, I know nothing about my family but good, and they have accused a person about whom I know nothing except good, and he never entered my house except in my company. Sa`d bin Mu`adh got up and said, O Allahs Apostle! by Allah, I will relieve you from him. If that man is from the tribe of the Aus, then we will chop his head off, and if he is from our brothers, the Khazraj, then order us, and we will fulfill your order. On that Sa`d bin Ubada, the chief of the Khazraj and before this incident, he had been a pious man, got up, motivated by his zeal for his tribe and said, By Allah, you have told a lie; you cannot kill him, and you will never be able to kill him. On that Usaid bin Al-Hadir got up and said (to Sa`d bin Ubada), By Allah! you are a liar. By Allah, we will kill him; and you are a hypocrite, defending the hypocrites. On this the two tribes of Aus and Khazraj got excited and were about to fight each other, while Allahs Apostle was standing on the pulpit. He got down and quieted them till they became silent and he kept quiet. On that day I kept on weeping so much so that neither did my tears stop, nor could I sleep. In the morning my parents were with me and I had wept for two nights and a day, till I thought my liver would burst from weeping. While they were sitting with me and I was weeping, an Ansari woman asked my permission to enter, and I allowed her to come in. She sat down and started weeping with me. While we were in this state, Allahs Apostle came and sat down and he had never sat with me since the day they forged the accusation. No revelation regarding my case came to him for a month. He recited Tashah-hud (i.e. None has the right to be worshipped but Allah and Muhammad is His Apostle) and then said, O `Aisha! I have been informed such-and-such about you; if you are innocent, then Allah will soon reveal your innocence, and if you have committed a sin, then repent to Allah and ask Him to forgive you, for when a person confesses his sin and asks Allah for forgiveness, Allah accepts his repentance. When Allahs Apostle finished his speech my tears ceased completely and there remained not even a single drop of it. I requested my father to reply to Allahs Apostle on my behalf. My father said, By Allah, I do not know what to say to Allahs Apostle. I said to my mother, Talk to Allahs Apostle on my behalf. She said, By Allah, I do not know what to say to Allahs Apostle. I was a young girl and did not have much knowledge of the Quran. I said. I know, by Allah, that you have listened to what people are saying and that has been planted in your minds and you have taken it as a truth. Now, if I told you that I am innocent and Allah knows that I am innocent, you would not believe me and if I confessed to you falsely that I am guilty, and Allah knows that I am innocent you would believe me. By Allah, I dont compare my situation with you except to the situation of Josephs father (i.e. Jacob) who said, So (for me) patience is most fitting against that which you assert and it is Allah (Alone) whose help can be sought. Then I turned to the other side of my bed hoping that Allah would prove my innocence. By Allah I never thought that Allah would reveal Divine Inspiration in my case, as I considered myself too inferior to be talked of in the Holy Quran. I had hoped that Allahs Apostle might have a dream in which Allah would prove my innocence. By Allah, Allahs Apostle had not got up and nobody had left the house before the Divine Inspiration came to Allahs Apostle. So, there overtook him the same state which used to overtake him, (when he used to have, on being inspired divinely). He was sweating so much so that the drops of the sweat were dropping like pearls though it was a (cold) wintry day. When that state of Allahs Apostle was over, he was smiling and the first word he said, `Aisha! Thank Allah, for Allah has declared your innocence. My mother told me to go to Allahs Apostle . I replied, By Allah I will not go to him and will not thank but Allah. So Allah revealed: \"Verily! They who spread the slander are a gang among you . . .\" (24.11) When Allah gave the declaration of my Innocence, Abu Bakr, who used to provide for Mistah bin Uthatha for he was his relative, said, By Allah, I will never provide Mistah with anything because of what he said about Aisha. But Allah later revealed: -- \"And let not those who are good and wealthy among you swear not to help their kinsmen, those in need and those who left their homes in Allahs Cause. Let them forgive and overlook. Do you not wish that Allah should forgive you? Verily! Allah is Oft-forgiving, Most Merciful.\" (24.22) After that Abu Bakr said, Yes ! By Allah! I like that Allah should forgive me, and resumed helping Mistah whom he used to help before. Allahs Apostle also asked Zainab bint Jahsh (i.e. the Prophets wife about me saying, What do you know and what did you see? She replied, O Allahs Apostle! I refrain to claim hearing or seeing what I have not heard or seen. By Allah, I know nothing except goodness about Aisha.\" Aisha further added \"Zainab was competing with me (in her beauty and the Prophets love), yet Allah protected her (from being malicious), for she had piety.\"<D>It was narraterd from Jabir bin Abdullah that, during the year of the Conquest, while he was in Makkah, he heard the Messenger of Allah say:\"Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, and His Messenger have forbidden the sale of alcohol, dead meat, pigs and idols.\" It was said to him: \"O Messenger of Allah, what do you think of their fat of dead animals, for it is used to caulk ships, it is daubed on animal skins, and people use it to light their lamps?\" He said: \"No, it is unlawful.\" Then the Messenger of Allah said: \"May Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, curse the Jews, for Allah forbade them the fat (of dead animals) but they rendered it, sold it, and consumed its price.\"<D>Then He explained to them further, saying: (A day) on a Day (when He will call you) when Seraphiel will call you upon the blowing of the trumpet (and ye will answer with His praise) you will answer the caller of Allah by His command, (and ye will think that ye have tarried but a little while) you will think that you havestayed in your graves but a short time.<D>(What then is your opinion of the Lord of the Worlds) what do you think He will do to you if you worship other than Him?<D>The following was revealed about Abu Jahl Ibn Hisham, al-Walid Ibn al-Mughirah and Utbah and Shaybah the sons of Rabiah who had duals with Ali Ibn Abi Talib, may Allah be well pleased with him, Hamzah IbnAbd al-Muttalib, the uncle of the Prophet (pbuh) and Ubaydah Ibn al-Harth Ibn Abd al-Muttalib on the Dayof Badr; some of them boasted to others, and so Allah said: (Or do those who do ill deeds) in their state of associating partners with Allah (imagine that they can outstrip Us) that they will evade Our punishment: (Evil (for them) is that which they decide) evil is that which they judge and think for themselves.", "Generated_Answer": "This is a very common challenge, and it stems from what is known as **Wasaawis (obsessive whispers/doubts)**, which are from Shaytan (Satan) to make your worship difficult and burdensome. The key to dealing with Wasaawis is to **ignore them completely**.\n\nHere's a breakdown of advice based on Islamic principles:\n\n1.  **The Principle of Certainty (Yaqeen) vs. Doubt (Shakk):**\n    *   A fundamental principle in Islam is that **certainty is not removed by doubt.**\n    *   If you were certain your body/clothes were clean before urinating, they remain clean unless you have *absolute certainty* (seeing it, smelling it, feeling it distinctly) that impurity has landed on them.\n    *   A slight feeling, a hair moving, or a phantom sensation is a doubt, not certainty. Therefore, you **must assume it's clean.**\n\n2.  **Do NOT Check:**\n    *   **Absolutely do NOT check or feel with your hand.** This is precisely what Shaytan wants you to do.\n    *   When you check, you feed the Wasaawis. It creates more anxiety, more questions (\"Did I feel it? Was it dry? Did I spread it?\").\n    *   If you *don't know for sure* that something has splashed, assume nothing has splashed. That slight feeling is almost certainly a doubt from Shaytan or just a normal sensation.\n\n3.  **Regarding Spreading Impurity:**\n    *   You are absolutely right. If you *do* check when unsure, you might indeed spread something that was tiny and negligible, or even spread nothing at all but then create the *doubt* that you did. This makes the situation worse.\n    *   By *not checking*, you prevent this potential spreading and avoid giving in to the doubt.\n\n4.  **Namaz Validity:**\n    *   **Your Namaz will absolutely be valid.**\n    *   If you have doubts about a tiny splash (especially if you haven't seen it or confirmed it visually/olfactorily), Islam does not burden you with having to clean it. Such tiny, unconfirmed amounts are generally overlooked.\n    *   The Prophet (peace be upon him) taught ease, not difficulty. If every minor, unconfirmed splash meant repeating Wudu or changing clothes, it would make worship incredibly burdensome, which is contrary to the spirit of Islam.\n    *   The \"less than 50p\" (or a small coin's size) rule often refers to an *actual, confirmed* impurity that is very small. In your case, you don't even have *confirmation*.\n\n5.  **Practical Steps to Combat Wasaawis:**\n\n    *   **Ignore, Ignore, Ignore:** This is the most crucial advice. When you get that feeling or thought:\n        *   Tell yourself, \"This is Wasaawis from Shaytan. I will ignore it.\"\n        *   Immediately busy yourself with something else or continue with your task (like finishing urination, performing Wudu, or praying).\n    *   **Do Not Repeat Wudu/Ghusl/Namaz:** If you have done an act of worship, and then doubts come, **do not repeat it.** Repeating feeds the Wasaawis.\n    *   **Seek Refuge in Allah:** Say \"A'udhu billahi minash Shaytanir rajim\" (I seek refuge in Allah from the accursed Shaytan) immediately when the thought comes.\n    *   **Understand Shaytan's Goal:** He wants to make you anxious, miserable, and eventually give up on worship by making it seem too difficult or impossible to perform correctly. Don't let him win.\n    *   **Focus on the Act of Worship:** When praying, focus on the words, their meaning, and your connection with Allah, not on these external doubts.\n    *   **Assume Purity:** Always assume your body, clothes, and the place of prayer are pure unless you have definite, undeniable evidence to the contrary.\n\n**In summary:**\n\nYou are taking good precautions by putting tissue down. That's commendable. However, the next step is to **trust that your precautions are sufficient and completely ignore any lingering doubts or sensations.**\n\nIf you feel something, tell yourself, \"That's just a hair, or my clothes, or my imagination, or just a random sensation. It is NOT urine unless I see it.\" Then, **do not check it, do not clean it, and do not let it worry you.**\n\nYour Namaz is valid, and Allah (SWT) knows your intentions and your struggle. He rewards you for striving to overcome these whispers. The path to breaking the cycle of Wasaawis is to actively and consistently ignore them."}
{"Question": "Q: Tayammum was made for ghusal on a severe winters morning as there was no intizaam for hot water. 1. When does the Tayammum expire? 2. Does the fajr salaah need to be repeated? ? --T--", "Answer": "If the water is so cold that one fears that one will become sick and there is no means to make the water hot, then it will be permissible to make tayammum and perform Salaah. 1. The tayammum will expire once one finds water one is able to use. 2. No And Allah Taala ( ) knows best", "Document": "Shaqiq said:While I was sitting between Abd Allah and Abu Musa, the latter said: Abu Abd al-Rahman, what do you think if a man becomes defiled (because of seminal omission) and does not find water for a month; should he not perform tayammum ? He replied: No, even if he does not find water for a month. Abu Musa then said: How will you do with the Quranic version (about tayammum) in the chapter al-Maidah which says: \"... and you find no water, then go to clean, high ground\" (5:6)? Abd Allah (b. Masud) then said: If they (the people) are granted concession in this respect, they might perform tayammum with pure earth when water is cold. Abu Musa said: For this (reason) you forbade it ? He said: Yes. Abu Musa then said: Did you not hear what Ammar said to Umar ? (He said): The Messenger of Allah () sent me on some errand. I had seminal emission and I did not find water. Therefore, I rolled on the ground just as an animal rolls down. I then came to the Prophet () and made a mention of that to him. He said: It would have been enough for you to do thus. Then he struck the ground with his hands and shook them off and then stuck the right hand with his left hand and his left hand with his right hand (and wiped) over his hands (up to the wrist) and wiped his face. Abd Allah then said to him: Did you not see that Umar was not satisfied with the statement of Ammar ?<D>Ammar bin Yasir narrated that :the Prophet ordered him to perform Tayammum by rubbing his face and two palms.<D>It is reported that Ata did not approve of performing ablution with milk and nabidh and said:tayammum is more my liking (than performing ablution with milk and nabidh).<D>(And that He it is Who enricheth) He made Himself independent of the need for created beings (and contenteth) and He made His slaves needy for Him; it is also said that this means: He made some rich with gold and silver and others content with the possession of camels, bovines and sheep.<D>(And if ye fear that ye will not deal fairly by the orphans) and if you fear that you will not preserve orphans wealth, you should also fear not dealing fairly with women in relation to providing sustenance and apportionment. This was because they used to marry as many women as they liked, as many as nine or ten. Qays Ibn al-Harth for example had eight wives. Allah forbade them from doing so and prohibited them from marrying more than four wives, saying: (marry of the women, who seem good to you) marry that which Allah has made lawful for you, (two or three or four) marry one, two, three or four but do not marry more than four wives; (and if ye fear that ye cannot do justice) to four wives in relation to apportionment and providing sustenance (then one (only)) then marry only one free woman (or that your right hands possess) of captives, and in that case you do not owe them any apportionment, and they need not observe any waiting period. (Thus it) marrying just one woman (is more likely that ye will not do injustice) that you will not incline to some at the expense of others or that you transgress regarding the provision of sustenanceand apportionment to four wives.<D>(Know that Allah is severe in punishment) towards him who declares lawful that which Allah has made unlawful, (but that Allah (also) is Forgiving) He overlooks mistakes, (Merciful) towards the person who repents.", "Generated_Answer": "This is a common question, and the rulings depend slightly on the specific Islamic school of thought (Madhhab), but I will provide the widely accepted view, particularly relevant to Hanafi Fiqh which is common in many parts of the world.\n\nLet's break down your questions:\n\n---\n\n### 1. When does the Tayammum expire?\n\nTayammum expires when the *reason* for making it ceases to exist. In your scenario, the reason was the severe cold and lack of hot water, making it harmful to use cold water for ghusl.\n\nTherefore, your Tayammum for ghusl will expire when:\n\n1.  **Hot water becomes available:** As soon as you can obtain hot water to perform ghusl without harm.\n2.  **The weather warms up sufficiently:** If the severe cold subsides to a point where using cold water for ghusl would no longer cause illness or harm.\n\n**Important Note:** Until one of these conditions is met, your Tayammum remains valid for performing prayers and other acts requiring ritual purity (like touching the Quran, entering a mosque, etc.), provided that the *conditions that break wudu* (passing wind, urine, stool, deep sleep, etc.) do not occur. If any of those conditions occur, you would need to make Tayammum again for wudu (if water is still unavailable) or perform wudu with water (if water becomes available). However, the primary obligation to make *ghusl with water* remains until it's possible.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Does the Fajr Salaah need to be repeated?\n\n**According to the Hanafi Madhhab (and some other scholars):**\n\nNo, the Fajr Salaah performed with that Tayammum **does not need to be repeated.**\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n*   You performed the Tayammum for ghusl under a valid Islamic necessity (severe cold, no hot water, fear of harm).\n*   At the time you prayed Fajr, your Tayammum was valid, and the prayer was performed correctly according to the conditions of the time.\n*   The later availability of water (or change in conditions) does not retroactively invalidate a prayer that was performed validly when the necessity existed.\n\n**Difference of Opinion (Briefly):**\n\nIt's worth noting that some other schools of thought, particularly the **Shafi'i Madhhab**, would generally require the prayer to be repeated (qada) if water becomes available *within the prayer time*. However, for situations like severe cold leading to fear of harm, many scholars would lean towards the prayer being valid and not requiring repetition even in the Shafi'i school, especially if no alternative was realistically available. Given your phrasing, the Hanafi view of non-repetition is the most common answer in such scenarios.\n\n---\n\n**In summary:**\n\n1.  Your Tayammum for ghusl expires when hot water becomes available or the weather warms up sufficiently for you to use cold water without harm.\n2.  Your Fajr prayer performed with that Tayammum is valid and **does not need to be repeated** (according to the dominant view in such cases).\n\nOnce you are able to perform ghusl with water, you must do so."}
{"Question": "Q: I washed my clothes in the washing machine, one item of clothing, a raincoat which is made from waterproof material came out dripping a bit, but the rest of the clothes were wet but not dripping. Are my clothes clean still? ? --T--", "Answer": "Yes. And Allah Taala ( ) knows best", "Document": "The tradition mentioned above has also been narrated by Al ‘Umm Athiyah from the Prophet () through a different chain of narrators. The tradition narrated by Yazid bin Harun from Hisham does perfectly correspond to the tradition transmitted by Ibrahim bin Tahman and ‘Abd Allah Al Shami from Hisham. The narrator Al Misma’I reported Yazid as saying “I do not know but that he said “she should not dye herself.” To this the narrator Harun added “She should not wear colored clothes except one of the types made of dyed yarn.”<D>Narrated Aisha, Ummul Muminin:By Allah, we did not know whether we should take off the clothes of the Messenger of Allah () as we took off the clothes of our dead, or wash him while his clothes were on him. When they (the people) differed among themselves, Allah cast slumber over them until every one of them had put his chin on his chest. Then a speaker spoke from a side of the house, and they did not know who he was: Wash the Prophet () while his clothes are on him. So they stood round the Prophet () and washed him while he had his shirt on him. They poured water on his shirt, and rubbed him with his shirt and not with their hands. Aisha used to say: If I had known beforehand about my affair what I found out later, none would have washed him except his wives.<D>Ubayy b. Ka’b reported :The Messenger of Allah (May peace be upon him) made a concession in the early days of Islam on account of the paucity of clothes that one should not take a bath if one has sexual intercourse (and has no seminal emission). But later on her commanded to take a bath in such a case and prohibited its omission.<D>(It is no sin for them) the wives of the Prophet (pbuh) as well as the wives of the believers (with their fathers) that their fathers should enter in on them or converse with them, (or their sons: or their brothers, or their brothers sons, or the sons of their sisters) from the fathers side or the mothers side (or of theirown women) the women who belong to their own religion; for it is unlawful for a Muslim woman to strip herself of her clothes in front of Jewish, Christian or Magian women, (or their slaves) i.e. women slaves, not male slaves. (O women! Keep your duty to Allah) fear Allah about all these in relation to their entering in on you and their conversation with you. (Lo! Allah is Witness over all things) relating to your works.<D>(So this day) which is the Day of Judgement (no ransom can be taken from you) O group of hypocrites (nor from those who disbelieved) in Muhammad (pbuh) and the Quran.

(This) the raiment of cotton (is of the revelations of Allah) of the marvels of Allah, (that they may remember) take admonition.", "Generated_Answer": "Yes, your clothes are almost certainly **clean**.\n\nThe difference in wetness between your raincoat and the other clothes is almost entirely due to the **material of the raincoat** and how washing machines extract water.\n\nHere's why:\n\n1.  **Waterproof Material (Raincoat):**\n    *   **Doesn't Absorb Water:** Unlike cotton, polyester, or other common clothing materials that absorb water into their fibers, waterproof fabrics are designed to repel water.\n    *   **Spin Cycle Challenge:** When the washing machine spins, it relies on centrifugal force to \"sling\" water out of the fabric. For absorbent materials, water is *soaked into* the fibers, and the spin cycle effectively squeezes and flings that water out. For a waterproof raincoat, the water largely sits *on the surface* or gets trapped in the lining, seams, or folds. The spin cycle might not be as effective at removing all the surface tension or beaded water as it is at extracting water from within absorbent fibers. It's essentially trying to \"throw off\" water that isn't deeply embedded.\n    *   **DWR Coating:** If your raincoat has a Durable Water Repellent (DWR) coating, water will bead up on the surface. While this is great for repelling rain, those beads can sometimes be harder for the spin cycle to completely remove compared to water soaked into other fabrics.\n\n2.  **Other Clothes (Wet but Not Dripping):**\n    *   This is a **normal outcome** for most clothing after a standard wash and spin cycle. The machine has extracted the majority of the water, leaving them damp but not dripping, ready for the dryer or air-drying.\n\n**In summary:**\n\nThe \"dripping a bit\" from your raincoat is a common observation for waterproof items after a wash. It indicates a less efficient water extraction for *that specific material*, not that the cleaning process was incomplete or that your clothes are still dirty.\n\nYou just need to give the raincoat extra time to dry, either by air-drying it or using a low-heat setting in a dryer if its care label allows."}
{"Question": "If a person sees a young woman she knows doing something haram with another boy (right infront of her eyes), does she have to tell the girls parents? Should she say nothing because she was the only one who saw?? --T--", "Answer": "Al-Salam alaykumIn such a case it is necessary that she fulfils her responsibility of stopping evil by doing what is in her capacity i.e. telling those who will be able to effect some reform viz. the girls parents. This will not be regarded as ghibah (backbiting) as the intention is to reform. [Faraz adds: Imam Abul Layth al-Samarqandi mentioned that things said out of genuine concern are not backbiting (ghiba), as in Sharhal-Tariqa al-Muhammadiyya and elsewhere", "Document": "Sa, id b. jubair reported that it was said to Ibn Abbas that Nauf al-Bikali was of the opinion that Moses who went in search of knowledge was not the Moses of Bani Israil. He said:Said, did you hear it from him? I said: Yes. Thereupon he said that Nauf had not stated the fact. Ubayy b. Kab narrated to us that he had heard Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: Moses had been delivering sermons to his people. And he made this remark: No person upon the earth has better knowledge than I or nothing better than mine. Thereupon Allah revealed to him: I know one who is better than you (in knowledge) or there is a person on the earth having more knowledge than you. Thereupon he said: My Lord, direct me to him. It was said to him: Keep a salted fish as a provision for journey. The place where that fish would be lost (there you will find that man). So he set forth and a young slave along with him until they came to a place Sakhra. but he did not find any clue. So he proceeded on and left that young man there. The fish began to stir in water and the water assumed the form of an ark over the fish. The young man said: I should meet Allahs Apostle (peace be upon him) and inform him, but he was made to forget and when they had gone beyond that place, he (Moses) said to the young man: Bring breakfast. We have been exhausted because of the journey, and he (Moses) was not exhausted until he had crossed that (particular) place (where he had) to meet Khadir, and the youth was reminded and said: Did you not see that as we reached Sakhra I forgot the fish and it is satan alone who has made me forgetful of it? It is strange that he has been able to find way in the ocean too. He said: This is what we sought for us. They returned retracing their steps, and he (his companion) pointed to him the location (where) the fish (had been lost). Moses began to search him there. He suddenly saw Khadir wrapped in a cloth and lying on his back. He said to him: As-Salamu-Alaikum. He removed the cloth from his face and said: Wa Alaikum-us-Salam! Who are you? He said: I am Moses. He said: Who Moses? He said: Moses Of Bani Israil. He said: What brought you here? He said: I have come so that you may teach me what you have been taught of righteousness. He said: You shall have to bear with me, and how can you have patience about a thing of which you have no comprehensive knowledge? You will not have patience when you see me doing a thing I have been ordered to do. He said: If Allah pleases, you will find me patient, nor shall I disobey you in aught. Khadir said: If you follow me, dont ask me about anything until I explain it to you. So they went on until they embarked upon a boat. He (Khadir) made a hole in that. Thereupon he (Moses) said: You have done this so that you may drown the persons sitting in the boat. You have done something grievous. Thereupon he said: Did I not tell you that you will not be able to bear with me? Thereupon he (Moses) said: Blame me not for what I forgot and be not hard upon me for what I did. (Khadir gave him another chance.) So they went on until they reached a place where boys were playing. He went to one of them and caught holdof one (apparently) at random and killed him. Moses (peace be upon him) felt agitated and said: You have killed an innocent person not guilty of slaying another. You have done something aboininable. Thereupon Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: May Allah have mercy upon us and Moses. Had he shown patience he would have seen wonderful things, but fear of blame, with respect to his companion, seized him and he said: If I ask anything after this, keep not company with me. You will then have a valid excuse in my case, and had he (Moses) shown patience he would have seen many wonderful things. He (the narrator) said: Whenever he (the Holy Prophet) made mention of any Prophet, he always said: May there be mercy of Allah upon us and upon my brother so and so. They, however, proceeded on until they came to the inhabitants of a village who were very miserly. They went to the meeting places and asked for hospitality but they refused to show any hospitality to them. They both found in that village a wall which was about to fall. He (Khadir) set it right. Thereupon he (Moses) said: If you so liked. you could get wages for it. Thereupon he said: This is the partince, of ways between me and you, and, taking hold of his cloth, he said: Now I will explain to you the real significance (of all these acts) for which you could not show patience. As for the boat, it belonged to the poor people working on the river and I intended to damage it for there was ahead of them (a king) who seized boats by force. (When he came) to catch hold of it he found it a damaged boat, so he spared it (and later on) it was set right with wood. So far as the boy is concerned, he has been, by very nature, an unbeliever, whereas his parents loved him very much. Had he grown up he would have involved them in wrongdoing and unbelief, so we wished that their Lord should give them in its place one better in purity and close to mercy. And as for the wall it belonged to two orphan boys in the city and there was beneath it a (treasure) belongin to them,... up to the last verse. This hadith has been transmitted on the authority of Abu Ishaq.<D>Narrated Aisha:(The wife of the Prophet) Whenever Allahs Apostle intended to go on a journey, he used to draw lots among his wives and would take with him the one on whom the lot had fallen. Once he drew lots when he wanted to carry out a Ghazwa, and the lot came upon me. So I proceeded with Allahs Apostle after Allahs order of veiling (the women) had been revealed and thus I was carried in my howdah (on a camel) and dismounted while still in it. We carried on our journey, and when Allahs Apostle had finished his Ghazwa and returned and we approached Medina, Allahs Apostle ordered to proceed at night. When the army was ordered to resume the homeward journey, I got up and walked on till I left the army (camp) behind. When I had answered the call of nature, I went towards my howdah, but behold ! A necklace of mine made of Jaz Azfar (a kind of black bead) was broken and I looked for it and my search for it detained me. The group of people who used to carry me, came and carried my howdah on to the back of my camel on which I was riding, considering that I was therein. At that time women were light in weight and were not fleshy for they used to eat little (food), so those people did not feel the lightness of the howdah while raising it up, and I was still a young lady. They drove away the camel and proceeded. Then I found my necklace after the army had gone. I came to their camp but found nobody therein so I went to the place where I used to stay, thinking that they would miss me and come back in my search. While I was sitting at my place, I felt sleepy and slept. Safwan bin Al-Muattil As-Sulami Adh- Dhakw-ani was behind the army. He had started in the last part of the night and reached my stationing place in the morning and saw the figure of a sleeping person. He came to me and recognized me on seeing me for he used to see me before veiling. I got up because of his saying: \"Inna Li l-lahi wa inna ilaihi rajiun,\" which he uttered on recognizing me. I covered my face with my garment, and by Allah, he did not say to me a single word except, \"Inna Li l-lahi wa inna ilaihi rajiun,\" till he made his shecamel kneel down whereupon he trod on its forelegs and I mounted it. Then Safwan set out, leading the she-camel that was carrying me, till we met the army while they were resting during the hot midday. Then whoever was meant for destruction, fell in destruction, and the leader of the Ifk (forged statement) was `Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul. After this we arrived at Medina and I became ill for one month while the people were spreading the forged statements of the people of the Ifk, and I was not aware of anything thereof. But what aroused my doubt while I was sick, was that I was no longer receiving from Allahs Apostle the same kindness as I used to receive when I fell sick. Allahs Apostle would enter upon me, say a greeting and add, \"How is that (lady)?\" and then depart. That aroused my suspicion but I was not aware of the propagated evil till I recovered from my ailment. I went out with Um Mistah to answer the call of nature towards Al-Manasi, the place where we used to relieve ourselves, and used not to go out for this purpose except from night to night, and that was before we had lavatories close to our houses. And this habit of ours was similar to the habit of the old Arabs (in the deserts or in the tents) concerning the evacuation of the bowels, for we considered it troublesome and harmful to take lavatories in the houses. So I went out with Um Mistah who was the daughter of Abi Ruhm bin `Abd Manaf, and her mother was daughter of Sakhr bin Amir who was the aunt of Abi Bakr As-Siddiq, and her son was Mistah bin Uthatha. When we had finished our affair, Um Mistah and I came back towards my house. Um Mistah stumbled over her robe whereupon she said, \"Let Mistah be ruined ! \" I said to her, \"What a bad word you have said! Do you abuse a man who has taken part in the Battle of Badr? She said, \"O you there! Didnt you hear what he has said?\" I said, \"And what did he say?\" She then told me the statement of the people of the Ifk (forged statement) which added to my ailment. When I returned home, Allahs Apostle came to me, and after greeting, he said, \"How is that (lady)?\" I said, \"Will you allow me to go to my parents?\" At that time I intended to be sure of the news through them. Allahs Apostle allowed me and I went to my parents and asked my mother, \"O my mother! What are the people talking about?\" My mother said, \"O my daughter! Take it easy, for by Allah, there is no charming lady who is loved by her husband who has other wives as well, but that those wives would find fault with her.\" I said, \"Subhan Allah! Did the people really talk about that?\" That night I kept on weeping the whole night till the morning. My tears never stopped, nor did I sleep, and morning broke while I was still weeping, Allahs Apostle called `Ali bin Abi Talib and Usama bin Zaid when the Divine Inspiration delayed, in order to consult them as to the idea of divorcing his wife. Usama bin Zaid told Allahs Apostle of what he knew about the innocence of his wife and of his affection he kept for her. He said, \"O Allahs Apostle! She is your wife, and we do not know anything about her except good.\" But `Ali bin Abi Talib said, \"O Allahs Apostle! Allah does not impose restrictions on you; and there are plenty of women other than her. If you however, ask (her) slave girl, she will tell you the truth.\" `Aisha added: So Allahs Apostle called for Barira and said, \"O Barira! Did you ever see anything which might have aroused your suspicion? (as regards Aisha). Barira said, \"By Allah Who has sent you with the truth, I have never seen anything regarding Aisha which I would blame her for except that she is a girl of immature age who sometimes sleeps and leaves the dough of her family unprotected so that the domestic goats come and eat it.\" So Allahs Apostle got up (and addressed) the people an asked for somebody who would take revenge on `Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul then. Allahs Apostle, while on the pulpit, said, \"O Muslims! Who will help me against a man who has hurt me by slandering my family? By Allah, I know nothing except good about my family, and people have blamed a man of whom I know nothing except good, and he never used to visit my family except with me,\" Sa`d bin Mu`adh Al-Ansari got up and said, \"O Allahs Apostle! By Allah, I will relieve you from him. If he be from the tribe of (Bani) Al-Aus, then I will chop his head off; and if he be from our brethren, the Khazraj, then you give us your order and we will obey it.\" On that, Sa`d bin Ubada got up, and he was the chief of the Khazraj, and before this incident he had been a pious man but he was incited by his zeal for his tribe. He said to Sa`d (bin Mu`adh), \"By Allah the Eternal, you have told a lie! You shall not kill him and you will never be able to kill him!\" On that, Usaid bin Hudair, the cousin of Sa`d (bin Mu`adh) got up and said to Sa`d bin Ubada, \"You are a liar! By Allah the Eternal, we will surely kill him; and you are a hypocrite defending the hypocrites!\" So the two tribes of Al-Aus and Al-Khazraj got excited till they were on the point of fighting with each other while Allahs Apostle was standing on the pulpit. Allahs Apostle continued quietening them till they became silent whereupon he became silent too. On that day I kept on weeping so much that neither did my tears stop, nor could I sleep. In the morning my parents were with me, and I had wept for two nights and a day without sleeping and with incessant tears till they thought that my liver would burst with weeping. While they were with me and I was weeping, an Ansari woman asked permission to see me. I admitted her and she sat and started weeping with me. While I was in that state, Allahs Apostle came to us, greeted, and sat down,. He had never sat with me since the day what was said, was said. He had stayed a month without receiving any Divine Inspiration concerning my case. Allahs Apostle recited the Tashahhud after he had sat down, and then said, \"Thereafter, O `Aisha! I have been informed such and-such a thing about you; and if you are innocent, Allah will reveal your innocence, and if you have committed a sin, then ask for Allahs forgiveness and repent to Him, for when a slave confesses his sin and then repents to Allah, Allah accepts his repentance.\" When Allahs Apostle had finished his speech, my tears ceased completely so that I no longer felt even a drop thereof. Then I said to my father, \"Reply to Allahs Apostle on my behalf as to what he said.\" He said, \"By Allah, I do not know what to say to Allahs Apostle.\" Then I said to my mother, \"Reply to Allahs Apostle.\" She said, \"I do not know what to say to Allahs Apostle.\" Still a young girl as I was and though I had little knowledge of Quran, I said, \"By Allah, I know that you heard this story (of the Ifk) so much so that it has been planted in your minds and you have believed it. So now, if I tell you that I am innocent, and Allah knows that I am innocent, you will not believe me; and if I confess something, and Allah knows that I am innocent of it, you will believe me. By Allah, I cannot find of you an example except that of Josephs father: \"So (for me) patience is most fitting against that which you assert and it is Allah (Alone) Whose help can be sought. Then I turned away and lay on my bed, and at that time I knew that I was innocent and that Allah would reveal my innocence. But by Allah, I never thought that Allah would sent down about my affair, Divine Inspiration that would be recited (forever), as I considered myself too unworthy to be talked of by Allah with something that was to be recited: but I hoped that Allahs Apostle might have a vision in which Allah would prove my innocence. By Allah, Allahs Apostle had not left his seat and nobody had left the house when the Divine Inspiration came to Allahs Apostle . So there overtook him the same hard condition which used to overtake him (when he was Divinely Inspired) so that the drops of his sweat were running down, like pearls, though it was a (cold) winter day, and that was because of the heaviness of the Statement which was revealed to him. When that state of Allahs Apostle was over, and he was smiling when he was relieved, the first word he said was, \"Aisha, Allah has declared your innocence.\" My mother said to me, \"Get up and go to him.\" I said, \"By Allah, I will not go to him and I will not thank anybody but Allah.\" So Allah revealed: \"Verily! They who spread the Slander are a gang among you. Think it not....\" (24.11-20). When Allah revealed this to confirm my innocence, Abu Bakr As-Siddiq who used to provide for Mistah bin Uthatha because of the latters kinship to him and his poverty, said, \"By Allah, I will never provide for Mistah anything after what he has said about Aisha\". So Allah revealed: (continued...) (continuing... 1): -6.274:... ... \"Let not those among you who are good and are wealthy swear not to give (help) to their kinsmen, those in need, and those who have left their homes for Allahs Cause. Let them Pardon and forgive (i.e. do not punish them). Do you not love that should forgive you? Verily Allah is Oft-forgiving. Most Merciful.\" (24.22) Abu Bakr said, \"Yes, by Allah, I wish that Allah should forgive me.\" So he resumed giving Mistah the aid he used to give him before and said, \"By Allah, I will never withold it from him at all.\" Aisha further said: Allahs Apostle also asked Zainab bint Jahsh about my case. He said, \"O Zainab! What have you seen?\" She replied, \"O Allahs Apostle! I protect my hearing and my sight (by refraining from telling lies). I know nothing but good (about Aisha).\" Of all the wives of Allahs Apostle, it was Zainab who aspired to receive from him the same favor as I used to receive, yet, Allah saved her (from telling lies) because of her piety. But her sister, Hamna, kept on fighting on her behalf so she was destroyed as were those who invented and spread the slander.<D>Narrated Aisha:(the wife of the Prophet) \"Whenever Allahs Apostle intended to go on a journey, he would draw lots amongst his wives and would take with him the one upon whom the lot fell. During a Ghazwa of his, he drew lots amongst us and the lot fell upon me, and I proceeded with him after Allah had decreed the use of the veil by women. I was carried in a Howdah (on the camel) and dismounted while still in it. When Allahs Apostle was through with his Ghazwa and returned home, and we approached the city of Medina, Allahs Apostle ordered us to proceed at night. When the order of setting off was given, I walked till I was past the army to answer the call of nature. After finishing I returned (to the camp) to depart (with the others) and suddenly realized that my necklace over my chest was missing. So, I returned to look for it and was delayed because of that. The people who used to carry me on the camel, came to my Howdah and put it on the back of the camel, thinking that I was in it, as, at that time, women were light in weight, and thin and lean, and did not use to eat much. So, those people did not feel the difference in the heaviness of the Howdah while lifting it, and they put it over the camel. At that time I was a young lady. They set the camel moving and proceeded on. I found my necklace after the army had gone, and came to their camp to find nobody. So, I went to the place where I used to stay, thinking that they would discover my absence and come back in my search. While in that state, I felt sleepy and slept. Safwan bin Muattal As-Sulami Adh-Dhakwani was behind the army and reached my abode in the morning. When he saw a sleeping person, he came to me, and he used to see me before veiling. So, I got up when I heard him saying, \"Inna lil-lah-wa inn a ilaihi rajiun (We are for Allah, and we will return to Him).\" He made his camel knell down. He got down from his camel, and put his leg on the front legs of the camel and then I rode and sat over it. Safwan set out walking, leading the camel by the rope till we reached the army who had halted to take rest at midday. Then whoever was meant for destruction, fell into destruction, (some people accused me falsely) and the leader of the false accusers was `Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul. After that we returned to Medina, and I became ill for one month while the people were spreading the forged statements of the false accusers. I was feeling during my ailment as if I were not receiving the usual kindness from the Prophet which I used to receive from him when I got sick. But he would come, greet and say, How is that (girl)? I did not know anything of what was going on till I recovered from my ailment and went out with Um Mistah to the Manasi where we used to answer the call of nature, and we used not to go to answer the call of nature except from night to night and that was before we had lavatories near to our houses. And this habit of ours was similar to the habit of the old Arabs in the open country (or away from houses). So. I and Um Mistah bint Ruhm went out walking. Um Mistah stumbled because of her long dress and on that she said, Let Mistah be ruined. I said, You are saying a bad word. Why are you abusing a man who took part in (the battle of) Badr? She said, O Hanata (you there) didnt you hear what they said? Then she told me the rumors of the false accusers. My sickness was aggravated, and when I returned home, Allahs Apostle came to me, and after greeting he said, How is that (girl)? I requested him to allow me to go to my parents. I wanted then to be sure of the news through them I Allahs Apostle allowed me, and I went to my parents and asked my mother, What are the people talking about? She said, O my daughter! Dont worry much about this matter. By Allah, never is there a charming woman loved by her husband who has other wives, but the women would forge false news about her. I said, Glorified be Allah! Are the people really taking of this matter? That night I kept on weeping and could not sleep till morning. In the morning Allahs Apostle called `Ali bin Abu Talib and Usama bin Zaid when he saw the Divine Inspiration delayed, to consul them about divorcing his wife (i.e. `Aisha). Usama bin Zaid said what he knew of the good reputation of his wives and added, O Allahs Apostle! Keep you wife, for, by Allah, we know nothing about her but good. `Ali bin Abu Talib said, O Allahs Apostle! Allah has no imposed restrictions on you, and there are many women other than she, yet you may ask the woman-servant who will tell you the truth. On that Allahs Apostle called Buraira and said, O Burair. Did you ever see anything which roused your suspicions about her? Buraira said, No, by Allah Who has sent you with the Truth, I have never seen in her anything faulty except that she is a girl of immature age, who sometimes sleeps and leaves the dough for the goats to eat. On that day Allahs Apostle ascended the pulpit and requested that somebody support him in punishing `Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul. Allahs Apostle said, Who will support me to punish that person (`Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul) who has hurt me by slandering the reputation of my family? By Allah, I know nothing about my family but good, and they have accused a person about whom I know nothing except good, and he never entered my house except in my company. Sa`d bin Mu`adh got up and said, O Allahs Apostle! by Allah, I will relieve you from him. If that man is from the tribe of the Aus, then we will chop his head off, and if he is from our brothers, the Khazraj, then order us, and we will fulfill your order. On that Sa`d bin Ubada, the chief of the Khazraj and before this incident, he had been a pious man, got up, motivated by his zeal for his tribe and said, By Allah, you have told a lie; you cannot kill him, and you will never be able to kill him. On that Usaid bin Al-Hadir got up and said (to Sa`d bin Ubada), By Allah! you are a liar. By Allah, we will kill him; and you are a hypocrite, defending the hypocrites. On this the two tribes of Aus and Khazraj got excited and were about to fight each other, while Allahs Apostle was standing on the pulpit. He got down and quieted them till they became silent and he kept quiet. On that day I kept on weeping so much so that neither did my tears stop, nor could I sleep. In the morning my parents were with me and I had wept for two nights and a day, till I thought my liver would burst from weeping. While they were sitting with me and I was weeping, an Ansari woman asked my permission to enter, and I allowed her to come in. She sat down and started weeping with me. While we were in this state, Allahs Apostle came and sat down and he had never sat with me since the day they forged the accusation. No revelation regarding my case came to him for a month. He recited Tashah-hud (i.e. None has the right to be worshipped but Allah and Muhammad is His Apostle) and then said, O `Aisha! I have been informed such-and-such about you; if you are innocent, then Allah will soon reveal your innocence, and if you have committed a sin, then repent to Allah and ask Him to forgive you, for when a person confesses his sin and asks Allah for forgiveness, Allah accepts his repentance. When Allahs Apostle finished his speech my tears ceased completely and there remained not even a single drop of it. I requested my father to reply to Allahs Apostle on my behalf. My father said, By Allah, I do not know what to say to Allahs Apostle. I said to my mother, Talk to Allahs Apostle on my behalf. She said, By Allah, I do not know what to say to Allahs Apostle. I was a young girl and did not have much knowledge of the Quran. I said. I know, by Allah, that you have listened to what people are saying and that has been planted in your minds and you have taken it as a truth. Now, if I told you that I am innocent and Allah knows that I am innocent, you would not believe me and if I confessed to you falsely that I am guilty, and Allah knows that I am innocent you would believe me. By Allah, I dont compare my situation with you except to the situation of Josephs father (i.e. Jacob) who said, So (for me) patience is most fitting against that which you assert and it is Allah (Alone) whose help can be sought. Then I turned to the other side of my bed hoping that Allah would prove my innocence. By Allah I never thought that Allah would reveal Divine Inspiration in my case, as I considered myself too inferior to be talked of in the Holy Quran. I had hoped that Allahs Apostle might have a dream in which Allah would prove my innocence. By Allah, Allahs Apostle had not got up and nobody had left the house before the Divine Inspiration came to Allahs Apostle. So, there overtook him the same state which used to overtake him, (when he used to have, on being inspired divinely). He was sweating so much so that the drops of the sweat were dropping like pearls though it was a (cold) wintry day. When that state of Allahs Apostle was over, he was smiling and the first word he said, `Aisha! Thank Allah, for Allah has declared your innocence. My mother told me to go to Allahs Apostle . I replied, By Allah I will not go to him and will not thank but Allah. So Allah revealed: \"Verily! They who spread the slander are a gang among you . . .\" (24.11) When Allah gave the declaration of my Innocence, Abu Bakr, who used to provide for Mistah bin Uthatha for he was his relative, said, By Allah, I will never provide Mistah with anything because of what he said about Aisha. But Allah later revealed: -- \"And let not those who are good and wealthy among you swear not to help their kinsmen, those in need and those who left their homes in Allahs Cause. Let them forgive and overlook. Do you not wish that Allah should forgive you? Verily! Allah is Oft-forgiving, Most Merciful.\" (24.22) After that Abu Bakr said, Yes ! By Allah! I like that Allah should forgive me, and resumed helping Mistah whom he used to help before. Allahs Apostle also asked Zainab bint Jahsh (i.e. the Prophets wife about me saying, What do you know and what did you see? She replied, O Allahs Apostle! I refrain to claim hearing or seeing what I have not heard or seen. By Allah, I know nothing except goodness about Aisha.\" Aisha further added \"Zainab was competing with me (in her beauty and the Prophets love), yet Allah protected her (from being malicious), for she had piety.\"<D>(And if ye wish to exchange one wife for another) He says: If you wish to marry a woman and divorce one you are already married to, or marry a woman in addition to the one you are already married to (and ye have given unto one of them a sum of money (however great)) a dowry, (take nothing from it) from the dowry. (Would ye take it) the dowry (by the way of calumny) as an unlawful possession (and open wrong?) a clear transgression.<D>(And if ye fear) if you know (a breech between them twain (the man and wife)) a dispute between the man and woman and you cannot establish who is at fault, (appoint an arbiter from his folk) from the mans folk to the man so that he can hear what he has to say and therefore establish whether he is in the right or wrong (and an arbiter from her folk) from the womans folk to the woman in order to hear what she has to say and therefore establish whether she is in the right or wrong. (If they) the arbiters (desire amendment) between the man and the woman, (Allah will make them of one mind) i.e. the arbiters, the man and thewoman. (Lo! Allah is ever Knower) of the agreement and disagreement of the arbiters, (Aware) of the doingof the woman and the man. The verses from Allahs saying: (Men are in charge of women, because Allah hath made the one of them to excel the other) to His saying: (If they desire amendment Allah will make them of one mind. Lo! Allah is ever Knower, Aware) were revealed about the daughter of Muhammad Ibn Salamah. Her husband, Asad Ibn al-Rabi had slapped her because she refused to sleep with him. Consequently, she went to the Prophet (pbuh) to seek retaliation against her husband, but Allah prohibited her from doing so.<D>(But if they separate) i.e. the man and the woman through divorce, (Allah will compensate each) the man and the woman (out of His abundance) from His provision: the man will be compensated with another wife and the woman with another husband. (Allah is ever All-Embracing) in relation to them as regards marriage,(All-Knowing) of that which He prescribed for them of justice. Asad Ibn al-Rabi had another young wife whom he favoured, and Allah forbade him from doing so and commanded that the young and the old wives were treated equally.", "Generated_Answer": "This is a delicate situation that requires wisdom and careful consideration of Islamic principles.\n\nIn Islam, there is a strong emphasis on **sitr** (covering the faults of others) and not exposing someone's private sins. The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) said, \"Whoever covers the fault of a Muslim, Allah will cover his fault in this world and in the Hereafter.\" (Sahih Muslim)\n\nHowever, this principle of covering faults is balanced with the duty of **enjoining good and forbidding evil** (Amr bil Ma'ruf wa Nahi anil Munkar) and protecting individuals from harm, especially those who might be vulnerable.\n\nHere's a breakdown of how to approach this, considering different factors:\n\n**1. The Primary Approach: Private Advice (Naseeha)**\n\n*   **First and foremost, the recommended action is to approach the young woman herself, privately and gently.**\n    *   Explain what you saw in a non-judgmental, compassionate way.\n    *   Remind her of Allah, the seriousness of the act, and the potential consequences in this life and the Hereafter.\n    *   Encourage her to repent sincerely and to distance herself from such actions and relationships.\n    *   Emphasize that you are telling her out of concern for her well-being and her hereafter, not to expose or shame her.\n    *   Give her a chance to reflect and change her behavior.\n\n**2. When Informing Parents Might Be Considered (As a Last Resort, and With Conditions):**\n\nTelling the parents should generally be a last resort and considered only if:\n\n*   **The \"haram\" act is extremely serious and ongoing:** If it's something like zina (unlawful sexual activity), drug use, running away, or something that puts her in grave danger (physical or spiritual), and it's not a one-off mistake but a persistent pattern.\n*   **The girl refused to change after private advice:** If you've approached her privately, and she shows no remorse, denies it, or indicates she will continue the behavior, then further action might be necessary.\n*   **There is an imminent danger to her well-being:** If you genuinely fear for her safety, reputation, or future if this behavior continues unchecked, and she is unable or unwilling to stop it herself.\n*   **The parents are likely to handle it wisely and constructively:** This is a crucial point. If you believe the parents are likely to react with extreme anger, abuse, or public shaming that could cause more harm than good, then telling them might not be the best option. Your intention should be her protection and guidance, not her punishment.\n\n**How to inform parents (if you decide it's necessary):**\n\n*   **Discreetly and Privately:** Never gossip or spread the information publicly.\n*   **Focus on Concern, Not Accusation:** Frame it from a place of genuine concern for their daughter's well-being and future, rather than just accusing her.\n*   **Suggest Solutions/Support:** Instead of just dropping the news, you might say something like, \"I'm concerned about [daughter's name] and saw something that worried me. I wanted to bring it to your attention so you can guide and protect her.\"\n*   **Pray for Guidance:** Ask Allah to guide you to the best course of action and to rectify the situation for the young woman and her family.\n\n**Why \"say nothing because she was the only one who saw\" is often the preferred initial choice:**\n\n*   **Preserving Modesty and Dignity:** Islam values preserving a person's dignity and not exposing their private sins.\n*   **Opportunity for Repentance:** It allows the person to repent sincerely to Allah without public humiliation. Allah is the Most Forgiving, and He loves those who turn to Him in repentance.\n*   **Avoiding Fitna (Discord):** Exposing such matters can lead to severe family conflicts, trust issues, and wider societal problems.\n\n**In summary:**\n\n1.  **Prioritize private advice (naseeha) to the girl herself, with kindness and wisdom.** This is almost always the first and best step.\n2.  **Only consider informing parents if:**\n    *   The act is very serious and ongoing.\n    *   The girl has not responded to private advice.\n    *   You genuinely fear for her well-being.\n    *   You believe the parents will handle it in a constructive, protective way, not abusively.\n3.  **If you do inform parents, do so privately, out of sincere concern, and without malice.**\n\nIt's a heavy responsibility, and it's always advisable to consult with a trusted, knowledgeable Islamic scholar or elder if you are unsure, as they can provide guidance based on the specifics of your situation."}

Let's break it down:\n\n1.  **The Requirement for Purification from Najasah:**\n    In Islamic jurisprudence, for something to be considered pure from ritual impurity (*najasah* like urine, blood, faeces, etc.), it generally needs to be washed with water. The method of washing usually involves water passing over or through the impure area until the impurity's trace (colour, smell, or taste, if applicable) is removed.\n\n2.  **Washing vs. Dry Cleaning:**\n    *   **Washing:** Involves water, detergent, and agitation, followed by rinsing. This process effectively removes physical impurities and purifies the item according to Islamic requirements.\n    *   **Dry Cleaning:** Uses chemical solvents instead of water. While it cleans clothes and removes stains, it does *not* involve water in the way required for ritual purification from *najasah*. Therefore, if clothes had *najasah* on them and were only dry-cleaned, they would generally still be considered impure in the Islamic sense.\n\n3.  **Addressing Your Doubt:**\n    *   **The Default Assumption (Asl):** When you give clothes to a laundry and specifically ask them to \"wash,\" the default assumption (*asl*) is that they will use water. Laundries commonly understand \"washing\" to mean a water-based process unless \"dry cleaning\" is explicitly requested.\n    *   **Dealing with Doubt (*Waswasa*):** In Islam, one should not act solely on baseless doubts, especially if it leads to excessive worry (*waswasa*). Since you instructed them to \"wash,\" you should assume they followed your instructions.\n\n**What to Do:**\n\n1.  **Assume they Washed:** Unless you have strong evidence or a clear indication that they dry-cleaned it (e.g., they told you, or the smell is distinctly that of dry-cleaning chemicals and not detergent), you should assume they washed the clothes with water as per your instruction. The principle is that certainty is not removed by doubt. You were certain you asked for washing.\n2.  **If You Have Strong Suspicion or Evidence:**\n    *   **Contact the Laundry:** The easiest and most definitive way to resolve your doubt is to simply call the laundry and ask them directly: \"I gave you these clothes (describe them) and asked for washing. Can you confirm they were washed with water, or were they dry-cleaned?\"\n    *   **If they confirm dry-cleaning:** If they tell you definitively that they dry-cleaned the clothes, and you know for sure the clothes had *najasah* on them previously, then you would need to wash those clothes with water yourself to ensure their purity before using them for prayer or in situations where purity is required.\n    *   **If they confirm washing or are unsure:** If they confirm they washed them, or if they are unsure but you requested washing, then the clothes are considered pure.\n\n**In summary:** Since you specifically asked for \"washing,\" the default assumption is that they washed them with water. Unless you have strong evidence to the contrary, you are not obligated to re-wash them. Do not let doubt consume you. If you are genuinely concerned, a quick phone call to the laundry can clarify the matter."}
{"Question": "Synthetic Alcohol is not najis ? --T--", "Answer": "In the Name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful, and all blessings and peace upon our master Muhammad, his Folk, Companions and those who follow their noble way,Assalamu alaikum,According to the Indian Hanafi scholars, the fatwa in our times is that synthetic alcohols (and all alcohol not considered khamr) is tahir, and permitted to use and consume AS LONG AS:(a) it is not used as an intoxicant;(b) it is not used as intoxicants as used (i.e. for alcoholic consumption, even a little);(c) it is not used in an amount that intoxicates;(d) it is not used in vain (lahw).This was Mufti Mahmoud Ashraf Usmanis explanation, and it is supported by many fatwas in the great Indian Hanafi fatwa references of the 20th Century. This is the position of Imam Abu Hanifa himself. Later scholars said that the fatwa was on the position of Imam Muhammad ibn al-Hasan al-Shaybani, Abu Hanifas student, that all alcohol is najis and haram, even in small quantities, because of widespread fitna. In our times, because of the widespread use of alcohol in all sorts of things, it has become very difficult to avoid. This is why great Hanafis of our times gave the abovementioned fatwa.Wassalam,Faraz Rabbani", "Document": "Narrated `Aisha:When the last verses of Surat-al-Baqara were revealed, the Prophet went out (of his house to the Mosque) and said, \"The trade of alcohol has become illegal.\"<D>Narrated Jabir bin `Abdullah:\"Some people drank alcohol in the morning of the day (of the battle) of Uhud and were martyred (on the same day).\" Sufyan was asked, \"(Were they martyred) in the last part of the day?)\" He replied, \"Such information does not occur in the narration.\"<D>Narrated Aisha:When the last Verses of Surat al- Baqara were revealed, the Prophet recited them in the mosque and proclaimed the trade of alcohol as illegal.", "Generated_Answer": "This is a nuanced question in Islamic jurisprudence (Fiqh), and the answer depends on how \"synthetic alcohol\" is defined and which scholarly opinion one follows regarding the impurity (najasa) of alcohol in general.\n\nHere's a breakdown:\n\n1.  **The Nature of Alcohol (Khamr) in Islam:**\n    *   **Prohibition (Haram):** There is a consensus among Muslim scholars that *khamr* (intoxicating drinks) is *haram* (forbidden) to consume. This is based on clear verses in the Quran and prophetic traditions. The prohibition is due to its intoxicating effect, which corrupts the mind and leads to sin.\n    *   **Impurity (Najasa):** This is where the debate lies.\n        *   **Majority Opinion:** The classical majority of Sunni scholars (from the Hanafi, Shafi'i, Maliki, and Hanbali schools) consider *khamr* (intoxicating wine and by extension, other intoxicants) to be *najis* (physically impure) in the same way that urine, feces, or blood are impure. They base this on the Quranic verse that refers to *khamr* as \"Rijsun min 'amalish shaytan\" (an abomination/impurity of Satan's handiwork - Quran 5:90). \"Rijs\" is interpreted as both spiritual and physical impurity. According to this view, if it touches the body or clothes, it must be washed for prayer.\n        *   **Minority/Later Scholars' Opinion:** Some scholars, including prominent figures like Ibn Taymiyyah and many contemporary scholars (like Sheikh Uthaymeen, Sheikh Qaradawi, etc.), argue that while *khamr* is *haram* (forbidden) to consume, it is *not* physically *najis*. They interpret \"Rijsun\" in the verse as spiritual impurity (like idols or gambling) rather than physical impurity. They point out that the Prophet's companions did not receive specific instructions to wash clothes or utensils that had come into contact with alcohol after its prohibition, implying it wasn't considered physically impure like other defilements.\n\n2.  **Applying to \"Synthetic Alcohol\":**\n\n    *   **If \"Synthetic Alcohol\" is an Intoxicant:**\n        If \"synthetic alcohol\" refers to ethanol (which is intoxicating) produced chemically rather than through natural fermentation, and it is intended for consumption as an intoxicant, then it falls under the ruling of *khamr*. Therefore:\n        *   It is *haram* to consume.\n        *   Whether it is *najis* depends on which of the two scholarly opinions (majority vs. minority) on the *najasa* of *khamr* you follow.\n\n    *   **If \"Synthetic Alcohol\" is in Non-Consumable Products:**\n        This is where the distinction becomes crucial. Most \"synthetic alcohols\" encountered daily are ethanol used in products like:\n        *   **Hand Sanitizers:** Contains ethanol for disinfection.\n        *   **Perfumes/Colognes:** Often contains ethanol as a solvent.\n        *   **Medicines:** Some liquid medications use alcohol as a solvent or preservative.\n        *   **Industrial Solvents/Cleaners:** Not for human consumption.\n\n        For these uses, the vast majority of scholars, even those who consider consumable *khamr* to be *najis*, agree that these products are **not considered najis and are permissible for external use.** The reasons include:\n        *   **Purpose:** The alcohol is not intended for intoxication or consumption. Its purpose is for disinfection, scent, preservation, etc.\n        *   **Transformation (Istihala):** Some argue that the alcohol, when mixed with other substances in these products, undergoes a transformation (istihala) that changes its nature from an intoxicant to a non-intoxicant substance for external use.\n        *   **Necessity and Public Benefit:** There's a general Islamic principle of ease and avoiding undue hardship, especially for things that are widespread and beneficial in daily life.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n*   **Consuming any form of intoxicating alcohol (natural or synthetic) is *haram* (forbidden).**\n*   **Regarding its *najasa* (physical impurity), there are two main views:**\n    *   **Majority:** Yes, it is physically *najis*.\n    *   **Minority/Contemporary:** No, it is not physically *najis* (though still forbidden to consume).\n*   **For \"synthetic alcohol\" used in non-consumable products like sanitizers, perfumes, or medicines, the general consensus among contemporary scholars is that it is NOT considered najis and is permissible for external use.** You can pray with clothes that have perfume or hand sanitizer on them.\n\nTherefore, for the common understanding of \"synthetic alcohol\" used in perfumes, sanitizers, etc., the answer is generally **no, it is not considered najis** by the prevailing view on its external application. However, if one were to drink it for intoxication, then the rules of *haram* apply, and its *najasa* would depend on the differing scholarly opinions."}

A true hypocrite wouldn't feel this internal conflict or worry about the acceptance of their deeds. This feeling you're experiencing is often a whisper from Shaytan (Satan) to discourage you from doing good, or it's the natural human struggle against *riya* (showing off) and *ujub* (self-admiration), which are subtle diseases of the heart.\n\nLet's address your questions:\n\n---\n\n### 1. Can Your Deeds Still Be Accepted?\n\n**Yes, absolutely, Insha'Allah (God willing)!**\n\nHere's why:\n\n*   **Your Awareness is Key:** The very fact that you are questioning your intentions and feeling this internal struggle means you are fighting *against* riya, not succumbing to it. This struggle itself is an act of worship and a sign of a living heart. Allah rewards sincere effort and struggle.\n*   **Allah Knows What's in the Hearts:** Allah (SWT) knows the secrets of the hearts. He sees your inner battle, your desire for sincerity, and your discomfort with the whispers of ego or desire for praise. If your primary intention is truly for Him, and these other thoughts are fleeting whispers or a battle you're engaged in, He is All-Merciful and All-Forgiving.\n*   **Mixed Intentions:** It's rare for intentions to be 100% pure all the time for most people. What matters is the *dominant* intention. If the dominant intention is for Allah, but a whisper of riya comes, you acknowledge it, seek refuge from it, and push it away. This act of pushing it away for Allah's sake is itself rewarded.\n*   **Minor Shirk (Shirk al-Asghar):** Riya is considered minor shirk (associating partners with Allah in a minor way, in this case, seeking praise from others alongside Allah's pleasure). While serious, it's not the major shirk that takes one out of Islam. The Prophet (PBUH) taught us to seek refuge from it, acknowledging its subtle nature.\n    *   *Umar ibn Al-Khattab (RA) said, \"The one who thinks he is humble is arrogant. The one who thinks he is knowledgeable is ignorant.\" This highlights the subtlety of these internal diseases.*\n\nDo not let these feelings paralyze you or stop you from doing good deeds. Continue doing them, continue striving for sincerity, and continue seeking Allah's acceptance.\n\n---\n\n### 2.

Understanding the Nature of Riya:**\n\n1.  **Riya is Minor Shirk:** The Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) said: \"The thing I fear most for you is minor shirk.\" When asked about it, he said, \"It is Ar-Riya (showing off).\" (Ahmad)\n2.  **It Destroys Deeds:** Acts performed primarily for showing off to people will lose their reward in the Hereafter. Allah is Self-Sufficient and does not need partners in worship.\n3.  **It's Subtle:** Riya can be like a black ant on a black stone in a dark night – hard to see. It can manifest even after the deed is done (e.g., feeling pleased when someone praises you, or disappointed if they don't notice).\n\n**B. Practical Cures and Strategies:**\n\n1.  **Constant Self-Reflection (Muhasabah):**\n    *   **Before the Deed:** Ask yourself: \"Why am I doing this? Is it purely for Allah's pleasure?\"\n    *   **During the Deed:** If a thought of showing off creeps in, immediately renew your intention: \"I am doing this for You, Allah.\" Seek refuge in Allah from Shaytan.\n    *   **After the Deed:** Reflect: \"Did I feel pleased if someone praised me? Did I feel disappointed if no one noticed? Was my heart truly aligned with Allah?\" If you detect riya, immediately seek forgiveness (Istighfar).\n\n2.  **Renew Your Intention (Tajdeed an-Niyyah):** Make it a conscious practice to remind yourself, \"I am doing this *for Allah*,\" before and during every act of worship or good deed.\n\n3.  **Focus Solely on Allah:**\n    *   **Allah is the Only Observer Who Matters:** Remind yourself that only Allah's view matters. People's praise or criticism is temporary and worthless in the long run.\n    *   **Remember the Day of Judgment:** On that day, only deeds done with pure intention for Allah will benefit you. People's opinions won't count.\n    *   **Allah's Rewards vs. Human Praise:** Allah's reward is eternal Jannah (Paradise); human praise is fleeting and often insincere. Which is more valuable?\n\n4.  **Conceal Good Deeds (When Possible):**\n    *   The Prophet (PBUH) and the Salaf (early pious generations) often strove to hide their good deeds, even their night prayers and charity, to ensure sincerity.\n    *   While some deeds are public (like congregational prayer), others, like voluntary charity, extra Qur'an recitation, or helping someone, can often be done in private. The more you hide, the purer your intention becomes.\n\n5.  **Dua (Supplication):** This is one of the most powerful tools.\n    *   Constantly make this Du'a taught by the Prophet (PBUH):\n        **\"Allahumma inni a'udhu bika an ushrika bika wa ana a'lam, wa astaghfiruka lima la a'lam.\"**\n        (O Allah, I seek refuge in You from associating anything with You knowingly, and I seek Your forgiveness for what I do not know.)\n    *   Pray specifically for sincerity (Ikhlas) in all your deeds.\n    *   Pray for humility and protection from self-admiration (ujub).\n\n6.  **Seek Knowledge:** Learn more about sincerity, riya, and the attributes of Allah. The more you know Allah, the more you will desire to please Him alone.\n\n7.  **Remember Death and the Grave:** This is a powerful purifier of intentions. When you remember that you will soon be in your grave, alone, with only your deeds, the praise of people will seem utterly meaningless.\n\n8.  **Be Indifferent to Praise and Blame:**\n    *   Train yourself to not feel elated by praise or dejected by criticism when it comes to your good deeds. Your standard is Allah's pleasure, not human approval.\n    *   If someone praises you for a good deed, say \"Alhamdulillah\" (All praise is due to Allah) and remind yourself that it's from Allah's grace that you were able to do it, and you still need His acceptance.\n\n9.  **Practice Humility (Tawadhu):** Counter self-admiration by acknowledging that any good you do is by Allah's grace and ability, not your own.\n\n10. **Do Not Stop Good Deeds:** Shaytan wants you to stop doing good because of these feelings. Do not let him win! Keep striving, keep doing good, and keep fighting for sincerity. The struggle itself is a sign of faith and will be rewarded.\n\n---\n\nThis journey of purifying intentions is a lifelong one. Be patient with yourself, seek Allah's help constantly, and remember that Allah is The Most Forgiving, The Most Merciful. Your awareness of this issue is a tremendous blessing; use it as a catalyst for spiritual growth."}
{"Question": "Q: I was urinating in the toilet, I was careful not to try and avoid any splash back so I put some tissue into the toilet. After urinating I noticed 2 specks of urine on my left fingers. I could not see any other specks of urine. Are specks of urine overlooked completely. Also I was washing my private area, I find it easy to use the tap and run water over it, that is the only way at work, after water had run off my private area (penis) some water splashed back. Is this water najis or not? ? --T--", "Answer": "Wash that area regarding which you are sure that urine had splashed. And Allah Taala ( ) knows best", "Document": "Aishah reported :When the Messenger of Allah (May peace be upon him) would take a bath because of sexual defilement, according to the version of Sulaiman, in the beginning he would pour water with his right hand (upon his left hand); and according to the version of Musaddad, he would wash both (hands) pouring water from the vessel upon his right hand. According to the agreed version, he then would wash the private part. He would then perform ablution as he did for prayer, then put his hands in the vessel and made the water go through his hair. When he knew that water had reached the entire surface of the body and cleaned it well, he would pour water upon his head three times. If some water was left, he would pour it also upon himself.<D>Narrated Abdullah ibn az-Zubayr:A man disputed with az-Zubayr about streamlets in the lava plain which was irrigated by them. The Ansari said: Release the water and let it run, but az-Zubayr refused. The Holy Prophet () said to az-Zubayr: Water (your ground), Zubayr, then let the water run to your neighbour. The Ansari then became angry and said: Messenger of Allah! it is because he is your cousin!

Let's break down your questions according to Islamic jurisprudence:\n\n### 1. Specks of Urine on Fingers\n\n**Are specks of urine overlooked completely?**\n\nIn Islamic law, small, unavoidable specks of impurity, especially urine, are generally **excused (ma'fuw)**, particularly if they are difficult to avoid and do not constitute a noticeable amount.\n\nHere's why:\n\n*   **Minor Amount (Yasir):** \"2 specks\" is a minuscule amount. The general principle is that if the impurity is so small that it's difficult to perceive, or it's negligible, it doesn't nullify prayer or necessitate re-washing the entire hand/body part.\n*   **Difficulty of Avoidance (Haraj):** It is extremely difficult, if not impossible, to avoid every single microscopic splash when dealing with water and urine. Islam is a religion of ease and does not burden its followers beyond what is reasonable and possible.\n*   **No Burden (La Haraj):** If every tiny speck required a full re-washing, it would lead to extreme hardship and difficulty in daily life, which is contrary to the spirit of Islam.\n*   **Wasiwasi (Obsessive Doubts):** Over-scrutinizing such minor details can lead to *wasiwasi* (obsessive compulsive disorder in religious matters), which is highly discouraged in Islam.\n\n**Conclusion for urine specks:** No, you do not need to worry about these 2 specks. They are considered overlooked. If you had seen a clear, noticeable splash or a larger amount, you would wash it. But for such tiny, almost imperceptible specks, you are fine.\n\n### 2. Water Splashing Back After Washing Private Area\n\n**Is this water najis or not?**\n\nThis water is **NOT najis (impure)**. Here's the reasoning:\n\n*   **Purpose of Washing:** The act of washing (istinja) is to *remove* the original impurity (urine).\n*   **Water After Removal:** When you wash your private area, the water that first comes into contact with the urine becomes impure. However, as you continue to pour water and the impurity is removed, the subsequent water running off your private area is considered **pure**. This is because the actual *najasah* (impurity) has been cleaned away from your body part.\n*   **Cleanliness of the Area:** Once the area is clean (i.e., no visible or traceable impurity remains), any water that then splashes back from that *clean* area is considered clean water. It is not carrying residual impurity.\n*   **Practicality and Ease:** If this water were considered impure, it would be extremely difficult to purify oneself without making everything else impure. This would again lead to undue hardship and *wasiwasi*.\n\n**Conclusion for splashed water:** The water that splashes back after you have already cleaned your private area is considered pure. You do not need to worry about it or clean anything it touches.\n\n**General Advice:**\n\nIslam is a practical religion that seeks to make things easy for its followers. While cleanliness and purity are fundamental, the Shariah also accounts for common difficulties and avoids imposing undue burdens. Do not let minor doubts or unavoidable tiny splashes lead you into *wasiwasi*. Act based on certainty, and assume purity unless there is clear and certain evidence of significant impurity."}
{"Question": "I am a certified Electrocardiogram Technician. However, to do this job, I must place electrodes on a persons chest. I must place six on the chest and four on the arms and legs. However, I would have to look at a womens chest and even touch their left breast to properly place the leads. Would it be halal for me o get a job doing this, since I am a male. Also, would it make a difference if the patients were all old? I am also becoming a nurses aid. In this profession, I will deal with old people who are 65 years of age or older 99%of the time. I would have to give them baths, clean their genitals and anus. Can I as a Muslim male do this job? There are institutions where males take care of males only. However, during the training period I cant choose the setting where to practice, I will have to work with female patients. Would this be allowed for the training period only? ? --T--", "Answer": "The nakedness (awra) of a woman in front of a non-Mahram male is all her body except her face, hands and feet, and the nakedness of a male is from below his navel up to and including his knees. (See: the major fiqh references). Hence, it will not be permitted to expose, see or touch the Awra except in the most dire of situations.Medical treatment is considered by the jurists (fuqaha) to be a genuine case of need; hence, they permit a male practitioner to examine and treat the effected area of a womans body, provided certain conditions are met.The renowned Hanafi jurist, Imam al-Haskafi (Allah have mercy on him) states whilst discussing the genuine reasons for the permissibility of a man looking at a womans Awra: And for medical treatment, in that a male doctor may look at (and treat) the effected area (of a womans body) but only to the extent of need, for cases of need are restricted to the actual need And it is preferable that the male doctor teaches and instructs a female to treat her, for looking at (and treating) someone from the same gender is a lesser of an evil. (See: Radd al-Muhtar ala al-Durr al-Mukhtar, 6/371)Imam Ibn Abidin (Allah have mercy on him) explains in his Radd al-Muhtar that, if the treatment is connected to the private parts of a woman, then only in extreme situations will it be permitted for her to be treated by a male doctor. He states: If the treatment is on her private parts, then he should teach and instruct a female to treat her. If this is not possible and it is feared that the woman patient may perish or undergo unbearable pains, only then will it be permissible for a male doctor to treat her, provided her non-effected parts of the body are completely covered and provided he keeps his gaze low as much as possible except from the effected area. (ibid)Based on the above, in principle it would be permitted for you to take up your profession as an electrocardiogram technician or work as a nurses aid. However, in the situation where you will be required to treat and touch the Awra of a woman, especially her genital area, you will need to keep the following in mind:If a female is available to treat the woman patient, it will not be permitted for you to treat her, especially when the treatment is connected to her private parts; rather, you will have to instruct a female to carry out the treatment. You should try and avoid treating the genital and breast areas of a woman. However, if the case is extreme, in that there is no female available to treat or examine her, and it is feared that her condition will worsen; then it will be allowed for you to treat her. In doing so, you must ensure to keep your gaze away from parts of the body that do not require to be examined, and also ensure that those areas of her body are properly covered. If possible, have a third person with you whilst treating the female patient, such as her husband, brother and the like. Always be conscious of accountability to Allah Most High", "Document": "Anas b.

The core of the answer lies in the Islamic principles of *awrah* (modesty/parts of the body that must be covered), *ghadd al-basar* (lowering the gaze), and the concept of *darura* (necessity) or *hajah* (need).\n\n**General Islamic Principles Relevant to Healthcare:**\n\n1.  **Awrah:** For a male, the *awrah* of a non-mahram woman (any woman he could potentially marry) is generally considered to be her entire body except for her face and hands. Direct viewing or touching of this *awrah* is prohibited.\n2.  **Ghadd al-Basar (Lowering the Gaze):** Muslims are commanded to lower their gaze and not look at what is forbidden.\n3.  **Necessity (Darura/Hajah):** Islam allows for actions that would otherwise be prohibited if there is a genuine, unavoidable necessity or a significant need, especially when human life, health, or dignity is at stake, and no permissible alternative exists. This permission is granted with strict conditions and limited to the extent of the necessity.\n\nLet's break down your questions for both professions:\n\n---\n\n### 1. Electrocardiogram (ECG) Technician\n\n**The Challenge:** Placing electrodes on a woman's chest, potentially looking at and touching her left breast.\n\n**Islamic Ruling:**\n\n*   **Default:** In normal circumstances, a male looking at or touching the *awrah* of a non-mahram female is not permissible. This includes the chest area.\n*   **Medical Necessity (Darura):** However, medical procedures fall under the category of necessity.\n    *   **Ideal Scenario:** The ideal and preferred Islamic approach is for a female technician to perform an ECG on a female patient.\n    *   **If No Female Technician is Available:** If there is no female ECG technician available, and the ECG is medically necessary for diagnosis or treatment (i.e., the patient's health would be compromised without it), then it may be permissible for a male technician to perform the procedure.\n        *   **Conditions for Permissibility (under necessity):**\n            *   **Strict Necessity:** The ECG must be truly necessary, not just a routine or optional test for which a female technician could be found later.\n            *   **No Female Alternative:** There must be no qualified female technician available at that time.\n            *   **Minimize Exposure:** Only expose the absolute minimum required area of the body for the procedure.\n            *   **Lower Gaze:** Focus solely on the task at hand, avoid prolonged or unnecessary looking at the *awrah*.\n            *   **Minimize Touch:** Touch only what is necessary for electrode placement.\n            *   **Professionalism:** Maintain a professional demeanor at all times, with no improper intentions or thoughts.\n            *   **Chaperone (Recommended):** If possible, having another female (e.g., a nurse, a family member) in the room during the procedure is highly recommended to ensure modesty and prevent any misunderstandings or *fitna* (temptation/strife).\n\n**Does Age Make a Difference (Old Patients)?**\n\n*   Some classical scholars have discussed a degree of leniency regarding very old women (past childbearing age, who no longer have sexual desire) based on Qur'an 24:60.\n*   **However, the *awrah* technically remains *awrah*.** While the risk of *fitna* (temptation) might be significantly reduced, the fundamental prohibition of looking at or touching the *awrah* without necessity still applies.\n*   Therefore, even with old patients, the conditions of necessity (no female alternative, minimal exposure/touch, lowering gaze) should still be adhered to as much as possible. It does not make it generally permissible if a female technician is available.\n\n**Conclusion for ECG Tech:** It would be **permissible only under conditions of genuine medical necessity** where no female technician is available, and strict Islamic guidelines for modesty (minimizing exposure, lowering gaze, necessary touch only) are followed.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Nurses Aid\n\n**The Challenge:** Giving baths, cleaning genitals and anus of female patients, especially old ones.\n\n**Islamic Ruling:**\n\n*   **Default:** This involves direct viewing and touching of the *awrah al-mughalladhah* (most severe *awrah* - genitals and anus). This is absolutely prohibited between non-mahrams in normal circumstances.\n*   **Medical Necessity/Care (Darura/Hajah):** Caring for the sick and elderly, especially those who are incapacitated and cannot care for themselves, is a profound necessity. Neglecting their personal hygiene can lead to severe health complications, discomfort, and loss of dignity.\n    *   **Ideal Scenario:** The ideal and strongly preferred Islamic approach is for a female caregiver to attend to the personal hygiene needs of a female patient. This aligns perfectly with Islamic modesty.\n    *   **If No Female Caregiver is Available:** If there is absolutely no female caregiver available to perform these essential tasks, and the patient's health and well-being would be severely compromised without immediate care, then it may be permissible for a male caregiver to provide the necessary care.\n        *   **Conditions for Permissibility (under extreme necessity):**\n            *   **Absolute Necessity:** The patient's immediate need for hygiene and care must be critical, and there must be no female staff or family members available or capable of performing the task.\n            *   **No Female Alternative:** This is crucial. If there is a female nurse, aide, or family member who can do it, she must.\n            *   **Minimize Exposure:** Only expose the parts of the body that are absolutely necessary for the task at hand, and cover the rest.\n            *   **Lower Gaze:** Focus strictly on the task, avoid any unnecessary looking.\n            *   **Minimize Touch:** Touch only what is required for cleaning.\n            *   **Professionalism:** Maintain the highest level of professionalism and purity of intention.\n            *   **Privacy:** Ensure the patient's privacy is maintained to the maximum extent possible (e.g., drawing curtains, closing doors).\n\n**Does Age Make a Difference (Old Patients, 65+)?**\n\n*   Similar to the ECG discussion, while the risk of *fitna* might be negligible with very old patients, the *awrah* status remains.\n*   The primary justification for a male caring for a female in this intimate way is *necessity* (the patient's health and dignity), not the patient's age per se. So, the same strict conditions apply.\n\n**Training Period Only:**\n\n*   **The Problem:** You cannot choose the setting during training and will have to work with female patients.\n*   **Islamic Perspective on Training/Learning:** Seeking knowledge and skills, especially in a beneficial field like healthcare, is generally encouraged in Islam. However, it cannot supersede clear prohibitions unless there's an overriding necessity.\n*   **Is Training a Necessity?** This is a strong argument for *hajah* (need). If gaining this certification and skill is crucial for you to find employment in a field where you *can* primarily serve male patients, then the temporary exposure during training might be permissible under strict conditions.\n    *   **Conditions for Permissibility (for training period):**\n        1.  **Genuine Need for the Skill:** You are acquiring a skill that is beneficial for society and for which there is a demand (especially for male patients, which is your goal).\n        2.  **No Permissible Alternative for Training:** You genuinely cannot complete your training without this temporary exposure to female patients. If there are male-only training facilities or options, you should pursue those first.\n        3.  **Strict Intention:** Your intention must be pure: to gain the necessary skills to perform a vital service, with the ultimate goal of working primarily with male patients. It must *not* be for any improper gratification or casual exposure.\n        4.  **Minimize to the Utmost:** During training, strive to minimize exposure and touch as described above. Only do what is absolutely required by the training curriculum.\n        5.  **Active Pursuit of Male-Only Settings:** After training, you must actively and diligently seek employment in institutions or settings where you can primarily care for male patients, as this is the Islamic ideal. The temporary allowance for training is not a permanent license.\n        6.  **Chaperone/Supervision:** It is very likely that during training, you will be supervised by an instructor. This provides an additional layer of accountability and oversight.\n\n**Conclusion for Nurses Aid (Training Period):** Given the necessity of acquiring essential skills for a beneficial profession, and your stated intention to primarily care for male patients afterward, it **could be permissible for the training period only**, provided you adhere to the strictest Islamic guidelines of modesty, necessity, and minimizing interaction, and actively work towards securing a role with male patients post-training.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Recommendation:\n\n1.  **Prioritize Female Caregivers for Females:** Always advocate for and facilitate female healthcare professionals to attend to female patients whenever possible.\n2.  **Prioritize Male Caregivers for Males:** Similarly, males should care for males.\n3.  **Necessity is Key:** Only when there is no other qualified and available option, and the patient's health or well-being depends on it, does the exception of necessity apply.\n4.  **Minimize Exposure and Touch:** In all situations, whether ECG or personal care, uncover only the necessary area, lower your gaze, and touch only what is strictly required for the procedure.\n5.  **Seek Guidance:** For specific, personal situations, it is always best to consult with a knowledgeable local Imam or Islamic scholar who understands the context of healthcare practice in your region. They can provide a tailored fatwa.\n\nMay Allah grant you ease and guide you in your noble profession."}

Then a man came to Moses and asked, O Allahs Apostle! Is there anyone on the earth who is more learned than you? Moses replied, No. So Allah admonished him (Moses), for he did not ascribe all knowledge to Allah. It was said, (on behalf of Allah), Yes, (there is a slave of ours who knows more than you ). Moses said, O my Lord! Where is he? Allah said, At the junction of the two seas. Moses said, O my Lord ! Tell I me of a sign whereby I will recognize the place. \" `Amr said to me, Allah said, \"That place will be where the fish will leave you.\" Ya`la said to me, \"Allah said (to Moses), Take a dead fish (and your goal will be) the place where it will become alive. \" So Moses took a fish and put it in a basket and said to his boy-servant \"I dont want to trouble you, except that you should inform me as soon as this fish leaves you.\" He said (to Moses).\" You have not demanded too much.\" And that is as mentioned by Allah: And (remember) when Moses said to his attendant ....

Then they returned back and found Al-Khadir. `Uthman bin Abi Sulaiman said to me, (they found him) on a green carpet in the middle of the sea. Al-Khadir was covered with his garment with one end under his feet and the other end under his head. When Moses greeted, he uncovered his face and said astonishingly, Is there such a greeting in my land? Who are you? Moses said, I am Moses. Al- Khadir said, Are you the Moses of Bani Israel? Moses said, Yes. Al-Khadir said, \"What do you want? Moses said,  I came to you so that you may teach me of the truth which you were taught. Al- Khadir said, Is it not sufficient for you that the Torah is in your hands and the Divine Inspiration comes to you, O Moses? Verily, I have a knowledge that you ought not learn, and you have a knowledge which I ought not learn. At that time a bird took with its beak (some water) from the sea: Al-Khadir then said, By Allah, my knowledge and your knowledge besides Allahs Knowledge is like what this bird has taken with its beak from the sea. Until, when they went on board the boat (18.71). They found a small boat which used to carry the people from this sea-side to the other sea-side. The crew recognized Al-Khadir and said, The pious slave of Allah. (We said to Sa`id \"Was that Khadir?\" He said, \"Yes.\") The boat men said, We will not get him on board with fare. Al-Khadir scuttled the boat and then plugged the hole with a piece o wood. Moses said, Have you scuttle it in order to drown these people surely, you have done a dreadful thing. (18.71) (Mujahid said. \"Moses said so protestingly.\") Al-Khadir said, didnt I say that you can have no patience with me? (18.72) The first inquiry of Moses was done because of forget fullness, the second caused him to be bound with a stipulation, and the third was done he intentionally. Moses said, Call me not to account for what I forgot and be not hard upon me for my affair (with you). (18.73) (Then) they found a boy and Al-Khadir killed him. Ya`la- said: Sa`id said They found boys playing and Al-Khadir got hold of a handsome infidel boy laid him down and then slew him with knife. Moses said, Have you killed a innocent soul who has killed nobody (18.74) Then they proceeded and found a wall which was on the point of falling down, and Al-Khadir set it up straight Sa`id moved his hand thus and said Al-Khadir raised his hand and the wall became straight. Ya`la said, I think Sa`id said, Al-Khadir touched the wall with his hand and it became straight (Moses said to Al-Khadir), If you had wished, you could have taken wages for it. Sa`id said, Wages that we might had eaten. And there was a king in furor (ahead) of them\" (18.79) And there was in front of them. Ibn `Abbas recited: In front of them (was) a king. It is said on the authority of somebody other than Sa`id that the king was Hudad bin Budad. They say that the boy was called Haisur. A king who seized every ship by force. (18.79) So I wished that if that boat passed by him, he would leave it because of its defect and when they have passed they would repair it and get benefit from it. Some people said that they closed that hole with a bottle, and some said with tar. His parents were believers, and he (the boy) was a non-believer and we(Khadir) feared lest he would oppress them by obstinate rebellion and disbelief. (18.80) (i.e. that their love for him would urge them to follow him in his religion, so we (Khadir) desired that their Lord should change him for them for one better in righteousness and near to mercy (18:81). This was in reply to Moses saying: Have you killed an innocent soul.? (18.74). Near to mercy\" means they will be more merciful to him than they were to the former whom Khadir had killed. Other than Sa`id, said that they were compensated with a girl. Dawud bin Abi `Asim said on the authority of more than one that this next child was a girl.<D>(O ye who believe! When ye rise up for prayer) and you are not in a state of minor ritual purity, He has taught you what to do, saying: (wash your face, and your hands up to the elbows, and lightly rub your heads) as you please (and (wash) your feet) above the sole of the feet (up to the ankles.

It's a profoundly painful experience, and it's completely natural to feel concerned and to seek solace and hope for a healthy future pregnancy. May Allah grant you ease, comfort, and a healthy, righteous offspring. Ameen.\n\nIn Islam, a \"wazifa\" generally refers to specific prayers, supplications (duas), and recitations of Quranic verses or Allah's names seeking Allah's help, protection, and blessings. It's important to remember that while spiritual practices are immensely powerful and bring peace and barakah (blessings), they should complement, not replace, medical advice and care.\n\nHere is a comprehensive approach combining spiritual guidance with practical advice:\n\n**I. Spiritual Wazifa and Duas for a Healthy Baby and Protection:**\n\n1.  **Dua of Prophet Zakariyya (AS):** This is one of the most powerful duas for seeking righteous offspring, as Prophet Zakariyya (AS) prayed for a child when he and his wife were old and barren.\n    *   **Quran 3:38:**\n        **\"Rabbi hab li mil ladunka dhurriyyatan tayyibah; innaka sami'ud-du'a.\"**\n        *(My Lord, grant me from Yourself a good offspring. Indeed, You are the Hearer of supplication.)*\n        *Recite this frequently, with conviction, especially after Fajr and Maghrib prayers.*\n\n    *   **Quran 21:89:**\n        **\"Rabbi la tazarni fardaw wa anta khayrul-warithin.\"**\n        *(My Lord, do not leave me alone [without an heir], while You are the best of inheritors.)*\n        *Recite this regularly as well.*\n\n2.  **General Dua for Righteous Offspring (Quran 25:74):**\n    **\"Rabbana hab lana min azwajina wa dhurriyatina qurrata a'yunin waj'alna lil-muttaqina imama.\"**\n    *(Our Lord, grant us from among our wives and offspring comfort to our eyes and make us leaders of the righteous.)*\n    *This is a beautiful and comprehensive dua for family well-being.*\n\n3.  **Ayat al-Kursi (Quran 2:255):**\n    Recite Ayat al-Kursi after every obligatory prayer and before sleeping. It is a powerful verse for protection from all kinds of harm and evil.\n\n4.  **Last Three Surahs of the Quran:**\n    *   **Surah Al-Ikhlas (112)**\n    *   **Surah Al-Falaq (113)**\n    *   **Surah An-Nas (114)**\n    Recite these three surahs three times after Fajr and Maghrib prayers, and before sleeping. Blow into your cupped hands and then wipe over your body. These provide comprehensive protection.\n\n5.  **Istighfar (Seeking Forgiveness):**\n    Regularly say **\"Astaghfirullah\"** (I seek forgiveness from Allah). Seeking forgiveness opens doors to Allah's blessings and removes obstacles. The Quran mentions that seeking forgiveness can lead to increase in wealth and children (Quran 71:10-12).\n\n6.  **Salawat (Durood) on Prophet Muhammad (PBUH):**\n    Send blessings upon the Prophet (PBUH) frequently, such as **\"Allahumma Salli 'ala Muhammadin wa 'ala ali Muhammad.\"** This is known to make duas more likely to be accepted.\n\n7.  **Sadaqah (Charity):**\n    Give charity, even a small amount, regularly with the intention of seeking Allah's blessings for a healthy child and protection from problems. Sadaqah is known to avert calamities and draw Allah's mercy.\n\n8.  **Duas at Specific Times:**\n    *   During the last third of the night (Tahajjud time).\n    *   Between the Adhan and Iqamah.\n    *   When breaking your fast (if fasting).\n    *   During rain.\n    *   While prostrating in prayer (Sujood).\n\n9.  **Trust in Allah (Tawakkul) and Patience:**\n    Have firm faith that Allah is the ultimate bestower and protector. Do your part (spiritual and medical) and then leave the outcome to Him. Be patient and steadfast in your prayers.\n\n**II. Practical and Medical Advice:**\n\n1.  **Consult a Doctor:** This is paramount.\n    *   It is *highly recommended* to consult with a gynecologist or a fertility specialist to investigate the cause of the miscarriage. There might be underlying medical conditions (e.g., hormonal imbalances, chromosomal issues, structural problems) that can be addressed to improve your chances of a healthy future pregnancy.\n    *   They can provide pre-conception counseling and guidance.\n\n2.  **Pre-conception Health:**\n    *   **Folic Acid:** Start taking folic acid supplements (usually 400 mcg daily) at least one month before trying to conceive and continue through the first trimester. This significantly reduces the risk of neural tube defects.\n    *   **Healthy Diet:** Eat a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins.\n    *   **Maintain a Healthy Weight:** Being underweight or overweight can affect fertility and pregnancy outcomes.\n    *   **Avoid Harmful Substances:** Stop smoking, avoid alcohol, and limit caffeine intake.\n    *   **Manage Chronic Conditions:** If you have any chronic health conditions (e.g., diabetes, hypertension, thyroid issues), ensure they are well-managed before and during pregnancy.\n    *   **Stress Reduction:** Miscarriages are emotionally taxing. Engage in stress-reducing activities like light exercise, yoga, meditation, spending time in nature, or reading Quran.\n\n3.  **Emotional Well-being:**\n    *   Allow yourself time to grieve and heal from the miscarriage.\n    *   Talk to your spouse, trusted friends, or family about your feelings.\n    *   Consider seeking support from a counselor or support group if you find it difficult to cope.\n    *   Remember that many women experience miscarriages, and most go on to have healthy pregnancies afterward.\n\n4.  **Spousal Support:**\n    Ensure you and your husband are supportive of each other throughout this journey, both emotionally and spiritually. Pray together and encourage each other.\n\nMay Allah ease your difficulties, grant you strength, and bless you with a healthy, righteous child very soon. Ameen."}
{"Question": "Q: Is it Makrooh Tanzihi or Tahrimi to remove the white or grey hair from the beard? Is the rule for the beard and the hair is the same? ? --T--", "Answer": "To cut the beard before one fist is not permissible. Obviously, this white hair will be from the one fist, hence it will not be correct. The rule for the hair of the head is that all the hair should be even. To cut off some and leave some is not permissible. And Allah Taala ( ) knows best", "Document": "It was narrated that Ibn Umar said:\"The Messenger of Allah [SAW] cursed the woman who affixes hair extensions and the one who has that done, and the woman who does tattoos and the one who has that done.\"<D>Karimah said:\"I heard a woman asking Aishah about dyeing the hair with Henna. She said: There is nothing wrong with it, but I do not like to do it because my beloved- meaning the Prophet [SAW]- disliked its smell.\"<D>The tradition mentioned above has also been transmitted by ‘Abd al- Malik b. ‘Umar through a different chain of narrators. This version has:They uncovered my private parts, and when they found that the hair had not begun to grow they put me among the captives.<D>Then Allah mentioned his blessings so that they thank Him and believe in Him, saying: (And Allah hath given you in your houses) the houses of mud (an abode) and dwelling, (and hath given you (also), of the hides of cattle) of their wool, fur and hair, (houses) i.e. tents and canopies (which ye find light (to carry) on the day of migration) travel (and on the day of pitching camp; and of their wool) the wool of sheep (and their fur) the fur of camels (and their hair) the hair of goats, (caparison) wealth (and comfort) benefit (for a while) until their extinction or wearing out.<D>(Hast thou not seen) have you not been informed in the Scripture about (those who praise themselves for purity?) those who absolve themselves from transgression. The reference here is to Buhayr Ibn Amr and Marhab Ibn Zayd.

It is not typically considered **Makrooh Tahrimi** (closer to prohibited, sinful).\n\nHere's a breakdown of the ruling and the reasons:\n\n1.  **Ruling for the Beard:**\n    *   The general consensus among scholars from the four main Sunni schools of thought (Hanafi, Maliki, Shafi'i, Hanbali) is that plucking white or grey hairs from the beard (or head) is **Makrooh Tanzihi**.\n    *   **Basis:** This ruling is based on several Prophetic narrations (Ahadith), such as:\n        *   Umar ibn al-Khattab (RA) narrated: \"Do not pluck white hairs, for they are a Muslim's light on the Day of Resurrection.\" (Reported by Abu Dawud, Tirmidhi, Nasa'i, and Ahmad).\n        *   Another narration states: \"Whoever has a white hair in Islam, it will be a light for him on the Day of Resurrection.\" (Reported by Ibn Majah).\n    *   **Wisdom:**\n        *   **Light on the Day of Resurrection:** The primary reason mentioned in the Ahadith. White hair is seen as a sign of age and a reminder of one's mortality and the coming of the afterlife, thus increasing one's good deeds and light.\n        *   **Dignity and Respect:** White hair often signifies age, experience, and dignity, especially for men. Removing it might be seen as an act of vanity or an attempt to defy the natural process of aging, which is Allah's creation.\n        *   **Acceptance of Allah's Decree:** It is a manifestation of accepting the changes that Allah decrees upon a person's body.\n\n2.  **Makrooh Tanzihi vs. Makrooh Tahrimi:**\n    *   **Makrooh Tanzihi:** Something disliked, better to avoid, but not sinful if done. It's an action that is less preferred, and abstaining from it brings reward.\n    *   **Makrooh Tahrimi:** Something strongly disliked, closer to Haram (forbidden), and generally considered sinful if done consistently without valid reason.\n    *   The act of plucking white hair falls under **Makrooh Tanzihi** because while the Hadith discourages it, it doesn't carry the severe warnings or punishments associated with truly forbidden acts. It's more of a guidance towards what is better and more virtuous.\n\n3.  **Rule for the Beard vs. Other Hair:**\n    *   The rule generally applies to both the **beard and the hair on the head**. The Ahadith often refer to \"white hairs\" in general, which includes both.\n    *   Given the high status and emphasis on the beard in Islam as part of the *Sunnah* (Prophetic tradition) and an distinguishing feature, the ruling would apply equally strongly, if not more so, to the beard.\n    *   The wisdom of \"light on the Day of Resurrection\" and \"acceptance of Allah's decree\" applies to white hair wherever it appears naturally on the visible parts of the body (head and face).\n\n**Alternative:**\nInstead of plucking, it is permissible and even recommended to dye white or grey hair, provided the dye is permissible (e.g., henna, katam, or other natural dyes) and does not involve pure black dye, which is generally discouraged unless for specific reasons in war or to hide very few strands. The purpose of dyeing is to change the colour, not to remove the hair itself.\n\nIn summary, it is **Makrooh Tanzihi** to remove white or grey hair from the beard, and the same ruling generally applies to hair on the head. It is better to leave it or dye it."}
{"Question": "Ive some skin disease on the upper part of my both feet. I put medication on them twice daily.

He said: Taha, which in the dialect of Mecca means: O man, i.e. O Muhammad, We have not sent Gabriel with the Quran for you to toil.", "Generated_Answer": "This is a common concern in Islamic practice, and thankfully, Islamic law is very merciful and practical, especially when it comes to health. Given that this is a long-term condition and doctors have explicitly advised against wetting the feet for healing, you have valid dispensations.\n\nHere are the main Islamic rulings that apply to your situation:\n\n### 1. Masah alal Jabirah (Wiping over a Bandage/Dressing/Protective Covering)\n\nThis is perhaps the most direct and widely accepted solution for your situation.\n\n*   **The Principle:** If a part of your body required for wudu (like your feet) has a wound, rash, or disease, and wetting it would cause harm or delay healing (as per your doctors' advice), you are permitted to *wipe* over the affected area or any bandage/dressing/medication applied to it, instead of washing the skin directly.\n*   **How it applies to you:**\n    *   **The \"Wound\":** Your skin disease acts as the \"wound\" that needs protection.\n    *   **The \"Dressing\":** The medication you apply, and potentially a light covering like a sock (if it acts as a protective layer and cannot easily be removed without causing harm/re-wetting the medicated area), can be considered a \"jabirah\" (dressing/bandage) in a broader sense.\n    *   **Action:** Perform wudu as normal: wash your face, arms up to the elbows, and wipe your head. When you get to your feet:\n        *   If the medication itself is forming a protective layer, or if you apply a light gauze or wrap over the medicated area, you can simply pass your wet hand over that area once instead of washing the skin underneath.\n        *   If removing your socks (which are covering the medicated area to protect it or keep medication in place) would lead to the area getting wet or hinder healing, then you can perform *masah* (wiping) over your socks. Many scholars permit this when the socks are worn for medical reasons or when it causes undue hardship to remove them and expose the wound.\n*   **Important Note:** The intent here is that the *unaffected* parts of your feet (like the bottom or areas not diseased) should still be washed *if* it's possible without any water splashing onto the affected top part. However, if, as you mentioned, washing the bottom inevitably leads to the top getting wet, or if it's too difficult to isolate, then wiping over the entire foot (if covered for medical reasons) or resorting to Tayammum becomes the option.\n\n### 2. Tayammum (Dry Ablution)\n\nThis is also a perfectly valid and often easier option, especially if even trying to wash the bottom of your feet causes the top to get wet, or if the \"Masah alal Jabirah\" option feels too complicated or uncertain.\n\n*   **The Principle:** Tayammum is allowed when one cannot use water for wudu or ghusl due to a valid Islamic reason. One primary reason is the *fear of harm* (or exacerbation of an illness, or delay in healing) from using water.\n*   **How it applies to you:** Your doctor's clear instruction not to wet your feet *for healing* directly falls under this category of \"harm.\"\n*   **Action:**\n    *   Perform Tayammum *instead of* washing your feet (or even instead of the entire wudu, if you find it too difficult to wash other parts without affecting your feet).\n    *   **How to perform Tayammum:**\n        1.  Make the intention to perform Tayammum for prayer.\n        2.  Lightly strike clean earth (or anything that contains earth particles, like a dusty wall, rock, or even clean sand/tile) with both palms.\n        3.  Wipe your entire face once with your palms.\n        4.  Strike the earth again with both palms.\n        5.  Wipe your right arm up to the elbow with your left hand, then your left arm up to the elbow with your right hand.\n    *   **Duration:** You can continue to perform Tayammum for your feet (or full wudu) for as long as your medical condition persists and your doctors advise against wetting your feet. There is no specific time limit in Islamic law for such dispensations.\n\n### Which Option to Choose?\n\n*   **Masah alal Jabirah** is generally preferred if only a *specific part* of the limb is affected, and the rest of the wudu can be performed with water without difficulty. If you can wash your face, arms, and wipe your head normally, and then wipe over the top of your feet (or over a sock that's protecting the medicated area), this would be ideal.\n*   **Tayammum** is a very strong and valid option if *any* attempt to use water for your feet (even washing the bottom) inevitably leads to the top getting wet and causing harm, or if you simply find it easier and more reassuring given the long-term nature. It completely replaces the need for water for the parts it covers.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nYou are *absolutely* allowed to leave your feet unwetted or to perform *Masah alal Jabirah* or *Tayammum* for such a long time, as long as the medical necessity persists. Islam prioritizes your health and ease. The advice of Muslim doctors in this regard is a valid and recognized reason for seeking these dispensations.\n\nDo not feel any guilt or worry. Allah (SWT) knows your situation and has provided these merciful provisions for believers facing hardship."}
{"Question": "Q: I wanted to ask can we give zam zam water to a Hindu as he is suffering from constant hiccups for over many years. ? --T--", "Answer": "It is permissible.

We heard that a man had appeared in Mecca, claiming to be a Prophet. ! said to my brother, Go to that man and talk to him and bring me his news. He set out, met him and returned. I asked him, What is the news with you? He said, By Allah, I saw a man enjoining what is good and forbidding what is evil. I said to him, You have not satisfied me with this little information. So, I took a waterskin and a stick and proceeded towards Mecca. Neither did I know him (i.e. the Prophet ), nor did I like to ask anyone about him. I Kept on drinking Zam zam water and staying in the Mosque. Then `Ali passed by me and said, It seems you are a stranger? I said, Yes. He proceeded to his house and I accompanied him. Neither did he ask me anything, nor did I tell him anything. Next morning I went to the Mosque to ask about the Prophet but no-one told me anything about him. `Ali passed by me again and asked, Hasnt the man recognized his dwelling place yet I said, No. He said, Come along with me. He asked me, What is your business? What has brought you to this town? I said to him, If you keep my secret, I will tell you. He said, I will do, I said to him, We have heard that a person has appeared here, claiming to be a Prophet. I sent my brother to speak to him and when he returned, he did not bring a satisfactory report; so I thought of meeting him personally. `Ali said (to Abu Dhar), You have reached your goal; I am going to him just now, so follow me, and wherever I enter, enter after me. If I should see someone who may cause you trouble, I will stand near a wall pretending to mend my shoes (as a warning), and you should go away then. `Ali proceeded and I accompanied him till he entered a place, and I entered with him to the Prophet to whom I said, Present (the principles of) Islam to me. When he did, I embraced Islam immediately. He said to me, O Abu Dhar! Keep your conversion as a secret and return to your town; and when you hear of our victory, return to us.  I said, By H him Who has sent you with the Truth, I will announce my conversion to Islam publicly amongst them (i.e. the infidels), Abu Dhar went to the Mosque, where some people from Quraish were present, and said, O folk of Quraish ! I testify that None has the right to be worshipped except Allah, and I (also) testify that Muhammad is Allahs Slave and His Apostle. (Hearing that) the Quraishi men said, Get at this Sabi (i.e. Muslim) ! They got up and beat me nearly to death. Al `Abbas saw me and threw himself over me to protect me. He then faced them and said, Woe to you! You want to kill a man from the tribe of Ghifar, although your trade and your communications are through the territory of Ghifar? They therefore left me. The next morning I returned (to the Mosque) and said the same as I have said on the previous day. They again said, Get at this Sabi! I was treated in the same way as on the previous day, and again Al-Abbas found me and threw himself over me to protect me and told them the same as he had said the day before. So, that was the conversion of Abu Dhar (may Allah be Merciful to him) to Islam.\"<D>Narrated Ibn `Abbas:The first lady to use a girdle was the mother of Ishmael. She used a girdle so that she might hide her tracks from Sarah. Abraham brought her and her son Ishmael while she was suckling him, to a place near the Ka`ba under a tree on the spot of Zamzam, at the highest place in the mosque. During those days there was nobody in Mecca, nor was there any water So he made them sit over there and placed near them a leather bag containing some dates, and a small water-skin containing some water, and set out homeward. Ishmaels mother followed him saying, \"O Abraham! Where are you going, leaving us in this valley where there is no person whose company we may enjoy, nor is there anything (to enjoy)?\" She repeated that to him many times, but he did not look back at her Then she asked him, \"Has Allah ordered you to do so?\" He said, \"Yes.\" She said, \"Then He will not neglect us,\" and returned while Abraham proceeded onwards, and on reaching the Thaniya where they could not see him, he faced the Ka`ba, and raising both hands, invoked Allah saying the following prayers: O our Lord! I have made some of my offspring dwell in a valley without cultivation, by Your Sacred House (Ka`ba at Mecca) in order, O our Lord, that they may offer prayer perfectly. So fill some hearts among men with love towards them, and (O Allah) provide them with fruits, so that they may give thanks. (14.37) Ishmaels mother went on suckling Ishmael and drinking from the water (she had). When the water in the water-skin had all been used up, she became thirsty and her child also became thirsty. She started looking at him (i.e. Ishmael) tossing in agony; She left him, for she could not endure looking at him, and found that the mountain of Safa was the nearest mountain to her on that land. She stood on it and started looking at the valley keenly so that she might see somebody, but she could not see anybody. Then she descended from Safa and when she reached the valley, she tucked up her robe and ran in the valley like a person in distress and trouble, till she crossed the valley and reached the Marwa mountain where she stood and started looking, expecting to see somebody, but she could not see anybody. She repeated that (running between Safa and Marwa) seven times.\" The Prophet said, \"This is the source of the tradition of the walking of people between them (i.e. Safa and Marwa). When she reached the Marwa (for the last time) she heard a voice and she asked herself to be quiet and listened attentively. She heard the voice again and said, O, (whoever you may be)! You have made me hear your voice; have you got something to help me?\" And behold! She saw an angel at the place of Zamzam, digging the earth with his heel (or his wing), till water flowed from that place. She started to make something like a basin around it, using her hand in this way, and started filling her water-skin with water with her hands, and the water was flowing out after she had scooped some of it.\" The Prophet added, \"May Allah bestow Mercy on Ishmaels mother! Had she let the Zamzam (flow without trying to control it) (or had she not scooped from that water) (to fill her water-skin), Zamzam would have been a stream flowing on the surface of the earth.\" The Prophet further added, \"Then she drank (water) and suckled her child. The angel said to her, Dont be afraid of being neglected, for this is the House of Allah which will be built by this boy and his father, and Allah never neglects His people. The House (i.e. Ka`ba) at that time was on a high place resembling a hillock, and when torrents came, they flowed to its right and left. She lived in that way till some people from the tribe of Jurhum or a family from Jurhum passed by her and her child, as they (i.e. the Jurhum people) were coming through the way of Kada. They landed in the lower part of Mecca where they saw a bird that had the habit of flying around water and not leaving it. They said, This bird must be flying around water, though we know that there is no water in this valley. They sent one or two messengers who discovered the source of water, and returned to inform them of the water. So, they all came (towards the water).\" The Prophet added, \"Ishmaels mother was sitting near the water. They asked her, Do you allow us to stay with you?\" She replied, Yes, but you will have no right to possess the water. They agreed to that.\" The Prophet further said, \"Ishmaels mother was pleased with the whole situation as she used to love to enjoy the company of the people. So, they settled there, and later on they sent for their families who came and settled with them so that some families became permanent residents there. The child (i.e. Ishmael) grew up and learnt Arabic from them and (his virtues) caused them to love and admire him as he grew up, and when he reached the age of puberty they made him marry a woman from amongst them. After Ishmaels mother had died, Abraham came after Ishmaels marriage in order to see his family that he had left before, but he did not find Ishmael there. When he asked Ishmaels wife about him, she replied, He has gone in search of our livelihood. Then he asked her about their way of living and their condition, and she replied, We are living in misery; we are living in hardship and destitution, complaining to him. He said, When your husband returns, convey my salutation to him and tell him to change the threshold of the gate (of his house). When Ishmael came, he seemed to have felt something unusual, so he asked his wife, Has anyone visited you? She replied, Yes, an old man of so-and-so description came and asked me about you and I informed him, and he asked about our state of living, and I told him that we were living in a hardship and poverty. On that Ishmael said, Did he advise you anything? She replied, Yes, he told me to convey his salutation to you and to tell you to change the threshold of your gate. Ishmael said, It was my father, and he has ordered me to divorce you. Go back to your family. So, Ishmael divorced her and married another woman from amongst them (i.e. Jurhum). Then Abraham stayed away from them for a period as long as Allah wished and called on them again but did not find Ishmael. So he came to Ishmaels wife and asked her about Ishmael. She said, He has gone in search of our livelihood. Abraham asked her, How are you getting on? asking her about their sustenance and living. She replied, We are prosperous and well-off (i.e. we have everything in abundance). Then she thanked Allah Abraham said, What kind of food do you eat? She said. Meat. He said, What do you drink? She said, Water.\" He said, \"O Allah! Bless their meat and water.\" The Prophet added, \"At that time they did not have grain, and if they had grain, he would have also invoked Allah to bless it.\" The Prophet added, \"If somebody has only these two things as his sustenance, his health and disposition will be badly affected, unless he lives in Mecca.\" The Prophet added,\" Then Abraham said Ishmaels wife, \"When your husband comes, give my regards to him and tell him that he should keep firm the threshold of his gate. When Ishmael came back, he asked his wife, Did anyone call on you? She replied, Yes, a good-looking old man came to me, so she praised him and added. He asked about you, and I informed him, and he asked about our livelihood and I told him that we were in a good condition. Ishmael asked her, Did he give you any piece of advice? She said, Yes, he told me to give his regards to you and ordered that you should keep firm the threshold of your gate. On that Ishmael said, It was my father, and you are the threshold (of the gate). He has ordered me to keep you with me. Then Abraham stayed away from them for a period as long as Allah wished, and called on them afterwards. He saw Ishmael under a tree near Zamzam, sharpening his arrows. When he saw Abraham, he rose up to welcome him (and they greeted each other as a father does with his son or a son does with his father). Abraham said, O Ishmael! Allah has given me an order. Ishmael said, Do what your Lord has ordered you to do. Abraham asked, Will you help me? Ishmael said, I will help you. Abraham said, Allah has ordered me to build a house here, pointing to a hillock higher than the land surrounding it.\" The Prophet added, \"Then they raised the foundations of the House (i.e. the Ka`ba). Ishmael brought the stones and Abraham was building, and when the walls became high, Ishmael brought this stone and put it for Abraham who stood over it and carried on building, while Ishmael was handing him the stones, and both of them were saying, O our Lord! Accept (this service) from us, Verily, You are the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing. The Prophet added, \"Then both of them went on building and going round the Ka`ba saying: O our Lord ! Accept (this service) from us, Verily, You are the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing.\" (2.127)<D>Narrated Qaylah bint Makhramah:Abdullah ibn Hasan al-Anbari said: My grandmothers, Safiyyah and Duhaybah, narrated to me, that hey were the daughters of Ulaybah and were nourished by Qaylah, daughter of Makhramah. She was the grandmother of their father. She reported to them, saying: We came upon the Messenger of Allah (). My companion, Hurayth ibn Hassan, came to him as a delegate from Bakr ibn Wail. He took the oath of allegiance of Islam for himself and for his people. He then said: Messenger of Allah (), write a document for us, giving us the land lying between us and Banu Tamim at ad-Dahna to the effect that not one of them will cross it in our direction except a traveller or a passer-by. He said: Write down ad-Dahna for them, boy. When I saw that he passed orders to give it to him, I became anxious, for it was my native land and my home. I said: Messenger of Allah, he did not ask you for a true border when he asked you. This land of Dahna is a place where the camels have their home, and it is a pasture for the sheep. The women of Banu Tamim and their children are beyond it. He said: Stop, boy! A poor woman spoke the truth: a Muslim is a brother of a Muslim. Each one of them may benefit from water and trees, and they should cooperate with each other against Satan.<D>(That We may give life thereby to a dead land) a land that has no vegetation, (and We give many beasts and men that We have created to drink thereof.<D>(Then turned He to the heaven) then He turned to the creation of the heaven (when it was smoke) steam of water, (and said unto it) unto the heaven (and unto the earth) after He had created both: (Come both of you) give both of you the water and vegetation that you have, (willingly or loth.

(But most of them) all of them (know not) Allahs divine Oneness nor do they give thanks for His blessings.", "Generated_Answer": "Yes, absolutely. There is no prohibition in Islam against giving Zamzam water to a Hindu, especially when it's done out of kindness and compassion, and with the intention of seeking a cure or relief for someone suffering.\n\nHere's why:\n\n1.  **Zamzam's Nature:** The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) said: \"The water of Zamzam is for whatever it is drunk for.\" (Ahmad, Ibn Majah). Many Muslims drink it with the intention of healing from illnesses, seeking blessings, or fulfilling wishes. Its blessings are from Allah, and Allah's mercy and blessings are for all of creation.\n2.  **Kindness to All:** Islam highly encourages kindness, compassion, and helping others, regardless of their faith. Providing relief to someone in distress, like the person suffering from constant hiccups, is a noble act.\n3.  **No Exclusivity:** While Zamzam is sacred to Muslims, there's no religious decree that restricts its consumption to Muslims only. Just as you might share food, drink, or medicine with anyone in need, you can share Zamzam water.\n4.  **Intention:** Your intention is good – to help someone in pain. This aligns with Islamic principles of benevolence.\n\nTherefore, feel free to give the Zamzam water to your Hindu friend. It's an act of kindness and a way of seeking Allah's help and blessing for their condition."}

Until you are not certain then consider all the namaaz to be valid. And Allah Taala ( ) knows best", "Document": "Narrated Abdullah ibn Mughaffal:The Messenger of Allah () said: No one of you should make water in his bath and then wash himself there (after urination). The version of Ahmad has: Then performs ablution there, for evil thoughts come from it.<D>Jabir reported the Prophet () as saying:Shut your door and make mention of Allahs name, for the devil does not open a door which has been shut; extinguish your lamp and make mention of Allahs name, cover up your vessel even by a piece of wood that you just put on it and make mention of Allahs name, and tie up your water-skin mentioning Allahs name.<D>Ubadah b. Walid b. Samit reported:I and my father set out in search of knowledge to a tribe of the Ansar before their death (i. e. before the Companions of the Holy Prophet left the world) and I was the first to meet Abu Yasar, a Companion of Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) and there was a young man with him who carried the record of letters with him and there was a mantle prepared by the tribe of Maafiri upon him. And his servant too had a Maafiri mantle over him. My father said to him: My uncle, I see the signs of anger or that of agony on your face. He said: Yes, such and such person, the son of so and so, of the tribe of Harami owed me a debt. I went to his family, extended salutations and said: Where is he? They said: He is not here. Then came out to me his son who was at the threshold of his youth. I said to him: Where is your father? He said: No sooner did he hear your sound than he hid himself behind my mothers bedstead. I said to him: Walk out to me, for I know where you are. He came out. I said to him: What prompted you to hide yourself from me? He said: By God, whatever I would say to you would not be a lie. By Allah, I fear that I should tell a lie to you and in case of making promise with you I should break it, as you are the Companion of Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him). The fact is that I was hard up in regard to money. I said: Do you adjure by Allah? He said: I adjure by Allah. I said: Do you adjure by Allah? He said: I adjure by Allah. I said: Do you adjure by Allah? He said: I adjure by Allah. Then he brought his promissory note and he wrote off (the debt) with his hand and said: Make payment when you find yourself solvent enough to pay me back; if you are not, then there is no liability upon you. These two eyes of mine saw, and he (AbuI-Yasar) placed his fingers upon his eyes and these two ears of mine heard and my heart retained, and he pointed towards his heart that Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: He who gives time to one who is financially hard up (in the payment of debt) or writes off his debt, Allah will provide him His shadow. I said to him: My uncle, if you get the cloak of your servant and you give him your two clothes, or take his two clothes of Maafir and give him your cloak, then there would be one dress for you and one for him. He wiped my head and said: O Allah, bless the son of my brother. O, son of my brother, these two very eyes of mine saw and these two ears of mine listened to and this heart of mine retained this, and he pointed towards the heart that Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: Feed them (the servants) and clothe them (the servants) what you wear, and if I give him the goods of the world, it is easy for me than this that he should take my virtues on the Day of Resurrection. We went on till we came to Jabir b. Abdullah in the mosque and he was busy in observing prayer in one cloth which he had joined at its opposite ends. I made my way through the people till I sat between him and the Qibla and I said: May Allah have mercy upon you. Do you observe prayer with one cloth on your body whereas your mantle is lying at your side? He pointed me with his hand towards my breast just like this and he separated his fingers and bent them in the shape of a bow. And (he said): I thought that a fool like you should come to me so that he should see me as I do and he should then also do like it. Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) came to us in this very mosque and he had in his hand the twig of the palm-tree and he saw mucus towards the Qibla of the mosque and he erased it with the help of the twig. He then came to us and said: Who amongst you likes that Allah should turn His face away from him? We were afraid. He then again said: Who amongst you likes that Allah should turn His face away from him? We were afraid. He again said: Who amongst you likes that Allah should turn His face away from him? We said: Allahs Messenger, none of us likes it. And he said: If one amongst you stands for prayer, Allah, the Exalted and Glorious, is before him he should not spit in front of him, or on his right side, but should spit on his left side beneath his left foot and if he is impelled to do so all of a sudden (in spite of himself) he should then spit in his cloth and fold it in some part of it. (and he further said: ) Bring some sweet-smelling thing. A young man who belonged to our tribe stood up, went and brought scent in his palm. Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) took that and applied it to the end of that twig and then touched the place where there had been mucus. Jabir said: This is why you should apply scent to your mosques. It is reported on the same authority: We set out along with Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) on an expedition of Batn Buwat. He (the Holy Prophet) was in search of al-Majdi b. Amr al-Juhani. (We had so meagre equipment) that five. six or seven of us had one camel to ride and so we mounted it turn by turn. Once there wan. the turn of an Ansari to ride upon the camel. He made it kneel down to ride over it (and after having. mounted it), he tried to raise it up but it hesitated. So he said. May there be curse of Allah upon you! Thereupon Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: Who is there to curse his camel? He said: Allahs Messenger, it is I. Thereupon he said: Get down from the camel and let us not have in our company the cursed one. Dont curse your own selves, nor your children. nor your belongings. There is the possibility that your curse may synchronies with the time when Allah is about to confer upon you what you demand and thus your prayer may be readily responded. It is reported on the same authority: We set out on an expedition along with Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) until it was evening, and we had been near a. water reservoir of Arabia. Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: Who would be the person who would go ahead and set right the reservoir and drink water himself and serve us with it? Jabir said: I stood up and said: Allahs Messenger, it is I who am ready to do that. Thereupon Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: Who is the person to accompany Jabir? And then Jabbar b. Sakhr stood up. So we went to that well and poured in that tank a bucket or two of water and plastered it with clay and then began to fill it (with water) until it was filled to the brim. Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) was the first who appeared before us, and he said: Do you (both) permit me to drink water out of it? We said: Yea, Allahs Messenger. He led his camel to drink water and it drank. He then pulled its rein and it stretched its legs and began to urinate. He then took it aside and made it kneel down at another place and then came to the tank and performed ablution. I then got up and performed ablution like the ablution of Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him), and Jabbar b. Sakhr went in order to relieve himself and Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) got up to observe prayer and there was a mantle over me. I tried to invert its ends but it was too short (to cover my body easily). It had its borders. I then inverted it (the mantle) and drew its opposite ends and then tied them at my neck. I then came and stood upon the left side of Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him). He caught hold of me and made me go round behind him, until he made me stand on his right side. Then Jabbar b. Sakhr came. He performed ablution and then came and stood on the left side of Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him). Then Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) caught hold of our hands together, pushed us back and made us stand behind him. Then Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) began to look upon me with darting looks, but I did not perceive that. After that I became aware of it and he pointed with the gesture of his hand that I should wrap my loin-cloth. When Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) had finished the prayer, he said: Jabir! I said: Allahs Messenger, at thy beck and call. He said: When the cloth around you is inadequate, then tie the opposite ends but when it is small, tie it over the lower body. Jabir reported: We set out on an expedition with Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) and the only means of sustenance for every person amongst us was only one date for a day and we used to chew it. And we struck the leaves with the help of our bow and ate them until the sides of our mouths were injured. It so happened one day that a person was overlooked and not given a date. We carried that person and bore witness to the fact that he had not been given that date so he was offered that and he got up and received that. Jabir reported: We set out on an expedition along with Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) until we got down at a spacious valley and Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) went to relieve himself. I followed him with a bucket full of water and Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) looked about and he found no privacy but two trees at the end of the valley and Allahs Messenger (may. peace be upon him) went to one of them and took hold of one of its twigs and said: Be thou under my control by the permission of Allah, and so it came under his control like the camel who has its nosestring in the hand of its rider, and then he came to the second tree and took hold of a twig and said: Be thou under my control with the permission of Allah, and it came under his control, and when he came in the middle of the two trees he joined together the two twigs and said: join with the permission of Allah. Jabir said: I was afraid lest Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) should be aware of my nearness and go still farther. And Muhammad b. Abbad has used the word\" faitabd\" and I began to talk to myself. And as I saw, I suddenly found Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) before me and the two trees were separated and each one of them was standing at its place. I saw Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) standing for a short time, nodding his head towards right and left. Ismail pointed towards the right and left with the help of his head (in order to demonstrate how the Holy Prophet had pointed). Then he (the Holy Prophet) came to me and said: Jabir did you see my place where I was standing? I said: Allahs Messenger, yes. He then said: Then you should go to those two trees and cut a twig from each of them and go to that place with them where I was standing and stand there where I was standing and place a twig on the right and a twig on the left. Jabir said: I set out and took hold of a stone and broke it and sharpened it and then I came to those trees and cut a twig from each one of them. I then came dragging them until I stood at the place where Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) had been standing and placed a twig on the right and a twig on the left. Then I met him and said: Allahs Messenger, I have done that, but (kindly) explain to me the reason for it. Thereupon he said: I passed by two graves the occupants of which had been undergoing torment. I liked to make intercession for them so that the might be relieved of this torment y as long as these twigs remain fresh. Jabir said: We came back to the (camp of the) army and Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: Jabir, call people for per- forming wudu. I cried: Come and perform wudu, come and perform wudu, come and perform wudu. I said: Allahs Messenger, there is not even a drop of water in the army camp, and there. was a person who used to cool the water for Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) in the old water-skin which kept hanging by the twig. He asked me to go to such and such Ansari and ask him to see if there was any water in that skin. I went to him and cast a glance in it but did not find anything but a drop in the mouth of that water-skin and if I were to draw that, the water-skins,. dried part would suck it up. I came to Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) and said: Allahs Messenger, I have not found anything in it but a drop of water in the mouth of the water-skin and now if I were to draw that, it would be absorbed. He said: Go and bring that to me. I brought that to him. He took hold of it -and began to utter something which I could not understand and then pressed it with his hand and gave that to me and said: Jabir, announce for the tub to be brought. So I announced that the tub of the army (be brought). It was brought accordingly and I placed it before him (the Holy Prophet). Thereupon Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) placed his hands in the tub like this: with his fingers stretched out, and then he placed his fingers at the bottom of the tub and said: Jabir, take it (that waters-skin) and pour water over me, by reciting Bismillah, and I poured water and I said: Bismillah, and found water sprouting out between the fingers of Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him). Then that tub gushed forth until it was filled up and the Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: Jabir, make an announcement to the effect: He who needs water should take that. Jabir said: The people came and got water until they were all satiated. I said: Is there anyone left who wants to get it? And Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) then lifted up his hand from that tub and it was still full. Then the people made a complaint to Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) about hunger and he said: May Allah provide you food! We came to the bank of the ocean and the ocean was tossing and it threw out a big animal and we lit fire and cooked it and took it until we had eaten to our hearts content. Jabir said: I and such and such five persons entered Its socket and nobody could see us until we had come out, and we took hold of one of its ribs and twisted it into a sort of arch, then we called the tallest of the persons of the army and the hugest of the camels of the army and it had the big saddle over it, and it could easily pass through it without the rider having need to bend down.<D>(They said: In Allah we put trust.

Let's break down your concerns:\n\n### 1. The Droplet Problem and Underwear Purity (Najasah)\n\n*   **Urine is Impure (Najas):** In Islam, urine is considered an impurity (*najas*). If it touches your clothes or body, that part becomes impure and needs to be purified before you can pray.\n*   **The Toilet Paper Method:** Your current method of using toilet paper suggests that you are experiencing continued leakage even after washing.\n*   **Does it make your underwear *napaak*?** Yes, if urine (even a small amount) comes into contact with your underwear, it becomes *napaak* (impure).\n*   **Do you have to wash it?** Yes, if the impurity is present on the garment you intend to pray in, you must either wash the impure part until the impurity is removed, or change into clean clothes for prayer.\n\n**Important Nuance: *Waswasa* (Whispers of Shaytan/Obsessive Thoughts)**\n\nYou correctly identified *waswasa* as a possibility. This is crucial.\n\n*   **If it's *actual* leakage:** If you are *certain* that drops are coming out and touching your underwear after you have done your *istibra* (ensuring all urine has exited) and washed, then yes, your underwear is impure.\n*   **If it's *waswasa* (doubt/delusion):** If you have done your *istibra* properly (e.g., waited a bit, gently cleared the passage, washed) and you *doubt* if anything came out, or you *feel* something but there's no visible trace, then you should generally ignore these doubts and consider yourself pure. Excessive checking and worrying can lead to *waswasa*.\n\n**Practical Advice for *Istibra* (Ensuring No More Drops):**\n\n1.  **Wait and Clear:** After urinating, take a few moments. You can gently squeeze or pat the area just below the testicles (for men) to ensure all drops have exited. Some suggest walking a few steps or coughing lightly.\n2.  **Wash Thoroughly:** Wash the private parts with water to remove any traces of urine.\n3.  **Dry (Optional but helpful):** You can pat the area dry with a tissue or clean cloth.\n4.  **Avoid Excessive Worry:** Once you've done your best, put your trust in Allah. If you feel a drop but see nothing, or if it's just a feeling of wetness without actual impurity, dismiss it as *waswasa*.\n\n*Regarding your toilet paper method:* While it shows your earnestness, it might also be perpetuating the *feeling* of leakage. Perhaps after washing and patting dry, try *not* using toilet paper for a while and see if the drops actually appear on your underwear, or if it's mostly a mental concern. If you have a persistent medical issue with incontinence, consider consulting a doctor. For minor, known leakage, some men use a small, discreet absorbent pad placed *inside* the underwear that can be removed before prayer.\n\n### 2. Making Up for Past Prayers as Imam\n\nThis is the most sensitive part.\n\n*   **Your Own Salaah:**\n    *   If you *know* that you were impure during those prayers (i.e., you were *certain* urine had soiled your clothes and you prayed in them without purification), then you should make up those prayers yourself (*qada'*).\n    *   If you were genuinely under the impression that it was *waswasa* and you had done your best to purify, and there was no certainty of impurity, then Allah is Most Forgiving. In this case, you would seek Allah's forgiveness for any oversight, but you may not necessarily have to make up those prayers if your belief was genuinely based on dismissing *waswasa*. However, out of caution and a desire for completeness, if you have strong doubt now, it's safer to make them up yourself.\n\n*   **The *Musallis'* (Congregation's) Salaah:**\n    *   **Crucially, the prayers of the *musallis* who prayed behind you are VALID.** You do *not* have to make up their prayers, nor do they need to repeat their prayers.\n    *   **Reasoning:**\n        1.  **Imam's Hidden Imperfection:** If an Imam's prayer is invalid due to a condition that was *hidden* from the congregation (like an impurity on his clothes, or a broken *wudu* that he didn't realize until later), the prayers of the followers remain valid. They fulfilled their obligation based on what was apparent to them.\n        2.  **Prophet's Example:** There is an incident where the Prophet (peace be upon him) was leading prayer, and Jibreel (AS) informed him during the prayer that there was impurity on his shoe. He removed his shoe and continued the prayer, and he did not ask the companions to repeat their prayers. This is an indication that a hidden impurity on the Imam does not invalidate the followers' prayers.\n        3.  **Difficulty & Mercy:** Islam does not burden people beyond their capacity. It would be an immense and impossible burden to expect an Imam to track down every person who prayed behind him over years and inform them to repeat their prayers.\n\n*   **What you *should* do:**\n    1.  **Seek Allah's Forgiveness:** Make sincere *tawbah* (repentance) to Allah for any past shortcomings due to ignorance or oversight.\n    2.  **Make up your own prayers (if certain):** If you are now certain that your own prayers were invalid due to impurity, start making them up. There are different ways to do this (e.g., praying extra sunnahs with the intention of making up missed fard prayers, or dedicating specific times).\n    3.  **Focus on the Present:** Ensure your purity for all future prayers. Learn to distinguish between actual impurity and *waswasa*.\n\nMay Allah make it easy for you, forgive your past shortcomings, and accept your sincere efforts to worship Him correctly. Ameen."}

He then pointed to a room in his house in front of his room and said : My cousin (son of my uncle) was in this room. He asked his permission to go to his wife on the occasion of the battle of Troops (Ahzab), as he was recently married. The Messenger of Allah (May peace be upon him) gave him permission and ordered him to take his weapon with him. He came to his house and found his wife standing at the door of the house. When he pointed to her with the lance, she said; do not make haste till you see what has brought me out. He entered the house and found an ugly snake there. He pierced in the lance while it was quivering. He said : I do not know which of them died first, the man or the snake. His people then came to the Messenger of Allah (May peace be upon him) and said: supplicate Allah to restore our companion to life for us. He said : Ask forgiveness for your Companion. Then he said : In Medina a group of Jinn have embraced Islam, so when you see one of them, pronounce a waring to it three times and if it appears to you after that, kill it after three days.<D>Narrated Sahl bin Sa`d:A woman presented herself to the Prophet (for marriage). A man said to him, \"O Allahs Apostle! (If you are not in need of her) marry her to me.\" The Prophet said, \"What have you got?\" The man said, \"I have nothing.\" The Prophet said (to him), \"Go and search for something) even if it were an iron ring.\" The man went and returned saying, \"No, I have not found anything, not even an iron ring; but this is my (Izar) waist sheet, and half of it is for her.\" He had no Rida (upper garment). The Prophet said, \"What will she do with your waist sheet? If you wear it, she will have nothing over her; and if she wears it, you will have nothing over you.\" So the man sat down and when he had sat a long time, he got up (to leave). When the Prophet saw him (leaving), he called him back, or the man was called (for him), and he said to the man, \"How much of the Quran do you know (by heart)?\" The man replied I know such Sura and such Sura (by heart),\" naming the Suras The Prophet said, \"I have married her to you for what you know of the Quran .\"<D>Narrated Abu Huraira:Allahs Apostle said, \"Horses may be used for three purposes: For a man they may be a source of reward (in the Hereafter); for another, a means of protection; and for another, a source of sin. The man for whom they are a source of reward, is the one who keeps them for Allahs Cause and ties them with long ropes and lets them graze in a pasture or garden. Whatever those long ropes allow them to eat of that pasture or garden, will be written as good deeds for him and if they break their ropes and run one or two rounds, then all their footsteps and dung will be written as good deeds for him, and if they pass a river and drink from it though he has had no intention of watering them, even then, that will be written as good deeds for him. So such horses are a source of reward for that man. For the man who keeps horses for his livelihood in order not to ask others for help or beg his bread, and at the same time he does not forget Allahs right of what he earns through them and of their backs (that he presents it to be used in Allahs Cause), such horses are a shelter for him (from poverty). For the man who keeps them just out of pride and for showing off, they are a source of sin.\" Then Allahs Apostle was asked about donkeys. He said, \"Allah has not revealed anything to me regarding them except this comprehensive Verse: \"Then anyone who has done good, equal to the weight of an atom (or a small ant) shall see it, and any one who has done evil, equal to the weight of an atom (or a small ant) shall see it.\" (99.7-8)<D>(So Allah seized him) Allah punished him ((and made him) an example for the after (life) and for the former) the punishment that he suffered in the life of the world is drowning and the punishment of the Hereafter will be in the Fire; it is also said that this means: Allah has punished him because of his former and latter pronouncements.

May Allah ease your burdens and grant you relief.\n\nLet's address your concerns point by point, based on Islamic principles:\n\n### Understanding the Sura Jin Issue\n\n1.  **Sura Jin is part of the Quran:** First and foremost, Sura Jin (Chapter 72 of the Quran) is a noble and blessed chapter, like all other chapters of the Holy Quran. Reciting it, contemplating its meanings, and acting upon its guidance brings immense reward and spiritual benefit.\n2.  **\"Without permission\":** The concern you feel about having written/read it \"without permission\" likely stems from a misunderstanding or a specific cultural practice. In general Islam, there is no \"permission\" needed to read or write any part of the Quran for general devotion, learning, or seeking blessings. However, some specific spiritual practices or *wazaif* (recitations for particular purposes) might be prescribed by a spiritual guide (*shaykh* or scholar) who has been given authorization (*ijazah*) for that specific practice, to ensure it is done correctly, with proper intention, and without harm. If your intention was pure (e.g., to seek Allah's help, protection, or closeness), then your action was not inherently wrong.\n3.  **The \"Obstacle\" Perception:** It's very important to understand that your current difficulties (joblessness, engagement issues, health problems) are **not** directly a result of reading or writing Sura Jin. Allah is the Most Merciful and Just. He does not punish people for reciting His blessed words.\n    *   **Tests from Allah:** Life is full of tests and trials from Allah. These difficulties can be a means of expiation for sins, a way to elevate your status, or a call to turn back to Him with greater devotion.\n    *   **Misguidance of Shaytan:** Sometimes, Shaytan (Satan) whispers thoughts into our minds, making us attribute our problems to something innocent (like reciting Quran) to create despair, confusion, and distance us from Allah's words.\n    *   **Superstition:** Be careful not to fall into superstitions. Your problems are real, but their cause is not the Sura itself.\n\n### What to Do with the Written Sura Jin Paper:\n\nSince the paper contains the words of Allah, it must be treated with utmost respect.\nThe accepted ways of respectfully disposing of Quranic texts are:\n\n1.  **Dissolving in Water:** The most common and widely accepted method. Place the papers in clean, flowing water (like a river or stream, or even a bucket of clean water that will then be poured into a clean patch of earth where people don't walk) until the ink dissolves or the paper disintegrates. This ensures the words are not defiled or trampled upon.\n2.  **Burying:** Bury the papers in a clean, secluded place where people do not walk, similar to burying a deceased Muslim. Wrap them in a clean cloth before burying.\n\n**What NOT to do:**\n*   **Do not burn them:** This is generally considered disrespectful and inappropriate for Quranic text.\n*   **Do not throw them in the trash:** This is highly disrespectful.\n\n**Your intention for doing this is to show respect for Allah's words and to remove any anxiety you feel about their presence.**\n\n### Holistic Approach to Your Challenges:\n\nInstead of focusing on the past act with fear, turn your energy towards positive actions and trust in Allah. Here's a comprehensive plan:\n\n1.  **Sincere Repentance (Tawbah):**\n    *   Regardless of whether the Sura Jin act was problematic, sincere repentance is always beneficial. Ask Allah for forgiveness for any shortcomings, known or unknown, and any misinterpretations or missteps in your spiritual practices.\n    *   Say *Astaghfirullah* (I seek forgiveness from Allah) frequently.\n\n2.  **Strengthen Your Connection with Allah:**\n    *   **Salah (Prayer):** Ensure you pray all five daily prayers on time, with full concentration (khushu'). This is the most direct link to Allah.\n    *   **Dua (Supplication):** Make abundant dua. Pour out your heart to Allah, specifically asking for a job, a righteous spouse, healing for your ear, and peace of mind. Make dua especially in Sujood (prostration), after finishing your Salah, and during the last third of the night (Tahajjud).\n    *   **Recite Quran:** Continue to recite the Quran regularly, not just Sura Jin, but other Surahs as well. Seek to understand its meaning. This brings light to your heart and life.\n    *   **Dhikr (Remembrance of Allah):** Engage in frequent remembrance of Allah, e.g., \"La ilaha illallah,\" \"Subhanallah walhamdulillah wala ilaha illallah wallahu akbar,\" \"La hawla wa la quwwata illa billah\" (There is no might or power except with Allah).\n\n3.  **Perform Self-Ruqyah:**\n    *   Many of the issues you describe (joblessness, difficulty in marriage, persistent illness) are sometimes associated with 'ayn (evil eye) or sihr (magic) or just a general sense of unease. Self-Ruqyah is a powerful protection and healing method prescribed in Islam.\n    *   **How to do it:** Recite Surah Al-Fatiha, Ayatul Kursi (2:255), the last three Surahs of the Quran (Al-Ikhlas, Al-Falaq, An-Nas) onto your cupped hands and blow into them, then wipe your hands over your body. Do this morning and evening. Also, recite them directly over water and drink it, and wash with it.\n    *   **Specific Duas for healing:** Say \"Allahumma Rabban-nas, adhhibil-ba's, ishfi antash-Shafi, la shifa'a illa shifa'uk, shifa'an la yughadiru saqama\" (O Allah, Lord of mankind, remove the affliction, cure, for You are the Healer, there is no cure except Your cure, a cure that leaves no illness behind). For your ear, you can place your hand on it and recite these.\n\n4.  **Charity (Sadaqah):** Giving charity, even a small amount, purifies wealth, opens doors of blessings, and can remove obstacles.\n\n5.  **Seeking Professional Help (Medical & Career):**\n    *   **For your ear:** Continue to consult qualified medical professionals and follow their advice. Spiritual remedies are complementary to, not a replacement for, medical treatment.\n    *   **For joblessness:** Actively search for jobs, improve your skills, network, and polish your resume.\n    *   **For marriage:** Make sincere dua, seek righteous avenues for finding a spouse, and have good character.\n\n6.  **Patience (Sabr) and Trust (Tawakkul):**\n    *   Understand that Allah's plan is perfect. He is testing you, and with every hardship, there is ease. Have patience and complete trust that Allah will resolve your affairs in the best possible way and at the right time.\n\nPlease do not let despair or confusion overcome you. Your sadness is understandable, but remember that Allah is closer to you than your jugular vein. Turn to Him with hope, and He will guide you out of your difficulties.\n\nMay Allah grant you ease, health, righteous provision, and a blessed marriage. Ameen."}
{"Question": "Q: If one has any najasah on ones clothing and then one immerses oneself in a big pool etc will the clothing become pure if there is no traces left of the impurity? ? --T--", "Answer": "If the najaasat is removed, the clothing will be pure. And Allah Taala ( ) knows best", "Document": "‘Abd Allaah bin Umar said A man asked the Apostle of Allaah() What clothing one should put on if one intend to put on ihram? He said He should not wear shirts, turbans, trousers, garments with head coverings and clothing which has any dye of waras or saffron; one should not put on shoes unless one cannot get sandals. If one cannot get sandals, one should wear the shoes, in which case one must cut them to come below the ankles.<D>Narrated Abd Allaah b. Umar:Umar b. al-Khattab saw that a striped robe containing silk was being sold at the the gate of the mosque. He said: Messenger of Allah, would that you purchased it and wore it on Friday and when a delegation came to you. The Messenger of Allah () said: Only he who has no portion in the next world wears this (silk). Then the Messenger of Allah () came in possession of some robes made of silk and gave one of them to Umar b. al-Khattab. Umar said: Messenger of Allah, you are clothing me with it, but you said about the robe of Utarid what you said. The Messenger of Allah () said: I did not give it to you so that you may wear it. So Umar al-Khattab gave it to his brother who was a polytheist in Mecca to wear it.<D>Abu Huraira reported Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying:It is better that one of you should sit on live coals which would burn his clothing and come in contact with his skin than that he should sit on a grave.<D>(Nay, but verily) O Muhammad (man) i.e. the disbeliever (is rebellious) is a wanton, he moves from one position to another with regard to his food, drink, clothing and mount<D>(And were it not that mankind would have become one community) i.e. follow one religion, the religion of disbelief, (We might well have appointed, for those who disbelieve in the Beneficent, roofs) the roofs of their houses (of silver for their houses and stairs (of silver) whereby to mount) whereby to climb, <D>(The forgiveness) Allah overlooking sins (is not for those who do ill deeds until, when death attendeth upon one of them) when one of them is suffering from the agony of death, (he saith: Lo!

(For such) for the unbelievers (We have prepared a painful doom) this was revealed about Tumah and his companions who had left Islam.", "Generated_Answer": "Yes, generally, according to the majority of Islamic scholars, if one immerses clothing with *najasah* (impurity) in a large pool of water (like a significant swimming pool, lake, or river) and the impurity is completely removed such that no traces (color, smell, or physical substance) of the *najasah* remain, then the clothing becomes pure.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the reasoning:\n\n1.  **Water is a Purifier:** The fundamental principle in Islam is that water is the primary means of purification. As long as the water itself is pure, it can purify other things.\n2.  **Removal of the Impurity:** The condition for purification of clothing from *najasah 'ayniyah* (physical impurity, like urine, blood, feces) is the removal of the impurity itself and its attributes (color, smell, taste) as much as possible.\n3.  **Large Pool Status:** A large body of water, by its nature, is generally considered pure and capable of purifying, as it is difficult for a small amount of impurity to change its overall characteristics (color, smell, taste). If the impurity *does* change the water's characteristics, then that specific water becomes impure, but the question implies the pool remains pure.\n4.  **\"No Traces Left\":** This is the key. If after immersion and perhaps some agitation (rubbing the soiled area while submerged, or squeezing it to ensure water penetrates and washes out the impurity), there is no visible stain, no detectable smell, and the physical substance of the impurity is gone, then the clothing is considered pure.\n\n**Practical Considerations:**\n\n*   **Thoroughness:** Simply dipping the clothing might not be enough. You should ensure the water has thoroughly penetrated and washed away the impurity from all parts of the soiled area. Rubbing the affected area while submerged can help.\n*   **Agitation/Squeezing:** To ensure the impurity is truly washed out, it's often recommended to agitate the clothing or even squeeze it multiple times while it's submerged in the clean water.\n*   **The Pool Itself:** If the amount of *najasah* is so great that it changes the color, smell, or taste of the *entire* pool (which is highly unlikely for a large pool unless it's a massive amount), then the pool water itself would become impure. However, for typical amounts of *najasah* on clothing, a large pool will not be affected and will effectively purify the clothing.\n\nIn summary, yes, immersing clothing in a large pool will purify it, provided the impurity and its traces are completely removed."}
{"Question": "Q: Sometimes I am in situations where I am falsely accused or even penalised but in reality, I have not done anything wrong or committed any mistake or error? Is there any advice to help in these situations? ? --T--", "Answer": "If you are able to clarify the issue and in a respectful manner explain your side of the issue, then you should do so. And Allah Taala ( ) knows best", "Document": "Narrated Aisha:(the wife of the Prophet) \"Whenever Allahs Apostle intended to go on a journey, he would draw lots amongst his wives and would take with him the one upon whom the lot fell. During a Ghazwa of his, he drew lots amongst us and the lot fell upon me, and I proceeded with him after Allah had decreed the use of the veil by women. I was carried in a Howdah (on the camel) and dismounted while still in it. When Allahs Apostle was through with his Ghazwa and returned home, and we approached the city of Medina, Allahs Apostle ordered us to proceed at night. When the order of setting off was given, I walked till I was past the army to answer the call of nature. After finishing I returned (to the camp) to depart (with the others) and suddenly realized that my necklace over my chest was missing. So, I returned to look for it and was delayed because of that. The people who used to carry me on the camel, came to my Howdah and put it on the back of the camel, thinking that I was in it, as, at that time, women were light in weight, and thin and lean, and did not use to eat much. So, those people did not feel the difference in the heaviness of the Howdah while lifting it, and they put it over the camel. At that time I was a young lady. They set the camel moving and proceeded on. I found my necklace after the army had gone, and came to their camp to find nobody. So, I went to the place where I used to stay, thinking that they would discover my absence and come back in my search. While in that state, I felt sleepy and slept. Safwan bin Muattal As-Sulami Adh-Dhakwani was behind the army and reached my abode in the morning. When he saw a sleeping person, he came to me, and he used to see me before veiling. So, I got up when I heard him saying, \"Inna lil-lah-wa inn a ilaihi rajiun (We are for Allah, and we will return to Him).\" He made his camel knell down. He got down from his camel, and put his leg on the front legs of the camel and then I rode and sat over it. Safwan set out walking, leading the camel by the rope till we reached the army who had halted to take rest at midday. Then whoever was meant for destruction, fell into destruction, (some people accused me falsely) and the leader of the false accusers was `Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul. After that we returned to Medina, and I became ill for one month while the people were spreading the forged statements of the false accusers. I was feeling during my ailment as if I were not receiving the usual kindness from the Prophet which I used to receive from him when I got sick. But he would come, greet and say, How is that (girl)? I did not know anything of what was going on till I recovered from my ailment and went out with Um Mistah to the Manasi where we used to answer the call of nature, and we used not to go to answer the call of nature except from night to night and that was before we had lavatories near to our houses. And this habit of ours was similar to the habit of the old Arabs in the open country (or away from houses). So. I and Um Mistah bint Ruhm went out walking. Um Mistah stumbled because of her long dress and on that she said, Let Mistah be ruined. I said, You are saying a bad word. Why are you abusing a man who took part in (the battle of) Badr? She said, O Hanata (you there) didnt you hear what they said? Then she told me the rumors of the false accusers. My sickness was aggravated, and when I returned home, Allahs Apostle came to me, and after greeting he said, How is that (girl)? I requested him to allow me to go to my parents. I wanted then to be sure of the news through them I Allahs Apostle allowed me, and I went to my parents and asked my mother, What are the people talking about? She said, O my daughter! Dont worry much about this matter. By Allah, never is there a charming woman loved by her husband who has other wives, but the women would forge false news about her. I said, Glorified be Allah! Are the people really taking of this matter? That night I kept on weeping and could not sleep till morning. In the morning Allahs Apostle called `Ali bin Abu Talib and Usama bin Zaid when he saw the Divine Inspiration delayed, to consul them about divorcing his wife (i.e. `Aisha). Usama bin Zaid said what he knew of the good reputation of his wives and added, O Allahs Apostle! Keep you wife, for, by Allah, we know nothing about her but good. `Ali bin Abu Talib said, O Allahs Apostle! Allah has no imposed restrictions on you, and there are many women other than she, yet you may ask the woman-servant who will tell you the truth. On that Allahs Apostle called Buraira and said, O Burair. Did you ever see anything which roused your suspicions about her? Buraira said, No, by Allah Who has sent you with the Truth, I have never seen in her anything faulty except that she is a girl of immature age, who sometimes sleeps and leaves the dough for the goats to eat. On that day Allahs Apostle ascended the pulpit and requested that somebody support him in punishing `Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul. Allahs Apostle said, Who will support me to punish that person (`Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul) who has hurt me by slandering the reputation of my family? By Allah, I know nothing about my family but good, and they have accused a person about whom I know nothing except good, and he never entered my house except in my company. Sa`d bin Mu`adh got up and said, O Allahs Apostle! by Allah, I will relieve you from him. If that man is from the tribe of the Aus, then we will chop his head off, and if he is from our brothers, the Khazraj, then order us, and we will fulfill your order. On that Sa`d bin Ubada, the chief of the Khazraj and before this incident, he had been a pious man, got up, motivated by his zeal for his tribe and said, By Allah, you have told a lie; you cannot kill him, and you will never be able to kill him. On that Usaid bin Al-Hadir got up and said (to Sa`d bin Ubada), By Allah! you are a liar. By Allah, we will kill him; and you are a hypocrite, defending the hypocrites. On this the two tribes of Aus and Khazraj got excited and were about to fight each other, while Allahs Apostle was standing on the pulpit. He got down and quieted them till they became silent and he kept quiet. On that day I kept on weeping so much so that neither did my tears stop, nor could I sleep. In the morning my parents were with me and I had wept for two nights and a day, till I thought my liver would burst from weeping. While they were sitting with me and I was weeping, an Ansari woman asked my permission to enter, and I allowed her to come in. She sat down and started weeping with me. While we were in this state, Allahs Apostle came and sat down and he had never sat with me since the day they forged the accusation. No revelation regarding my case came to him for a month. He recited Tashah-hud (i.e. None has the right to be worshipped but Allah and Muhammad is His Apostle) and then said, O `Aisha! I have been informed such-and-such about you; if you are innocent, then Allah will soon reveal your innocence, and if you have committed a sin, then repent to Allah and ask Him to forgive you, for when a person confesses his sin and asks Allah for forgiveness, Allah accepts his repentance. When Allahs Apostle finished his speech my tears ceased completely and there remained not even a single drop of it. I requested my father to reply to Allahs Apostle on my behalf. My father said, By Allah, I do not know what to say to Allahs Apostle. I said to my mother, Talk to Allahs Apostle on my behalf. She said, By Allah, I do not know what to say to Allahs Apostle. I was a young girl and did not have much knowledge of the Quran. I said. I know, by Allah, that you have listened to what people are saying and that has been planted in your minds and you have taken it as a truth. Now, if I told you that I am innocent and Allah knows that I am innocent, you would not believe me and if I confessed to you falsely that I am guilty, and Allah knows that I am innocent you would believe me. By Allah, I dont compare my situation with you except to the situation of Josephs father (i.e. Jacob) who said, So (for me) patience is most fitting against that which you assert and it is Allah (Alone) whose help can be sought. Then I turned to the other side of my bed hoping that Allah would prove my innocence. By Allah I never thought that Allah would reveal Divine Inspiration in my case, as I considered myself too inferior to be talked of in the Holy Quran. I had hoped that Allahs Apostle might have a dream in which Allah would prove my innocence. By Allah, Allahs Apostle had not got up and nobody had left the house before the Divine Inspiration came to Allahs Apostle. So, there overtook him the same state which used to overtake him, (when he used to have, on being inspired divinely). He was sweating so much so that the drops of the sweat were dropping like pearls though it was a (cold) wintry day. When that state of Allahs Apostle was over, he was smiling and the first word he said, `Aisha! Thank Allah, for Allah has declared your innocence. My mother told me to go to Allahs Apostle . I replied, By Allah I will not go to him and will not thank but Allah. So Allah revealed: \"Verily! They who spread the slander are a gang among you . . .\" (24.11) When Allah gave the declaration of my Innocence, Abu Bakr, who used to provide for Mistah bin Uthatha for he was his relative, said, By Allah, I will never provide Mistah with anything because of what he said about Aisha. But Allah later revealed: -- \"And let not those who are good and wealthy among you swear not to help their kinsmen, those in need and those who left their homes in Allahs Cause. Let them forgive and overlook. Do you not wish that Allah should forgive you? Verily! Allah is Oft-forgiving, Most Merciful.\" (24.22) After that Abu Bakr said, Yes ! By Allah! I like that Allah should forgive me, and resumed helping Mistah whom he used to help before. Allahs Apostle also asked Zainab bint Jahsh (i.e. the Prophets wife about me saying, What do you know and what did you see? She replied, O Allahs Apostle! I refrain to claim hearing or seeing what I have not heard or seen. By Allah, I know nothing except goodness about Aisha.\" Aisha further added \"Zainab was competing with me (in her beauty and the Prophets love), yet Allah protected her (from being malicious), for she had piety.\"<D>Narrated Aishah:\"What was said about me had been said, and I myself was unaware of it, the Messenger of Allah () got up and addressed the people. He recited the Tashahhud and after praising and expressing gratitude to Allah, as He deserved, he said: To proceed: O people! Give me your opinion regarding those people who made a forged story against my wife. By Allah, I do not know anything bad about her at all. By Allah, they accused her of being with a man about whom I have never known anything bad, and he never entered my house unless I was present there, and whenever I went on a journey, he went with me. Sad bin Muadh [may Allah be pleased with him] got up and said: O Messenger of Allah ()! Allow me to chop their heads off! Then a man from Al-Khazraj, to whom the mother of Hassan bin Thabit was a relative, got up and said (to Sad): You have told a lie! By Allah, if those persons were from Al-Aws, you would not like to chop their heads. It was probable that some evil would take place between Aws and Khazraj in the Masjid while I was unaware of that. In the evening of that day, I went out for some of my needs, and Umm Mistah was accompanying me. On our return, Umm Mistah stumbled and said: Let Mistah be ruined! I said to her, O mother! Why do you abuse your son? On that Umm Mistah became silent for a while, and stumbling again, she said: Let Mistah be ruined! I said to her: O mother! Why do you abuse your son? She stumbled for the third time and said: Let Mistah be ruined! I said to her: O mother! Why do you abuse your son? Upon that she said: By Allah! I do not abuse him except because of you. I asked her: Concerning what of my affairs? So she disclosed the whole story to me. I said: Has this really happened? She replied: Yes, by Allah! I returned to my house, so astonished, that I did not know for what purpose I had gone out. Then I became sick and said to the Messenger of Allah () Send me to my fathers house. So he sent a servant with me, and when I entered the house, I found Umm Ruman downstairs, while Abu Bakr was reciting something upstairs. My mother asked: What has brought you, O daughter? She said: \"I informed her and mentioned the whole story to her, but she did not feel as I did about it. She said: O my daughter! Do not worry much about this matter, for there is never a charming lady loved by her husband who has other wives, but that they feel jealous of her and speak badly of her. But she did not feel the same about it as I did. I asked her: Does my father know about it? She said Yes. I asked: Does the Messenger of Allah () know about it too? She said Yes, the Messenger of Allah () also knows about it. Tears filled my eyes and I wept. Abu Bakr, who was reading upstairs, heard my voice, and came down asking my mother: What is the matter with her? She said: She has heard what has been said about her. On that Abu Bakr wept and said: I beseech you, by Allah, O my daughter, to go back to your home. I went back to my home, and the Messenger of Allah () had come to my house asking my maid-servant about me. The maid-servant said: By Allah! I do not know of any fault or defect in her character except that she sleeps and lets the sheep enter and eat her dough. On that, some of the Prophets Companions spoke harshly to her and said: Tell the truth to the Messenger of Allah (). Finally, they told her of the slander and she said: Subhan Allah! By Allah, I know nothing against her except what a goldsmith knows about a piece of pure gold. Then this news reached the man who was accused, and he said: Subhan Allah! By Allah, I have never uncovered the private parts of any woman. Later, that man was martyred in Allahs Cause. Then the next morning, my parents came to pay me a visit and they stayed with me until the Messenger of Allah () came to me, after he performed the Asr prayer. He came to me and while my parents were sitting around me on my right and my left. The Prophet () said the Tashahhud, praised and glorified Allah and said: Now then, O Aishah! If you have committed a bad deed, or you have wronged (yourself), then repent to Allah, as Allah accepts the repentance from His worshipers. An Ansari woman had come and was sitting near the gate. I said to the Prophet (): Isnt it improper that you speak in such a way in the presence of this lady? The Messenger of Allah () then gave a piece of advice and I turned to my father and requested him to reply to him. My father said: What should I say? Then I turned to my mother and asked her to answer him. She said: What should I say? When my parents did not reply to the Prophet (), I said the Tashahhud, praised and glorified Allah as His due, and I said: Then, by Allah! If I were to tell you that I have not done (this) and Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, is witness that I am telling the truth, that would not be of any use to me on your part, because you (people) have spoken about it and your hearts have absorbed it (as truth); and if I were to tell you that I have done this sin, and Allah knows that I have not done it, then you will say: She has confessed her guilt. By Allah! I do not see a suitable example for me and you except the example of - and I could not remember Yaqbus name - Yusufs father when he said: So patience is most fitting. And it is Allah Whose help can be sought against that which you describe (12:18). She said: \"It was at that time that Revelation came to the Messenger of Allah (), and we remained silent. Then the Revelation was over, and I noticed the signs of happiness on his face while he was wiping (the sweat) from his forehead, and saying: Have the good tidings O Aishah! Allah has revealed your innocence. At that time I was extremely angry. My parents said to me: Get up and go to him. I said: By Allah, I will not do it,and will not thank him nor either of you, but I will thank Allah, Who has revealed my innocence. You have heard (this story) but neither of you have denied it, nor have you changed it (to defend me).\" Aishah used to say: \"But as regards to Zainab bint Jahsh, Allah protected her because of her piety. She did not say anything except good (about me). But her sister, Hamnah was ruined among those who were ruined. Those who used to speak evil about me were Mistah, Hassan bin Thabit, and the hypocrite Abdullah bin Ubayy [bin Salul] and [it is he who] used to spread that news and tempt others to speak of it, and it was he and Hamnah who had the greater share therein. Abu Bakr took an oath that he would never do any favor for Mistah at all. Then Allah, Most High, revealed this Ayah: Let not those among you who are blessed with graces and wealth [until the end of the Ayah] referring to Abu Bakr: to give their kinsmen, the poor, and those who left their homes for Allahs Cause. - meaning Mistah - up to His saying: Do you not love that Allah should forgive you? And Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful (24:22). On that, Abu Bakr said: Yes, by Allah! O our Lord! We wish that You forgive us. So he returned to what he had been doing.\"<D>Abu Dharr reported:I went out one night (and found) the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) walking all alone. There was no man with him. I thought that he did not like anyone walking along with him. So I began to walk in the light of the moon. He, however turned his attention to me and saw me and said: Who is this? I said: It is Abu Dharr. Let Allah make me as ransom for you. He said: Abu Dharr, come on. He (Abu Dharr) said: So I walked along with him for some time and he said: The wealthy persons would have little (reward) on the Day of Resurrection, except upon whom Allah conferred goodness (wealth). He dispensed it to his right, left, in front of him and at his back (just as the wind diffuses fragrance) and did good with it (riches). I went along with him for some time when He said: Sit here. And he made me sit at a safe place and there were stones around it, and he said to me: Sit here till I come to you. He went away on the stony ground till I could not see him. He stayed away from me, and he prolonged his stay. Then I heard him as he came back and he was saying: Even if he committed theft and even if he committed fornication. When he came I could not help asking him: Apostle of Allah, let Allah make me ransom for you, whom were you speaking on the stony ground? I heard nobody responding to you. He (the Holy Prophet) said: It was Gabriel who met me by the side of the stony ground and said: Give glad tidings to your Ummah that he who died without associating ought with Allah would go into Paradise. I said: Gabriel, even if he committed theft and fornication? He said: Yes. I said: Even it he committed theft and fornication? He said: Yes, I again said: Even if he committed theft and fornication? He said: Yes, even if he drank wine.<D>(Say) to them, O Muhammad: (Be ye stones) whether you are stones or something harder (or iron) or even stronger than iron,<D>(And say: Lo! I, even I, am a plain warner) I am a messenger warning you against Allahs chastisement, in a language that you all understand,<D> (And whoso doeth good works) acts of obedience, relating to that which is between him and his Lord,(whether of male or female, and he (or she) is a believer) while being a believer who is genuine in his or her faith, (such will enter Paradise and they will not be wronged the dint in a date stone) their rewards will not be diminished even if it be by the size of the dint in a date stone.", "Generated_Answer": "It's incredibly frustrating and upsetting to be falsely accused or penalized, especially when you know you've done nothing wrong. It can feel deeply unfair and leave you feeling helpless. This is a common challenge, and navigating it requires a combination of clear strategy, emotional management, and self-advocacy.\n\nHere's advice to help you in such situations:\n\n---\n\n**I. Immediate Response (Stay Calm & Don't React Impulsively)**\n\n1.  **Do NOT Panic or React Emotionally:** Your initial reaction might be anger, shock, or defensiveness. Take a deep breath. Emotional reactions can be misinterpreted as guilt or aggression.\n2.  **Do NOT Admit Guilt (If Innocent):** Do not apologize or confess to something you didn't do, even if you feel pressured or want to de-escalate. An apology can be twisted into an admission.\n3.  **Listen Carefully & Understand the Accusation:** Before you say anything, make sure you fully grasp what you are being accused of, by whom, and when it supposedly happened. Ask clarifying questions if needed. *Example: \"Can you please be more specific about what you believe happened and when?\"*\n4.  **Do NOT Offer Unsolicited Explanations:** Only address the specific points raised. Don't volunteer information that might complicate things or make you sound defensive.\n\n---\n\n**II. Gather Information & Evidence (Build Your Case)**\n\n1.  **Document Everything (Crucial!):** As soon as possible, write down everything you remember about the accusation:\n    *   **Who:** Who accused you? Who was present?\n    *   **What:** What exactly was said or implied? What are the specific alleged actions/errors?\n    *   **When:** Date and time of the accusation and the alleged incident.\n    *   **Where:** Where did the accusation take place? Where did the alleged incident take place?\n    *   **How:** How was the accusation delivered (in person, email, meeting)?\n2.  **Collect Supporting Evidence:** Think about anything that can prove your innocence or disprove the accusation:\n    *   Emails, text messages, communication logs.\n    *   Timestamps, calendar entries, meeting invites.\n    *   Performance reviews, previous positive feedback.\n    *   Physical records, receipts, work logs.\n    *   Witnesses who can corroborate your story or provide an alibi.\n3.  **Identify Potential Witnesses:** Think of anyone who might have seen or heard something relevant, or who can vouch for your character or usual practices.\n4.  **Prepare Your Side of the Story:** Draft a clear, factual, and concise statement of events from your perspective. Stick to the facts, avoid emotional language, and be ready to present your evidence.\n\n---\n\n**III. Communicate & Advocate (Present Your Case Effectively)**\n\n1.  **Request a Formal Process (If Applicable):** In professional or formal settings (workplace, school, etc.), ask for a formal meeting or a review process according to established policies (e.g., HR, grievance procedure).\n2.  **State Your Innocence Clearly & Firmly:** When you get the opportunity, state your position without wavering. *Example: \"I understand the accusation, but I want to be very clear that I did not do [X] and I have evidence to support that.\"*\n3.  **Present Your Evidence Systematically:** Don't just list things; explain how each piece of evidence supports your defense. Offer copies of documents.\n4.  **Maintain a Respectful Demeanor:** Even if you're upset, maintain a professional and calm tone. This reinforces your credibility.\n5.  **Follow Up in Writing:** After any meeting or discussion, send a brief, factual email summarizing what was discussed, your clear denial, and any next steps agreed upon. This creates a paper trail.\n    *   *Example: \"Following our meeting on [date] regarding [accusation], I want to reiterate that I deny the allegation of [X]. As discussed, I provided [specific evidence]. Please let me know if any further information is required from my end.\"*\n\n---\n\n**IV. Seek Support (Don't Go It Alone)**\n\n1.  **Legal Counsel:** If the accusation is serious (potential job loss, criminal charges, significant financial implications, damage to reputation), consult with a lawyer specializing in the relevant area (employment law, defamation, criminal defense).\n2.  **HR/Union Representative:** If it's a workplace issue, involve your HR department or union representative. They can advise you on company policy and often act as a neutral party or advocate for you.\n3.  **Trusted Colleagues/Mentors:** If appropriate and safe, confide in a trusted colleague or mentor who understands the environment. They might offer advice, perspective, or even vouch for you. (Be careful not to gossip or badmouth, as this can backfire).\n4.  **Friends and Family:** For emotional support, talk to people who believe in you. They can help you process your feelings and provide encouragement.\n5.  **Therapist/Counselor:** If the stress and injustice are significantly impacting your mental health, professional counseling can provide coping strategies.\n\n---\n\n**V. Manage Your Emotions & Well-being**\n\n1.  **Acknowledge Your Feelings:** It's normal to feel angry, hurt, betrayed, or frustrated. Allow yourself to feel these emotions, but try not to let them dictate your actions.\n2.  **Practice Self-Care:** Engage in activities that help you de-stress: exercise, mindfulness, hobbies, spending time in nature, getting enough sleep.\n3.  **Focus on What You Can Control:** You can control your response, your actions, and your preparation. You cannot control others' perceptions or decisions.\n4.  **Don't Internalize It:** A false accusation reflects on the accuser's judgment or intentions, not on your inherent worth or integrity. Separate your identity from the accusation.\n\n---\n\n**VI. Moving Forward & Prevention**\n\n1.  **Learn from the Experience:** Once the situation is resolved (or as resolved as it can be), reflect on what happened. Were there any misunderstandings that contributed? Could you have documented something better? (This is not about self-blame, but about increasing future resilience.)\n2.  **Continue Good Documentation Habits:** Make it a habit to document key conversations, agreements, and your work.\n3.  **Build Strong Professional Relationships:** Having a good reputation and positive relationships can act as a buffer and provide support when you face false accusations.\n4.  **Consider Your Environment:** If false accusations are a recurring issue in a particular environment, it might be a sign that it's not a healthy place for you. Evaluate if it's worth staying in such a toxic environment long-term.\n\n---\n\nBeing falsely accused is a tough road, but by remaining calm, focusing on facts, advocating for yourself, and seeking appropriate support, you significantly improve your chances of clearing your name and navigating the situation successfully."}

So, he who used to worship the sun, will follow it, and he who used to worship the moon will follow it, and he who used to worship false deities will follow them; and then only this nation (i.e., Muslims) will remain, including their hypocrites. Allah will come to them in a shape other than they know and will say, I am your Lord. They will say, We seek refuge with Allah from you. This is our place; (we will not follow you) till our Lord comes to us, and when our Lord comes to us, we will recognize Him. Then Allah will come to then in a shape they know and will say, \"I am your Lord. They will say, (No doubt) You are our Lord, and they will follow Him. Then a bridge will be laid over the (Hell) Fire.\" Allahs Apostle added, \"I will be the first to cross it. And the invocation of the Apostles on that Day, will be Allahukka Sallim, Sallim (O Allah, save us, save us!), and over that bridge there will be hooks Similar to the thorns of As Sadan (a thorny tree). Didnt you see the thorns of As-Sadan?\" The companions said, \"Yes, O Allahs Apostle.\" He added, \"So the hooks over that bridge will be like the thorns of As-Sa-dan except that their greatness in size is only known to Allah. These hooks will snatch the people according to their deeds. Some people will be ruined because of their evil deeds, and some will be cut into pieces and fall down in Hell, but will be saved afterwards, when Allah has finished the judgments among His slaves, and intends to take out of the Fire whoever He wishes to take out from among those who used to testify that none had the right to be worshipped but Allah. We will order the angels to take them out and the angels will know them by the mark of the traces of prostration (on their foreheads) for Allah banned the f ire to consume the traces of prostration on the body of Adams son. So they will take them out, and by then they would have burnt (as coal), and then water, called Maul Hayat (water of life) will be poured on them, and they will spring out like a seed springs out on the bank of a rainwater stream, and there will remain one man who will be facing the (Hell) Fire and will say, O Lord! Its (Hells) vapor has Poisoned and smoked me and its flame has burnt me; please turn my face away from the Fire. He will keep on invoking Allah till Allah says, Perhaps, if I give you what you want), you will ask for another thing? The man will say, No, by Your Power, I will not ask You for anything else. Then Allah will turn his face away from the Fire. The man will say after that, O Lord, bring me near the gate of Paradise. Allah will say (to him), Didnt you promise not to ask for anything else? Woe to you, O son of Adam ! How treacherous you are! The man will keep on invoking Allah till Allah will say, But if I give you that, you may ask me for something else. The man will say, No, by Your Power. I will not ask for anything else. He will give Allah his covenant and promise not to ask for anything else after that. So Allah will bring him near to the gate of Paradise, and when he sees what is in it, he will remain silent as long as Allah will, and then he will say, O Lord! Let me enter Paradise. Allah will say, Didnt you promise that you would not ask Me for anything other than that? Woe to you, O son of Adam ! How treacherous you are! On that, the man will say, O Lord!

Narrated Ata (while Abu Huraira was narrating): Abu Sa`id was sitting in the company of Abu Huraira and he did not deny anything of his narration till he reached his saying: \"All this and as much again therewith are for you.\" Then Abu Sa`id said, \"I heard Allahs Apostle saying, This is for you and ten times as much. \" Abu Huraira said, \"In my memory it is as much again therewith. \"<D>Narrated Ibn `Abbas:The delegates of `Abdul Qais came to Allahs Apostle and said, \"The pagans of the tribe of Mudar intervene between you and us therefore we cannot come to you except in the Holy months.

Do you know what is meant by belief in Allah? It is to testify that none has the right to be worshipped except Allah, to offer prayers perfectly, to give Zakat, and to give Al-Khumus (one-fifth of the war booty) (in Allahs Cause). And I forbid you four things, (i.e., Do not drink alcoholic drinks) Ad-Dubba, An- Naqir, (pitched water skins), Az-Zuruf, Al-Muzaffat and Al--Hantam (names of utensils used for the preparation of alcoholic drinks).\" (See Hadith No. 50, Vol. 1)<D>Narrated Aisha, Ummul Muminin:AbulMalih said: Some women of Syria came to Aisha. She asked them: From whom are you? They replied: From the people of Syria. She said: Perhaps you belong to the place where women enter hot baths (for washing ). The said: Yes. She said: I heard the Messenger of Allah () say: If a woman puts off her clothes in a place other than her house, she tears the veil between her and Allah, the Exalted.Abu Dawud said: This is the tradition narrated by Jarir, and it is more perfect. Jarir did not mention Abu al-Malih. He said (on the authority of Aishah) that the Messenger of Allah () said.<D>(And even if We opened unto them) unto the people of Mecca (a Gate of Heaven) from which to enter (and they kept mounting through it) and they kept ascending and descending through it, i.e. like the angels.<D>); it is also said: they will abide in Paradise for as long as the heavens and the earth subsist: the heaven of Paradise and the earth of Paradise unless Allah wills to torment some people before making them enter Paradise, such that He puts them first in hell and then gets them out of it and puts them in Paradise, to abide therein forever: (a gift) a reward for them (unfailing) undiminished and uninterrupted.<D>(And warn them) O Muhammad (of the Day of anguish) of the Day of regret (when the case hath been decided) when the reckoning is over and the people of Paradise enter Paradise and the people of hell enter hell and Death is slain. (Now they are in a state of carelessness) in a state of ignorance and blindness concerning it, (and they believe not) in Muhammad (pbuh) in the Quran or in resurrection after death.", "Generated_Answer": "In Islam, suicide is considered a grave sin (Haram - forbidden). Life is viewed as a sacred trust from Allah, and only He has the right to give and take it.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the Islamic perspective regarding suicide and the afterlife:\n\n1.  **A Major Sin:** The Quran and Hadith strongly condemn suicide.\n    *   **Quran (An-Nisa 4:29):** \"And do not kill yourselves [or one another]. Indeed, Allah is to you ever Merciful.\"\n    *   **Hadith (Bukhari, Muslim):** The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) said: \"Whoever kills himself with a piece of iron, that iron will remain in his hand, and he will keep stabbing himself with it in the Fire of Hell, forever and ever. Whoever drinks poison and kills himself with it, he will keep sipping it in the Fire of Hell, forever and ever. Whoever throws himself from a mountain and kills himself, he will keep falling down in the Fire of Hell, forever and ever.\"\n\n2.  **The Severity and Nuance:**\n    *   **Severe Warning:** The Hadith above indicates a very severe punishment. Some scholars interpret the \"forever and ever\" not as absolute eternity for a Muslim (as only Shirk - associating partners with Allah - is definitively unforgivable if one dies without repenting from it), but as a long and painful period of punishment that fits the severity of the sin.\n    *   **Allah's Ultimate Judgment:** Ultimately, whether a person enters Jannah (Paradise) or Jahannam (Hell) is solely Allah's decision. He is Al-Ghafoor (The Forgiving) and Ar-Rahim (The Most Merciful).\n    *   **Mercy for Muslims:** A core belief in Sunni Islam is that any Muslim who dies believing in Tawhid (the Oneness of Allah) will eventually enter Jannah, even if they have to first undergo a period of punishment for their sins. Suicide, while a major sin, is generally not considered Shirk.\n    *   **Mental Health:** Many Islamic scholars and contemporary understanding recognize that individuals who commit suicide are often suffering from severe mental illnesses (like depression, psychosis, etc.) that can impair their judgment and free will. Allah does not burden a soul beyond its capacity (Quran 2:286). In such cases, there is hope that Allah, in His infinite mercy, may take into account the person's state of mind and forgive them. We cannot definitively say if such a person will go to Hell, as only Allah knows the true state of their heart and mind.\n\n3.  **What Muslims Should Do:**\n    *   **Seek Help:** Anyone struggling with suicidal thoughts should immediately seek professional help and spiritual guidance.\n    *   **Pray for the Deceased:** Despite the sin, Muslims are encouraged to pray for a deceased person who committed suicide, asking Allah for His forgiveness and mercy. The Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) did not pray the funeral prayer for a man who committed suicide as a deterrent and lesson to the community, but he allowed his companions to pray for him. This indicates that the community *can* and *should* pray for the deceased.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nWhile suicide is explicitly forbidden and considered a major sin with severe consequences warned against in Islamic texts, it is **not definitively stated** that a Muslim who commits suicide will be eternally in Hell. The ultimate judgment rests with Allah alone, who is All-Just and All-Merciful. There is hope for Allah's forgiveness, especially considering the potential role of severe mental distress."}
{"Question": "Q: I wanted to know the ruling of women growing their hair. Is keeping long hair more part of culture then religion? What is the ruling of cutting the hair? Is it permissible to keep short hair as there is a hadith which mentions that Aisha (Radiyallahu Anaha) had short hair. ? --T--", "Answer": "In matters of Deen we are commanded to follow the Fuqaha. The Fuqaha are those experts in Deen who after carrying out an extensive and comprehensive study of the Quraan, the Mubarak Ahaadith of Rasulullah (Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam) and the verdicts of the Sahaabah (with all the related sciences that are required to understand Deen), deduce the masaail of Deen and explain to the Ummah the parameters of Shariah. Hence it would be a futile exercise for the person who is not knowledgeable and completely conversant with all the above-mentioned sciences of Deen, to try to challenge their verdicts. The Fuqaha have explained in the light of Shariah that it is impermissible for a woman to cut or trim her hair. Hence, If a woman cuts her hair, she will be sinful in the court of Allah Taala.

Then she should take a piece of cotton perfumed with musk and purify herself with it.\" Asma said: \"How should I purify myself with it?\" He said: \"Subhan Allah! Purify yourself with it!\" Aishah said, as if whispering to her: \"Wipe away the traces of blood with it.\" Then she (Asma) asked him about bathing to cleanse oneself from sexual impurity. He said: \"One of you should take her water, and purify herself, and purify herself well, or thoroughly. She should pour water over her head and rub it so that the water reaches the roots of her hair, then she should pour water over her body.\" Aishah said: \"How good were the women of the Ansar!

Let's break down the rulings based on Islamic teachings.\n\n### 1. The Ruling of Women Growing Their Hair\n\nGenerally, **it is encouraged for women to grow their hair long**, as long hair is considered a natural sign of beauty and femininity in Islam. It is viewed as part of a woman's natural adornment and distinction from men.\n\n*   **No Obligation to have Extreme Length:** While long hair is preferred, there is no specific religious obligation for a woman to grow her hair to an extreme or inconvenient length (e.g., knee-length). The emphasis is on maintaining a feminine appearance.\n*   **Historical and Cultural Context:** Historically, women in many cultures, including Arab culture at the time of the Prophet (peace be upon him), traditionally kept long hair. Islam affirmed this as part of a woman's natural disposition (fitra) and beauty.\n\n### 2. Is Keeping Long Hair More Part of Culture Then Religion?\n\nThis is a nuanced point:\n\n*   **Cultural Aspect:** Yes, long hair for women has been a cultural norm in many societies for centuries, symbolizing femininity and beauty.\n*   **Religious Affirmation:** However, Islam did not simply ignore or contradict this cultural norm. Instead, it affirmed and integrated it into its teachings regarding gender roles and distinctions. The Shari'ah encourages what is generally considered feminine for women and masculine for men. Therefore, while culturally rooted, it has been **religiously validated and endorsed** as part of a woman's natural state and beauty, and as a way to distinguish them from men.\n*   **Distinction from Men (Tashabbuh bil Rijal):** One of the key principles in Islam is the prohibition of *tashabbuh bil rijal* (women imitating men) and *tashabbuh bil nisa'* (men imitating women). Hair is a significant part of this distinction. Long hair for women helps maintain this distinction.\n\n### 3. What is the Ruling of Cutting the Hair?\n\nIt is **permissible for women to cut their hair**, but with certain conditions and limitations:\n\n*   **Permissible Reasons for Cutting:**\n    *   **Health and Maintenance:** To remove split ends, dry parts, or to keep it healthy and manageable.\n    *   **Convenience:** If the hair becomes too long to manage, wash, or style easily, especially for older women.\n    *   **For Hajj/Umrah:** A small portion of hair must be trimmed at the end of Hajj or Umrah (called Taqsir).\n    *   **After Illness/Affliction:** If hair is damaged due to illness or treatment.\n*   **Prohibited Ways of Cutting:**\n    *   **Imitation of Men (Tashabbuh bil Rijal):** This is the **most important prohibition**. It is not permissible for a woman to cut her hair in a style that resembles men's hairstyles (e.g., a \"boy cut,\" a very short military style, or any style that makes her look masculine). The Prophet (peace be upon him) cursed women who imitate men and men who imitate women.\n    *   **Excessive Shortness that Loses Femininity:** Even if not a direct imitation of men, cutting it so short that it completely removes a woman's feminine appearance is generally discouraged.\n    *   **Imitation of Non-Muslims (Tashabbuh bil Kuffar):** Cutting hair in a style that is specific to or strongly associated with non-Muslim women, particularly if it's tied to their religious practices or immoral lifestyles.\n    *   **For Unlawful Display (Tabarruj):** Cutting and styling hair specifically to display it attractively to non-mahram men in an un-Islamic manner.\n    *   **Without Husband's Permission (if married):** While not explicitly prohibited, it is considered good manners and respect to consult one's husband before making a significant change to one's appearance, especially if it might affect his attraction or preference.\n\n### 4. Is It Permissible to Keep Short Hair as There is a Hadith Which Mentions That Aisha (Radiyallahu Anaha) Had Short Hair?\n\n**Yes, it is permissible to keep short hair, provided it remains distinctly feminine and does not resemble men's hairstyles.**\n\n*   **Hadith of Aisha (RA):** It is indeed narrated that `Aisha (Radiyallahu Anha) cut her hair short after the death of the Prophet (peace be upon him)`.\n    *   **Description of Aisha's Hair:** It is reported that her hair reached **just below her ears** or **up to her ears**. This was *not* a very short \"boy cut\" but rather a manageable, distinctly feminine short style.\n    *   **Reasons for Aisha's Action:** Scholars have interpreted her action in a few ways:\n        *   **Bereavement:** As a sign of her deep sorrow and detachment from adornment after the Prophet's passing.\n        *   **Manageability:** To make it easier to manage, wash, and perform ablution/ghusl, especially as she grew older and was very active in teaching and narrating Hadith.\n    *   **Scholarly Conclusion:** This Hadith is used by scholars as evidence for the permissibility of women having relatively short hair, *as long as it remains clearly feminine*. It shows that \"long hair\" is a general preference for women's beauty, but not an absolute mandate that hair must be extremely long or that *any* cutting is forbidden.\n\n### Summary:\n\n*   **Long hair is generally preferred and encouraged** for women as a sign of femininity and beauty.\n*   **Cutting hair is permissible** for women for various valid reasons (health, manageability).\n*   **The absolute prohibition is against cutting hair in a style that imitates men** or completely removes a woman's feminine appearance.\n*   **Aisha's (RA) example shows that keeping hair relatively short (e.g., to the ears/jawline, like a short bob)** is permissible, provided it retains its feminine character and does not cross the line into masculine styles.\n\nUltimately, the goal is for a Muslim woman to maintain her distinct beauty and modesty, avoiding styles that contradict Islamic principles of gender distinction and adornment."}

Bushair was a hypocrite who would recite poetry reviling the Companions of the Prophet () then he would attribute it to some of the Arabs. Then he would say: So-and-so said this and that [So-and-so said this and that]. So when the Companions of the Prophet () would hear that poetry, they would say: By Allah! No one but this filthy person said this poetry - or as the man said - and they would say: Ibn Al-Ubairiq said it.\" He said: \"They were a poor and needy household during Jahiliyyah and Islam. The only food the people of Al-Madinah had was dates and barely. When a man was able to, he would import flour from Ash-Sham which he bought and kept for himself. As for his dependants, their only food was dates and barely. So an import arrived from Ash-Sham, and my uncle Rifaah bin Zaid bought a load of it, which he put in a storage area he had, where he kept his weapons - his shield and his sword. But it was taken from him from under the house. The storage was broken into and and the food and weapons were taken. In the morning, my uncle Rifaah came to me and said: O my nephew! We were robbed during the night, our storage was broken into, and our food and weapons are gone.\" He said: \"They overheard us in the house, and questioned us, and someone said to us, We saw Banu Ubairiq cooking during the night, and it looked like they had some of your food.\" He said: \"Banu Ubairiq were saying - while we were questioning them amidst their dwellings - By Allah! We do not think the one you are looking for is other than Labid bin Sahl, a man among us who is righteous and accepted Islam. When Labid heard that, he brandished his sword and said: I stole? By Allah! You either prove this theft, or I take to you with this sword. They said: Leave us O man! You are not the one who has it. So we continued questioning in the dwellings until we had no doubt that they had taken it. So my uncle said to me: O my nephew! You should go to the Messenger of Allah () and tell him about that.\" Qatadah said: \"So I went to the Messenger of Allah () and said: A family among us are ill-mannered, and they conspired against my uncle Rifaah bin aid. They broken into his storage and took his weapons and his food. We want them to return our weapons, but we have no need for the food. So the Prophet () said: I will decide about that. So when Banu Ubairiq heard about that, they brought a man from among them named Usair bin Urwah to talk to him about that, and some people form their houses gathered and said: O Messenger of Allah! Qatadah bin An-Numan and his uncle came came to a family among us who are a people of Islam and righteousness, accusing them of stealing without proof or confirmation.\" Qatadah said: \"I went to the Messenger of Allah () and spoke to him, and he said: You went to a family among them known for their Islam and righteousness, and accused them of stealing without confirmation or proof.\" He said: \"So I returned wishing that I had lost some of my wealth, and that the Messenger of Allah () had not been spoke to about that. My uncle Rifaah came to me and said: O my nephew! What did you do? So I told him what the Messenger of Allah () said to me, so he said: It is from Allah, Whom we seek help. It was not long before the Quran was revealed: Surely, We have sent down to you the Book in truth, that you might judge between men by that which Allah has shown you, so be not a pelader for the treacherous. That is Banu Ubairiq. And seek forgiveness from Allah. [That is] from what you said to Qatadah. Certainly Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful. And argue not on behalf of those who deceive themselves. Verily, Allah does not like anyone who is a betrayer, sinner. They may hide from men, but they cannot hide from Allah for He is with them up to His saying: Most Merciful. That is: If you seek Allahs forgiveness then He will forgive you. And whoever earns sin, he earns it only against himself... up to His saying: A manifest sin. Their saying about Labid; Had it not been for the grace of Allah and His Mercy upon you... up to His saying: We shall give him a great reward. (4:105-115)\" So when the Quran was revealed, the Messenger of Allah () brought the weapon and returned it to Rifaah. Qatadah said: \"When the weapon was brought to my uncle - and he was an elderly man with bad sight\" or \"an elderly weak man\" - Abu Eisa was in doubt - \"in Jahiliyyah, and I thought that he merely had entered into Islam (without real sincerity) but when I brought it to him, he said: O my nephew! It is for Allahs cause. So I knew that his Islam was genuine. When the Quran was revealed, Bushair went with the idolaters, staying with Sulafah bint Sad bin Sumayyah. So Allah, Most High, revealed: Whoever contradicts and opposes the Messenger after the right path has been shown clearly to him, and follows other than the believers way, We shall keep him in the path he has chosen, and burn him in Hell - what an evil destination. Verily Allah forgives not associating others with Him, but He forgives what is less than that for whomever He wills. And whoever associates others with Allah, then he has indeed strayed away (4:115-116). \"When he went to stay with Sulafah, Hassan bin Thabit lampooned her with verses of poetry. So she took his saddle, put it on her head, then she left with it to cast into the valley. Then she said: You gave me the poetry of Hassan - you did not bring me any good.\"<D>Abu Hudhaifah narrated - and he was one of the companions of Abdullh bin Masüd - fromAishah who said:\"I told theProphet () about a man, so hesaid: I do not like to talk about aman, even if I were to get this orthat (for doing so).\" She said: \"Isaid: O Messenger of Allah!Safiyyah is a woman who is ...\" andshe used her hand as if to indicatethat she is short - \"So he said:You have said a statement which,if it were mixed in with the waterof the sea, it would pollute it.\"<D>Allah then went back to the talk of the jinn, saying: (And (the jinn who had listened to the Quran said): We had sought the heaven) before we accepted faith (but had found it filled with strong warders) angels (and meteors) preventing them from listening.<D>(Who, when thou readest unto him) unto al-Walid Ibn al-Mughirah (Our revelations) the Quran explaining the commands and prohibitions, (saith: (Mere) fables of the men of old) this is nothing but the lies and idle talk of the people of old.<D>(So his Lord heard his prayer and fended off their wiles from him.

", "Generated_Answer": "It's an excellent question that delves into the nuanced concept of *adab* (Islamic etiquette) and respect within the Muslim community, particularly concerning scholars.\n\nLet's break down your question:\n\n1.  **\"It is a right that (Muslim) scholars must be respected.\"**\n    Yes, this is generally true and highly encouraged in Islam. Respect for scholars stems from several points:\n    *   **Inheritors of Prophets:** The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) said, \"The scholars are the inheritors of the Prophets.\" (Abu Dawud, Tirmidhi) This highlights their crucial role in preserving and transmitting divine knowledge.\n    *   **Guardians of Knowledge:** They dedicate their lives to studying the Quran, Sunnah, and Islamic sciences, making them repositories of religious guidance.\n    *   **Guidance for the Ummah:** They serve as guides and sources of wisdom for the Muslim community, helping people understand and apply Islam in their lives.\n    *   **Quranic Basis:** The Quran elevates those who have knowledge: \"Are those who know equal to those who do not know?\" (Quran 39:9)\n\n    Therefore, showing respect to scholars is a virtue and a form of honoring knowledge itself.\n\n2.  **\"Is it haram for a layman to argue or talk back to a scholar?\"**\n    This depends entirely on the *manner* and *intention*.\n\n    *   **If \"arguing\" means being rude, arrogant, dismissive, confrontational, or trying to prove oneself superior:** Yes, this is highly inappropriate, goes against Islamic *adab*, and is blameworthy. It's not necessarily *haram* in the sense of a major sin like consuming alcohol, but it is definitely discouraged, spiritually damaging, and disrespectful to the knowledge the scholar carries. Such behavior can also hinder learning and create a negative atmosphere.\n    *   **If \"arguing\" means asking for clarification, seeking evidence, politely disagreeing based on understanding, or discussing a point to gain deeper insight:** This is **not** haram and can even be encouraged.\n        *   **Seeking Evidence:** It is the right of a Muslim to ask for the basis (dalil) of a ruling. A good scholar will welcome questions and provide evidence from the Quran and Sunnah. Blindly accepting without understanding is not always encouraged, especially for those seeking deeper knowledge.\n        *   **Scholarly Disagreement:** Throughout Islamic history, scholars have disagreed with each other, but this was almost always done with immense respect and an intention to seek the truth, not to denigrate or undermine.\n        *   **The Companions:** Even the Prophet's companions would sometimes ask for clarification or express a different initial understanding, and the Prophet (PBUH) would patiently explain. This was not considered \"talking back\" but seeking understanding.\n\n    **The key is *adab* (etiquette).** When questioning or expressing a different view, it should be done with humility, respect, and a genuine desire to learn and understand, not to challenge authority or show off.\n\n3.  **\"Not in a rude way, but in a kind of casual manner, like he would talk to friends etc.?\"**\n    This is also nuanced and depends on the specific scholar and context:\n\n    *   **Generally, maintaining a level of respect and reverence for a scholar's knowledge is important.** Treating them *exactly* like any peer might diminish the respect for their sacred knowledge and role. There's a difference between being friendly and being overly familiar in a way that disrespects their position.\n    *   **However, many contemporary scholars are very approachable and encourage a more casual, friendly interaction.** They might prefer to be seen as mentors or even friends rather than distant, unapproachable figures. In such cases, if the scholar themselves fosters this environment and does not mind, then interacting in a friendly, warm, and somewhat casual manner (while still retaining underlying respect for their knowledge) is perfectly fine and can even build stronger bonds.\n    *   **Context matters.** A formal lecture setting calls for more formal decorum, while a private conversation over tea might allow for more casual interaction.\n    *   **What kind of \"casual\"?** If \"casual\" means using respectful but friendly language, sharing jokes appropriately, or discussing everyday matters, then it's usually fine. If it means being flippant about religious matters, using disrespectful slang, or crossing boundaries of appropriate behavior, then it would be problematic.\n\n**In summary:**\n\n*   **Respect for scholars is highly valued in Islam.**\n*   **Rudeness, arrogance, or deliberate disrespect towards a scholar is blameworthy and goes against Islamic *adab*.**\n*   **Respectful questioning, seeking evidence, and polite discussion are not only permissible but often encouraged for genuine learning.**\n*   **Casual interaction, if it stems from warmth and friendship rather than disrespect, and if the scholar is comfortable with it, is generally not problematic.** Many scholars appreciate being approachable and building connections with the community.\n*   The line is crossed when the interaction, regardless of its \"casualness,\" leads to belittling the scholar's knowledge, position, or the sacredness of what they represent.\n\nAlways err on the side of showing respect and humility, and observe the scholar's own demeanor and preferences."}

When we ran out of them it became very difficult for us. We used to hit the Khabat leaves with our bows to knock them down) and swallow them, then drink water with it.

But Allah forbade them from such acts, and revealed about them: do not forbid the lawful things that Allah has permitted such as foods, drinks and having sex with your wives (and transgress not)by cutting off your male organs.

Allah loveth not transgressors) who move from the lawful to theunlawful by mutilating themselves. <D>(Hell is before him) Hell is before this arrogant person when he dies, (and he is made to drink a festering water) and he is made to drink what comes of his skin of puss and blood.<D>(Then the welcome) their food will be of Zaqqum while their drink (will be boiling water", "Generated_Answer": "It's important to approach these questions with an understanding of Islamic purity rules (*taharah*) and the nature of alcohol (*khamr*) in Islamic jurisprudence.\n\nMost classical Islamic scholars consider *khamr* (wine, and by extension other intoxicants) to be ritually impure (*najis*) in its essence (*najis 'ayni*), similar to blood or urine. Some contemporary scholars, and a minority of classical scholars (like Imam al-Muzani, a student of Imam Shafi'i, and later Imam Ibn Taymiyyah), hold the view that alcohol is *haram* (forbidden to consume) but not *najis* in its essence, meaning its physical presence doesn't necessitate ritual washing unless there's a visible stain or it's consumed.\n\nHowever, for the purpose of being cautious and following the majority opinion, we will proceed with the understanding that alcohol is *najis*.\n\n---\n\n### Q: 1. If after consuming alcohol a person drinks a soft drink and then drinks water from the bottle, can we render the water pure to consume.\n\n**A: It is generally advised to avoid consuming water from a bottle that has been used in this manner, as its purity becomes questionable.**\n\nHere's the breakdown:\n\n1.  **Alcohol Consumption:** When a person consumes alcohol, their mouth becomes contaminated with a ritually impure substance (according to the majority view).\n2.  **Soft Drink:** Drinking a soft drink afterward might dilute some of the alcohol residue, but it does not necessarily cleanse the mouth completely of the impurity. Traces of alcohol could still remain.\n3.  **Drinking Water from the Bottle:** When the person then drinks from the bottle, their contaminated mouth comes into direct contact with the rim of the bottle. This can transfer the impurity from their mouth to the bottle's rim. If the water inside the bottle touches the contaminated rim, or if any backwash from the person's mouth goes into the bottle, the water itself can become contaminated and thus considered impure (*najis*).\n\n**Conclusion:** Due to the potential transfer of impurity from the mouth to the bottle and then to the water, it is safer and more cautious to consider the water in that bottle as impure (*najis*) and therefore not pure to consume, especially if you are particular about ritual purity for prayer or consumption.\n\n**Recommendation:** If someone has consumed alcohol, they should thoroughly rinse their mouth multiple times with clean water (like performing *madmadah* for wudu) before drinking from a shared bottle to minimize the risk of contamination. Ideally, they should use a separate glass or cup.\n\n---\n\n### Q: 2. If a family member is alcoholic how can a person keep pure for prayers as far as utensils and house is concerned. Does he have to keep cleaning?\n\n**A: You need to exercise reasonable care to maintain purity, but there's no need for excessive or obsessive cleaning that causes undue hardship.**\n\nHere's how to approach it:\n\n1.  **Utensils:**\n    *   **The Rule:** If a family member who has just consumed alcohol uses a utensil (plate, cup, spoon, fork), and their mouth (which is impure from alcohol) comes into contact with it, then that utensil becomes impure (*najis*).\n    *   **Cleaning:** These utensils **must be washed thoroughly with water and soap** before being used by others, especially for consumption. Simple washing is sufficient; there's no need for specific purification rituals like washing with soil (which is typically reserved for dog saliva).\n    *   **Practicality:** If possible, consider having specific utensils for the family member who consumes alcohol, which can be washed separately immediately after use. This minimizes the risk to others. If not, ensure thorough washing of all shared utensils.\n\n2.  **House (Surfaces):**\n    *   **The Rule:** The house itself does not become impure by default simply because an alcoholic lives there. Purity is only affected if the impurity (alcohol) comes into direct contact with a surface.\n    *   **Specific Impurities:**\n        *   **Spills:** If alcohol is spilled on the floor, table, or furniture, the area where it spilled becomes impure. This area should be cleaned immediately with water until the impurity (color, smell, trace) is removed. Wiping with a wet cloth is often sufficient for surfaces.\n        *   **Vomit/Saliva (with alcohol residue):** If the person vomits or heavily salivates onto a surface after drinking, that area also becomes impure and needs to be cleaned with water.\n        *   **Contact with Wet Impurity:** If the alcoholic's hand or body, wet with alcohol, touches a surface, that surface becomes impure and needs cleaning.\n    *   **General Surfaces:** Doorknobs, remote controls, chairs, etc., that are generally dry and haven't had direct contact with wet alcohol are considered pure. You do not need to constantly clean every surface in the house out of fear unless there's a clear indication of impurity.\n    *   **Clothing:** If the alcoholic's clothes are visibly stained with alcohol, they are impure and should be washed before performing prayers in them. If your clothes come into contact with their dry clothes, they do not become impure.\n\n**Key Principles and Advice:**\n\n*   **Avoid Obsession (Waswas):** Islam does not burden a person beyond their capacity. Do not fall into excessive cleaning or *waswas* (religious obsessive-compulsive disorder) where you imagine impurity everywhere. Clean what is known or highly likely to be impure.\n*   **Intention:** Your intention to maintain purity for prayer is important. Allah understands the difficulties of your situation.\n*   **Patience and Dua:** This is a challenging situation. Be patient, continue to make *dua* (supplication) for your family member's guidance, and focus on maintaining your own spiritual well-being.\n*   **Focus on the Known:** Only clean areas that have definitely come into contact with the impure substance. Unseen or highly unlikely transfers of impurity do not make something impure.\n\nIn summary, for utensils, a thorough wash after use by the alcoholic is necessary. For the house, clean only the areas that have been visibly soiled or clearly contaminated by the alcohol itself. There's no need for constant, general cleaning of the entire house."}

Tell I me of a sign whereby I will recognize the place. \" `Amr said to me, Allah said, \"That place will be where the fish will leave you.\" Ya`la said to me, \"Allah said (to Moses), Take a dead fish (and your goal will be) the place where it will become alive. \" So Moses took a fish and put it in a basket and said to his boy-servant \"I dont want to trouble you, except that you should inform me as soon as this fish leaves you.\" He said (to Moses).\" You have not demanded too much.\" And that is as mentioned by Allah: And (remember) when Moses said to his attendant ....  (18.60) Yusha` bin Noon. (Sa`id did not state that). The Prophet said, \"While the attendant was in the shade of the rock at a wet place, the fish slipped out (alive) while Moses was sleeping. His attend an said (to himself), \"I will not wake him, but when he woke up, he forgot to tell him The fish slipped out and entered the sea. Allah stopped the flow of the sea. where the fish was, so that its trace looked as if it was made on a rock. `Amr forming a hole with his two thumbs an index fingers, said to me, \"Like this, as in its trace was made on a rock.\" Moses said \"We have suffered much fatigue on this journey of ours.\" (This was not narrated by Sa`id). Then they returned back and found Al-Khadir. `Uthman bin Abi Sulaiman said to me, (they found him) on a green carpet in the middle of the sea. Al-Khadir was covered with his garment with one end under his feet and the other end under his head. When Moses greeted, he uncovered his face and said astonishingly, Is there such a greeting in my land? Who are you? Moses said, I am Moses. Al- Khadir said, Are you the Moses of Bani Israel? Moses said, Yes. Al-Khadir said, \"What do you want? Moses said,  I came to you so that you may teach me of the truth which you were taught. Al- Khadir said, Is it not sufficient for you that the Torah is in your hands and the Divine Inspiration comes to you, O Moses? Verily, I have a knowledge that you ought not learn, and you have a knowledge which I ought not learn. At that time a bird took with its beak (some water) from the sea: Al-Khadir then said, By Allah, my knowledge and your knowledge besides Allahs Knowledge is like what this bird has taken with its beak from the sea. Until, when they went on board the boat (18.71). They found a small boat which used to carry the people from this sea-side to the other sea-side. The crew recognized Al-Khadir and said, The pious slave of Allah. (We said to Sa`id \"Was that Khadir?\" He said, \"Yes.\") The boat men said, We will not get him on board with fare. Al-Khadir scuttled the boat and then plugged the hole with a piece o wood. Moses said, Have you scuttle it in order to drown these people surely, you have done a dreadful thing. (18.71) (Mujahid said. \"Moses said so protestingly.\") Al-Khadir said, didnt I say that you can have no patience with me? (18.72) The first inquiry of Moses was done because of forget fullness, the second caused him to be bound with a stipulation, and the third was done he intentionally. Moses said, Call me not to account for what I forgot and be not hard upon me for my affair (with you). (18.73) (Then) they found a boy and Al-Khadir killed him. Ya`la- said: Sa`id said They found boys playing and Al-Khadir got hold of a handsome infidel boy laid him down and then slew him with knife. Moses said, Have you killed a innocent soul who has killed nobody (18.74) Then they proceeded and found a wall which was on the point of falling down, and Al-Khadir set it up straight Sa`id moved his hand thus and said Al-Khadir raised his hand and the wall became straight. Ya`la said, I think Sa`id said, Al-Khadir touched the wall with his hand and it became straight (Moses said to Al-Khadir), If you had wished, you could have taken wages for it. Sa`id said, Wages that we might had eaten. And there was a king in furor (ahead) of them\" (18.79) And there was in front of them. Ibn `Abbas recited: In front of them (was) a king. It is said on the authority of somebody other than Sa`id that the king was Hudad bin Budad. They say that the boy was called Haisur. A king who seized every ship by force. (18.79) So I wished that if that boat passed by him, he would leave it because of its defect and when they have passed they would repair it and get benefit from it. Some people said that they closed that hole with a bottle, and some said with tar. His parents were believers, and he (the boy) was a non-believer and we(Khadir) feared lest he would oppress them by obstinate rebellion and disbelief. (18.80) (i.e. that their love for him would urge them to follow him in his religion, so we (Khadir) desired that their Lord should change him for them for one better in righteousness and near to mercy (18:81). This was in reply to Moses saying: Have you killed an innocent soul.? (18.74). Near to mercy\" means they will be more merciful to him than they were to the former whom Khadir had killed. Other than Sa`id, said that they were compensated with a girl.

Let's break it down:\n\n1.  **Ritual Impurity (Janabah) vs. Physical Impurity (Najasa):**\n    *   **Janabah:** After intimate relations, a person is in a state of major ritual impurity (janabah). This means they cannot pray, touch the Quran, circumambulate the Kaaba, etc., until they perform Ghusl (the full ritual bath). This state *does not* mean your entire body is physically \"dirty\" or \"impure\" in the sense of carrying physical najasa (like urine, feces, blood, or semen) all over it.\n    *   **Najasa:** This refers to specific physical impurities like semen, urine, feces, blood, etc. If these substances are on your body, clothes, or a surface, they need to be cleaned.\n\n2.  **Your Hand After Intimate Relations:**\n    *   If your hand did not directly touch any semen or other najasa, then your hand itself is not considered physically impure. Even though you are in a state of janabah, your hand is not \"najis\" in the sense that it would contaminate everything it touches.\n    *   If, however, your hand *did* directly come into contact with semen (which is generally considered najis by most scholars), then the semen on your hand is a physical impurity that needs to be cleaned.\n\n3.  **Cleaning a Surface (e.g., Table) Touched by Your Hand:**\n\n    *   **Scenario 1: No semen or other najasa was on your hand when you touched the table.**\n        *   In this case, the table is **not impure**. There is no physical najasa transferred. You don't need to wipe it at all for Islamic purity purposes.\n\n    *   **Scenario 2: Semen (or other najasa) was on your hand and transferred to the table.**\n        *   Semen is generally considered najis (impure). If it gets on a surface, that surface becomes impure.\n        *   **How to clean it:** The general principle for cleaning najasa from a hard, non-porous surface (like a table) is to remove the substance itself and its traces (color, smell).\n        *   **One wipe vs. Three wipes:**\n            *   There is no specific requirement for three times in this case. If **one thorough wipe** with a wet cloth or tissue completely removes the semen and its traces, then the place is clean.\n            *   If the first wipe doesn't completely remove it (e.g., it smears or leaves a residue), then you would wipe again until it is completely gone. The goal is the *removal of the impurity*, not a specific number of wipes. The \"three times\" is often related to washing limbs in Wudu' or Ghusl, or sometimes for specific types of impurities (like dog saliva, which requires seven washes, one with earth).\n\n**In summary:**\n\n*   Your hand itself is not inherently \"impure\" just because you are in a state of janabah, unless it has actual najasa (like semen) on it.\n*   If your hand had no semen on it, the table is not impure.\n*   If semen was on your hand and transferred to the table, then you need to clean the table. **One thorough wipe** with a wet cloth or tissue that effectively removes the semen is sufficient to make the table clean. You only need to wipe more times if necessary to ensure all traces of the impurity are gone.\n\nIt is always recommended to perform Ghusl as soon as possible after intimate relations to become ritually pure for prayer and other acts of worship."}

The rulings are based on the maximum and minimum durations for menstruation (haidh) and purity (tuhr).\n\nMost Islamic schools of thought agree on the following general principles:\n\n1.  **Minimum duration of Haidh:** Usually 1 day and 1 night (24 hours) or 3 days (depending on the madhhab).\n2.  **Maximum duration of Haidh:** Usually 15 days (common in Hanafi and Shafi'i schools). Some schools like Hanbali and Maliki may say 10 days, but 15 days is a widely accepted maximum.\n3.  **Minimum duration of Tuhr (purity between two periods):** 15 days. If the purity is less than 15 days, the bleeding is often considered a continuation of the previous haidh or istihaadhah.\n\nLet's break down her situation:\n\n**Analysis of Her Situation:**\n\n*   **No Haidh for over a year:** This indicates her regular cycle is severely disrupted, if not completely absent. She is not a \"mu'tadah\" (woman with a regular habit) in the conventional sense currently.\n*   **Two months ago: Bleeding for 7 days.** This 7-day period is well within the normal range for haidh, so it can be considered a valid menstrual period.\n*   **Clean for 18 days.** This 18-day purity period is valid as it is more than the minimum 15 days of purity required between two distinct haidh periods. This confirms the previous 7-day bleeding was a separate haidh.\n*   **After 18 days, continuous brown discharge for almost a month (approx. 30 days).** This is the crucial part. Brown discharge is generally considered blood and can be part of haidh.\n\n**Ruling for Her Current State (the continuous brown discharge):**\n\nBased on the maximum duration of haidh (15 days) and the fact that she had a valid period of purity (18 days) before this new bleeding started:\n\n*   **Haidh:** The first **15 days** of this continuous brown discharge should be regarded as Haidh. During these 15 days, she is in a state of menstruation.\n*   **Istihaadhah:** All the days **after** these initial 15 days of continuous brown discharge should be regarded as Istihaadhah (non-menstrual bleeding).\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nSince the maximum duration for haidh is 15 days, any bleeding beyond this limit, when it occurs continuously without a break of at least 15 days of purity, is considered istihaadhah. Her body has effectively reset after the 18 days of purity, making the new continuous flow a fresh \"cycle.\"\n\n**Ruling if She Remains in This State for a Few Months:**\n\nIf she continues to experience this pattern (long periods of bleeding with short or no purity breaks for a few months), the general principle remains the same:\n\n*   **Each new period of continuous bleeding, that follows at least 15 days of complete purity, will have its first 15 days counted as Haidh.**\n*   **All bleeding beyond those 15 days (within that continuous flow) will be Istihaadhah.**\n\n**However, if she *never* achieves 15 days of purity and bleeds almost continuously for months on end (e.g., stops for a day or two then starts again, or just continuous for 30+ days, then a couple of days clean, then another 30+ days bleeding), then she would be considered a \"Mustahaadah\" (a woman suffering from continuous irregular bleeding).**\n\nIn such a long-term continuous state:\n\n*   **Distinguishing Haidh from Istihaadhah:** If she cannot distinguish (e.g., if the blood color/consistency is always the same and she never has clear purity breaks of 15 days), she may revert to a common duration of haidh, such as 6 or 7 days (as this is a common menstrual period length), considering those days as her haidh for each \"lunar month,\" and the rest as istihaadhah. This is a common approach for a \"Mutahayyira\" (confused woman) in some schools of thought.\n*   **Practical Approach (Most Lenient for Mustahaadah):**\n    *   She should perform **Ghusl (ritual bath)** once at the time of Fajr prayer for her first prayer of the day (or whenever she intends to pray after her haidh has passed, and she is in a state of istihaadah).\n    *   For every subsequent prayer, she needs to perform **Wudu (ablution)**. She can perform one Wudu for the time of Dhuhr prayer and pray Dhuhr and Asr with that same Wudu if she does not invalidate it by anything *other than* the discharge. Similarly, for Maghrib and Isha. (Some scholars even allow one wudu for each prayer time, regardless of whether she prays multiple prayers in one time).\n    *   She should wear a sanitary pad to prevent the discharge from soiling her clothes.\n    *   **All acts of worship are permissible during istihaadhah:** She can pray, fast, read Quran (even touching the Mus'haf), and her husband can have intimacy with her. She is considered ritually pure despite the bleeding.\n\n**Summary for Her:**\n\n1.  **For the current continuous brown discharge:**\n    *   **First 15 days:** Regard as Haidh (no prayer, fasting, etc.).\n    *   **Days after the 15th day (up to the current time):** Regard as Istihaadhah (perform Ghusl/Wudu and pray, fast, etc.).\n2.  **If this pattern continues for months:** The principle of 15 days maximum haidh after 15 days minimum purity applies. If she never gets 15 days of purity, she becomes a Mustahaadah. In this case, she should determine her haidh (e.g., 6 or 7 days at the beginning of each lunar month or based on a previous reliable habit if she had one) and consider the rest as istihaadhah, performing all acts of worship with necessary purity for each prayer time.\n\n**Important Note:** This is general fiqh guidance. It's highly recommended for her to consult with a reliable local female scholar or Imam, especially if this condition persists and severely impacts her worship or daily life, as they can provide more specific guidance tailored to her situation and the madhhab she follows. It is also advisable to consult a doctor to rule out any underlying medical conditions."}

Let's break down your questions:\n\n1.  **Feeling Body Heat from Proximity (No Contact):**\n    *   **Ruling:** No, feeling someone's body heat from proximity *without any physical contact* does **not** necessitate Musahara, even if one feels lust at that moment.\n    *   **Explanation:** The establishment of Musahara due to lust requires **physical contact** (malamasa or musahaha) with the body of the other person. The definition of \"touching through a barrier but body heat can be felt\" implies that the barrier is so thin that the sensation of the body (its warmth, softness, etc.) is transmitted directly through it, making it akin to direct contact.\n    *   However, merely feeling the radiant heat from someone who is in close proximity but *not touching* you (e.g., sitting very close but not touching, or standing behind someone and feeling their warmth) is not considered \"touching\" (malamasa) in the fiqh sense. The heat you feel in this scenario is being radiated through the air, not transmitted through physical contact with their body.\n    *   Therefore, since there was no physical contact, the condition for Musahara is not met.\n\n2.  **Degree of Lust Required:**\n    *   **Ruling:** The restriction applies with a specific level of lust, which is generally understood as more than just a fleeting thought or general attraction, but often does **not** require a full erection (intishar).\n    *   **Explanation:**\n        *   **For Men:** Most jurists from the Hanafi school (which is often cited for these rulings) define the \"lust\" (shahwa) required to establish Musahara as a noticeable physiological response. This includes:\n            *   **Movement of the penis:** A slight movement, hardening, or a partial erection (intishar) is generally considered sufficient. It does not necessarily need to be a full, complete erection, but there must be a tangible physical manifestation of arousal beyond mere mental contemplation.\n            *   If there is no physical response (no hardening, no movement), even if one feels an inner sense of attraction, it is generally not sufficient to establish Musahara.\n        *   **For Women:** For a woman, the indication of lust (shahwa) is usually described as a strong inclination of the heart, a noticeable feeling of desire, or an increase in her physical excitement.\n    *   **Key Point:** The lust must be present *at the time of the physical contact*. If lust arises *after* the contact has ceased, it does not establish Musahara.\n\n**In Summary:**\n\n*   **No physical contact = No Musahara from lust.** Feeling radiated body heat without touching does not count as physical contact.\n*   **Lust for Musahara** requires a noticeable physiological response (e.g., slight hardening/movement for a male, strong inclination/excitement for a female), which is more than just a general feeling of attraction, but often less than a full erection.\n\nIt's crucial to remember that these are very serious matters with significant implications for marriage, and interpretations can sometimes vary between madhahib (schools of thought) and individual scholars. For a definitive ruling on a personal case, it is always best to consult directly with a qualified Islamic scholar who can understand the specific details and provide guidance."}

Let's break down your questions:\n\n### 1. Is it a sin to touch pork?\n\nNo, it is **not a sin** to touch pork in Islam. The sin is in consuming it (eating it).\n\nHowever, pork is considered *najis* (ritually impure) in Islam. This means that if you touch it, especially if it's wet, your hands (or whatever body part/clothing touched it) become impure. This impurity does not make you \"sinful,\" but it means you would need to wash your hands thoroughly (with soap and water) before performing acts of worship like prayer (Salah) or touching the Quran.\n\nThink of it like this: If you touch something dirty, your hands become dirty. You need to wash them to clean them, but touching dirt itself isn't a sin. Similarly, touching pork makes your hands impure, requiring washing, but it's not an act of sin in itself.\n\n### 2. Is my pay haram if I serve haram meat?\n\nThis is a more nuanced question and there are different scholarly perspectives on it, especially in situations where a job involves both halal and haram aspects.\n\n**General Islamic Principle:** Earning money from *haram* activities (like selling alcohol, interest, or pure pork products exclusively) is *haram*. Aiding in sin is also generally discouraged and can be problematic.\n\n**Applying to Your Situation (Mixed Environment):**\n\n*   **The Stricter View:** Many scholars would advise against working in an environment where you are directly involved in serving haram meat, even if halal options are also present. Their reasoning is that by serving haram meat, you are directly facilitating or assisting in something forbidden. From this perspective, the entire salary could be considered problematic (either entirely haram or at least tainted/doubtful). They would advise seeking an alternative job that is entirely free from such issues.\n*   **The More Lenient/Necessity View:** Some scholars, especially when considering situations of genuine necessity (e.g., you cannot find any other job to support yourself or your family), might say that if the primary business is not *solely* haram, and you are also involved in serving halal items, the portion of your pay that comes from serving halal items or general permissible duties (like cleaning, taking orders for drinks/sides) would be permissible. However, they would still emphasize that directly handling and serving the haram meat is disliked (makrooh) or problematic, and you should try to minimize your involvement in those specific tasks if possible. They would still strongly encourage looking for alternative employment.\n\n**Summary and Advice for You:**\n\n1.  **Touching Pork:** Not a sin, but wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water after handling it, especially before prayer.\n2.  **Your Pay:**\n    *   **Ideally:** It is best to avoid working in an environment where you are directly involved in serving haram items. Strive to find a job that is purely halal, as this removes all doubt and brings greater blessings (barakah).\n    *   **If you must stay (for now):**\n        *   Try to minimize your direct involvement with pork or other haram meats. See if you can focus more on preparing/serving halal items, taking orders, cleaning, or other tasks that don't involve the haram meat. This might not always be possible in a fast-food setting.\n        *   Make sincere *dua* (supplication) to Allah to open doors for you to find a better, purely halal job.\n        *   Save up money and actively search for other employment opportunities that align fully with Islamic principles.\n\nIn conclusion, while touching pork is not a sin, the act of serving haram meat is problematic in Islam. It's considered either *haram* (forbidden) or at least *makrooh* (disliked/reprehensible) due to facilitating a forbidden act. Therefore, the income derived from such a mixed job carries a degree of doubt (*shubuhat*). It's always best to strive for purely halal earnings.\n\nMay Allah make it easy for you to find a job that is completely pleasing to Him."}

It was said to him: O Messenger of Allah, what do you think of the fat of dead animals, for it is used to caulk ships, it is daubed on animal skins and people use it to light their lamps?

During a Ghazwa of his, he drew lots amongst us and the lot fell upon me, and I proceeded with him after Allah had decreed the use of the veil by women. I was carried in a Howdah (on the camel) and dismounted while still in it. When Allahs Apostle was through with his Ghazwa and returned home, and we approached the city of Medina, Allahs Apostle ordered us to proceed at night. When the order of setting off was given, I walked till I was past the army to answer the call of nature. After finishing I returned (to the camp) to depart (with the others) and suddenly realized that my necklace over my chest was missing. So, I returned to look for it and was delayed because of that. The people who used to carry me on the camel, came to my Howdah and put it on the back of the camel, thinking that I was in it, as, at that time, women were light in weight, and thin and lean, and did not use to eat much. So, those people did not feel the difference in the heaviness of the Howdah while lifting it, and they put it over the camel. At that time I was a young lady. They set the camel moving and proceeded on. I found my necklace after the army had gone, and came to their camp to find nobody. So, I went to the place where I used to stay, thinking that they would discover my absence and come back in my search. While in that state, I felt sleepy and slept. Safwan bin Muattal As-Sulami Adh-Dhakwani was behind the army and reached my abode in the morning. When he saw a sleeping person, he came to me, and he used to see me before veiling. So, I got up when I heard him saying, \"Inna lil-lah-wa inn a ilaihi rajiun (We are for Allah, and we will return to Him).\" He made his camel knell down. He got down from his camel, and put his leg on the front legs of the camel and then I rode and sat over it. Safwan set out walking, leading the camel by the rope till we reached the army who had halted to take rest at midday. Then whoever was meant for destruction, fell into destruction, (some people accused me falsely) and the leader of the false accusers was `Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul. After that we returned to Medina, and I became ill for one month while the people were spreading the forged statements of the false accusers. I was feeling during my ailment as if I were not receiving the usual kindness from the Prophet which I used to receive from him when I got sick. But he would come, greet and say, How is that (girl)? I did not know anything of what was going on till I recovered from my ailment and went out with Um Mistah to the Manasi where we used to answer the call of nature, and we used not to go to answer the call of nature except from night to night and that was before we had lavatories near to our houses. And this habit of ours was similar to the habit of the old Arabs in the open country (or away from houses). So. I and Um Mistah bint Ruhm went out walking. Um Mistah stumbled because of her long dress and on that she said, Let Mistah be ruined. I said, You are saying a bad word. Why are you abusing a man who took part in (the battle of) Badr? She said, O Hanata (you there) didnt you hear what they said? Then she told me the rumors of the false accusers. My sickness was aggravated, and when I returned home, Allahs Apostle came to me, and after greeting he said, How is that (girl)? I requested him to allow me to go to my parents. I wanted then to be sure of the news through them I Allahs Apostle allowed me, and I went to my parents and asked my mother, What are the people talking about? She said, O my daughter! Dont worry much about this matter. By Allah, never is there a charming woman loved by her husband who has other wives, but the women would forge false news about her. I said, Glorified be Allah! Are the people really taking of this matter? That night I kept on weeping and could not sleep till morning. In the morning Allahs Apostle called `Ali bin Abu Talib and Usama bin Zaid when he saw the Divine Inspiration delayed, to consul them about divorcing his wife (i.e. `Aisha). Usama bin Zaid said what he knew of the good reputation of his wives and added, O Allahs Apostle! Keep you wife, for, by Allah, we know nothing about her but good. `Ali bin Abu Talib said, O Allahs Apostle! Allah has no imposed restrictions on you, and there are many women other than she, yet you may ask the woman-servant who will tell you the truth. On that Allahs Apostle called Buraira and said, O Burair. Did you ever see anything which roused your suspicions about her? Buraira said, No, by Allah Who has sent you with the Truth, I have never seen in her anything faulty except that she is a girl of immature age, who sometimes sleeps and leaves the dough for the goats to eat. On that day Allahs Apostle ascended the pulpit and requested that somebody support him in punishing `Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul. Allahs Apostle said, Who will support me to punish that person (`Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul) who has hurt me by slandering the reputation of my family? By Allah, I know nothing about my family but good, and they have accused a person about whom I know nothing except good, and he never entered my house except in my company. Sa`d bin Mu`adh got up and said, O Allahs Apostle! by Allah, I will relieve you from him. If that man is from the tribe of the Aus, then we will chop his head off, and if he is from our brothers, the Khazraj, then order us, and we will fulfill your order. On that Sa`d bin Ubada, the chief of the Khazraj and before this incident, he had been a pious man, got up, motivated by his zeal for his tribe and said, By Allah, you have told a lie; you cannot kill him, and you will never be able to kill him. On that Usaid bin Al-Hadir got up and said (to Sa`d bin Ubada), By Allah! you are a liar. By Allah, we will kill him; and you are a hypocrite, defending the hypocrites. On this the two tribes of Aus and Khazraj got excited and were about to fight each other, while Allahs Apostle was standing on the pulpit. He got down and quieted them till they became silent and he kept quiet. On that day I kept on weeping so much so that neither did my tears stop, nor could I sleep. In the morning my parents were with me and I had wept for two nights and a day, till I thought my liver would burst from weeping. While they were sitting with me and I was weeping, an Ansari woman asked my permission to enter, and I allowed her to come in. She sat down and started weeping with me. While we were in this state, Allahs Apostle came and sat down and he had never sat with me since the day they forged the accusation. No revelation regarding my case came to him for a month. He recited Tashah-hud (i.e. None has the right to be worshipped but Allah and Muhammad is His Apostle) and then said, O `Aisha! I have been informed such-and-such about you; if you are innocent, then Allah will soon reveal your innocence, and if you have committed a sin, then repent to Allah and ask Him to forgive you, for when a person confesses his sin and asks Allah for forgiveness, Allah accepts his repentance. When Allahs Apostle finished his speech my tears ceased completely and there remained not even a single drop of it. I requested my father to reply to Allahs Apostle on my behalf. My father said, By Allah, I do not know what to say to Allahs Apostle. I said to my mother, Talk to Allahs Apostle on my behalf. She said, By Allah, I do not know what to say to Allahs Apostle. I was a young girl and did not have much knowledge of the Quran. I said. I know, by Allah, that you have listened to what people are saying and that has been planted in your minds and you have taken it as a truth. Now, if I told you that I am innocent and Allah knows that I am innocent, you would not believe me and if I confessed to you falsely that I am guilty, and Allah knows that I am innocent you would believe me. By Allah, I dont compare my situation with you except to the situation of Josephs father (i.e. Jacob) who said, So (for me) patience is most fitting against that which you assert and it is Allah (Alone) whose help can be sought. Then I turned to the other side of my bed hoping that Allah would prove my innocence. By Allah I never thought that Allah would reveal Divine Inspiration in my case, as I considered myself too inferior to be talked of in the Holy Quran. I had hoped that Allahs Apostle might have a dream in which Allah would prove my innocence. By Allah, Allahs Apostle had not got up and nobody had left the house before the Divine Inspiration came to Allahs Apostle. So, there overtook him the same state which used to overtake him, (when he used to have, on being inspired divinely). He was sweating so much so that the drops of the sweat were dropping like pearls though it was a (cold) wintry day. When that state of Allahs Apostle was over, he was smiling and the first word he said, `Aisha! Thank Allah, for Allah has declared your innocence. My mother told me to go to Allahs Apostle . I replied, By Allah I will not go to him and will not thank but Allah. So Allah revealed: \"Verily! They who spread the slander are a gang among you . . .\" (24.11) When Allah gave the declaration of my Innocence, Abu Bakr, who used to provide for Mistah bin Uthatha for he was his relative, said, By Allah, I will never provide Mistah with anything because of what he said about Aisha. But Allah later revealed: -- \"And let not those who are good and wealthy among you swear not to help their kinsmen, those in need and those who left their homes in Allahs Cause. Let them forgive and overlook. Do you not wish that Allah should forgive you? Verily! Allah is Oft-forgiving, Most Merciful.\" (24.22) After that Abu Bakr said, Yes ! By Allah! I like that Allah should forgive me, and resumed helping Mistah whom he used to help before. Allahs Apostle also asked Zainab bint Jahsh (i.e. the Prophets wife about me saying, What do you know and what did you see? She replied, O Allahs Apostle! I refrain to claim hearing or seeing what I have not heard or seen. By Allah, I know nothing except goodness about Aisha.\" Aisha further added \"Zainab was competing with me (in her beauty and the Prophets love), yet Allah protected her (from being malicious), for she had piety.\"<D>(And those who look not for a meeting with Us) those who do not believe in resurrection after death, i.e. Abu Jahl and his host (say: Why are angels not sent down unto us) to inform us that Allah sent you to us (and (why) do we not see our Lord) to ask Him about you? (Assuredly they think too highly of themselves) to simply believe; it is also said that this means: they think too highly of themselves when they ask to see Allah, (and are scornful with great pride) refusing to believe; it is also said that they dared to ask for a tremendous thing when they asked for the angels to come to them.<D>(Allah hath decreed: Lo! I verily shall conquer, I and My messengers) i.e. Muhammad (pbuh) they shall conquer Persia, Byzantium, the hypocrites and the Jews. (Lo! Allah is Strong) through giving help to his prophets, (Almighty) in retribution against His enemies. This was revealed about Abdullah Ibn Ubayy Ibn Salul who said to the true believers: Do you really think that you shall conquer Persia and Byzantium?.<D>(Then said: Lo! I feel sick!) so that they leave him alone. ", "Generated_Answer": "It sounds like you're going through a very challenging and confusing time, and it takes immense courage to articulate these feelings. Feeling misunderstood or sensing negative perceptions from others, especially when you don't know why, can be incredibly isolating and damaging to one's self-esteem. The guilt, the self-dislike of your own behavior, and the low self-worth are clear signs that you're struggling, and it's absolutely natural to seek help and guidance.\n\nFrom an Islamic perspective, this situation can be approached with a combination of spiritual fortification, internal reflection, and practical steps. Allah (SWT) is the ultimate source of comfort and guidance, and His wisdom provides immense peace in times of confusion.\n\nHere's a comprehensive approach you can take Islamically:\n\n**I. Spiritual Fortification & Connection with Allah:**\n\n1.  **Increase Your Du'a (Supplication):** This is your most powerful tool. Pour your heart out to Allah, who knows exactly what you're feeling even if you can't articulate it perfectly.\n    *   **For anxiety/sadness/low self-esteem:**\n        *   \"**Allahumma inni a'udhu bika min al-hammi wal-hazan, wal-'ajzi wal-kasal, wal-bukhli wal-jubn, wa dal'id-dayni wa ghalabatir-rijal.**\" (O Allah, I seek refuge in You from anxiety and sorrow, weakness and laziness, miserliness and cowardice, the burden of debts and from being overpowered by men.)\n        *   \"**La ilaha illa Anta Subhanaka inni kuntu minaz-zalimin.**\" (None has the right to be worshipped but You. Glorified are You. Truly, I was among the wrongdoers.) - This is Yunus (AS)'s du'a, powerful for distress.\n        *   \"**Ya Hayyu Ya Qayyumu, bi rahmatika astagheeth, aslih li sha'ni kullahu, wa la takilni ila nafsi tarfata 'ayn.**\" (O The Ever Living, O The Sustainer, by Your Mercy I seek help, rectify for me all of my affairs and do not leave me to myself even for the blink of an eye.)\n    *   **For protection from people's negativity/evil eye/envy:**\n        *   Recite **Ayat al-Kursi** (Quran 2:255) daily, especially before sleeping and after prayers. It's a great protection.\n        *   Recite **Surah Al-Ikhlas, Al-Falaq, and An-Nas** three times in the morning and evening, and before sleeping. These are powerful for protection against all evils, including envy and ill-will from others.\n        *   \"**Bismillahil-ladhi la yadurru ma'as-mihi shay'un fil-ardi wa la fis-sama'i wa Huwas-Sami'ul-'Aleem.**\" (In the Name of Allah with Whose Name nothing can cause harm on earth or in the heavens, and He is the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing.) - Recite three times morning and evening.\n    *   **For self-love and acceptance:**\n        *   \"**Allahumma inni as'aluka al-huda, wat-tuqa, wal-'afafa, wal-ghina.**\" (O Allah, I ask You for guidance, piety, chastity, and contentment.) - Contentment includes contentment with oneself.\n\n2.  **Consistent Salah (Prayer):** Your five daily prayers are your direct connection to Allah. Pray with presence of heart, focusing on the meaning of what you're saying. Salah brings immense peace and clarity. Make extra voluntary prayers (Nawafil) like Duha and Witr.\n\n3.  **Recite and Reflect on the Quran:** The Quran is a healing for what is in the breasts. Read it, ponder its meanings, and let its words soothe your heart. The stories of the prophets and their trials can offer solace and perspective.\n\n4.  **Dhikr (Remembrance of Allah):** Engaging in constant remembrance of Allah helps to keep your heart alive and protected.\n    *   \"**La hawla wa la quwwata illa billah.**\" (There is no might or power except with Allah.) - This is a treasure from Paradise and helps when you feel powerless.\n    *   **Istighfar (Seeking Forgiveness):** \"Astaghfirullah.\" (I seek Allah's forgiveness.) - Regularly seeking forgiveness cleanses the heart, removes burdens, and opens doors to Allah's mercy. Sometimes, our own internal struggles can be due to sins we are unaware of or have forgotten.\n\n**II. Internal Reflection & Mindset Shift (Based on Islamic Principles):**\n\n1.  **Focus on Allah's Pleasure, Not People's:** This is paramount. The Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) taught, \"Whoever seeks the pleasure of Allah, even if it displeases people, Allah will be pleased with him and will make the people pleased with him. And whoever seeks the pleasure of people, even if it displeases Allah, Allah will be displeased with him and will make the people displeased with him.\" (Tirmidhi)\n    *   Your worth is defined by Allah, not by fluctuating human opinions.\n    *   People's perceptions are often based on their own biases, insecurities, or misunderstandings, not necessarily on anything you've done.\n\n2.  **Tawakkul (Reliance on Allah):** Trust that Allah is in control and will guide you through this. Do your part (du'a, good deeds) and then leave the outcome to Him.\n\n3.  **Husn ad-Dhann (Good Assumption):**\n    *   **About others:** While it feels like people have negative feelings, try to give them the benefit of the doubt where possible. Perhaps their \"strange look\" is due to their own problems, or their \"behavior\" is misinterpreted.\n    *   **About yourself (in relation to Allah):** Believe that Allah loves you and wants good for you. He would not burden you with something you cannot bear.\n\n4.  **Gentle Self-Assessment (Without Blame):** Ask yourself, purely for self-improvement and seeking Allah's pleasure:\n    *   Are there any habits or behaviors I have (even unintentional) that might genuinely be off-putting to some? (e.g., poor communication, being overly critical, unintentional arrogance, etc.) If so, identify them and work on them for Allah's sake.\n    *   Am I projecting my own insecurities onto others? Sometimes, our internal struggles can make us misinterpret external cues.\n    *   *Important:* This is not about self-blame, but about self-awareness for growth. If you genuinely find no logical reason, then release the guilt.\n\n5.  **Understand Hasad (Envy) and Evil Eye:** In Islam, we acknowledge that some people may genuinely harbor envy or ill-will, which can manifest in negative energy or even the evil eye. The spiritual protections mentioned above are crucial for this.\n\n**III. Practical Steps for Well-being:**\n\n1.  **Surround Yourself with Positive People:** Seek out friends or family members who genuinely uplift you, listen to you, and see the good in you. Limit interaction with those who consistently make you feel worse about yourself.\n\n2.  **Engage in Good Deeds (Ihsan):** Helping others, being kind, giving charity, smiling – these acts bring immense internal peace, earn rewards from Allah, and often lead to positive interactions with people. When you focus on giving, you become less focused on what you're receiving (or not receiving) from others.\n\n3.  **Develop Your Skills and Hobbies:** Engaging in activities you enjoy and are good at can significantly boost your self-esteem and give you a sense of accomplishment, independent of others' opinions.\n\n4.  **Mind Your Body:** Ensure you're getting enough sleep, eating healthy, and engaging in some form of physical activity. Your physical well-being heavily impacts your mental and emotional state.\n\n5.  **Seek Professional Help (If Needed):** If these feelings are overwhelming, persistent, and severely impacting your daily life, please consider talking to a qualified therapist or counselor who can provide tools and strategies to manage your thoughts and emotions. There is no shame in seeking professional help; it is an act of taking care of the amanah (trust) of your body and mind that Allah has given you.\n\n**Remember:**\n\n*   **Patience (Sabr):** This process of healing and growth takes time. Be patient with yourself and with the process.\n*   **Allah's Love:** Know that Allah loves you more than your own mother. He knows your struggles and your sincerity.\n*   **You are Not Alone:** Many people experience similar feelings of confusion, low self-worth, and social anxiety.\n\nFocus on your relationship with Allah, purify your intentions, strive for good character, and trust that Allah will make a way out for you and grant you peace. Insha'Allah, with these steps, you will find clarity, inner peace, and a stronger sense of self-worth."}

The fire of ignorance is inquiry.

", "Generated_Answer": "Alhamdulillah that your *istibraa* process is effective and no drops are coming out before you apply water. This shows your diligence and care for purity.\n\nThe feeling you describe *after* washing yourself or having a bath is a very common experience, especially for those who are meticulous about their purity for prayer. This sensation is almost always **not actual urine drops**, but rather one of the following:\n\n1.  **Residual Water:** When you wash, water can get into crevices or cling to the skin and hair around the private area. As you move or dry yourself, this water can trickle out, feeling very much like a drop of urine.\n2.  **Muscle Relaxation:** The warmth of water and the act of washing can cause the muscles in the pelvic area to relax, which might create a sensation that feels like something is exiting, even if nothing is.\n3.  ***Waswasa* (Whispers of Shaytan):** This is the most significant factor. Shaytan knows the importance of purity in Islam and loves to instill doubt (*waswasa*) in a believer's mind to make worship difficult or even abandoned. He makes you feel drops, even when there are none, to make you think your *wudu* or *ghusl* is broken, leading to excessive washing, redoing *wudu*, and anxiety.\n\n**What You Should Do:**\n\nThe general Islamic principle regarding doubt and certainty is: **Certainty is not removed by doubt (*al-yaqeen la yazulu bish-shakk*)**. You were certain that no drops came out after your *istibraa*. This certainty is not nullified by a mere feeling or doubt.\n\nHere's the practical advice:\n\n1.  **Ignore the Feeling Completely:** This is the most crucial step. Unless you see, smell, or are absolutely *certain* (beyond any doubt) that actual urine has come out, you must treat that feeling as *waswasa* and ignore it.\n2.  **Do Not Re-Wash or Re-Do Wudu:** If you act upon this feeling by washing again or redoing your *wudu*, you are feeding the *waswasa* and it will only become stronger.\n3.  **Trust Your *Istibraa*:** You have already performed *istibraa* and confirmed no drops are coming out. Trust this process. Your body is clean and pure after washing.\n4.  **Focus on Your Worship:** Redirect your attention from these doubts to your prayer or other acts of worship. Remind yourself that Allah does not burden a soul beyond its capacity, and He has made Islam easy. He knows your effort to be pure.\n5.  **Dry Thoroughly (Optional, for Peace of Mind):** After washing, you can try to dry yourself thoroughly with a clean towel to minimize residual water, though even this might not stop the *feeling* if it's primarily *waswasa*.\n6.  **Seek Refuge in Allah:** When these thoughts or feelings come, say \"A'oodhu billahi minash-shaytanir-rajeem\" (I seek refuge in Allah from the accursed Shaytan).\n\n**In Summary:**\n\nYou are experiencing a common form of *waswasa* related to purity. Your *istibraa* is effective. **Do not pay attention to the feeling of drops after washing with water.** Assume you are pure, proceed with your *wudu* (if applicable), and pray. The more you ignore these whispers, the weaker they will become, by Allah's will.\n\nMay Allah make it easy for you and protect you from the whispers of Shaytan."}

And his servant too had a Maafiri mantle over him. My father said to him: My uncle, I see the signs of anger or that of agony on your face. He said: Yes, such and such person, the son of so and so, of the tribe of Harami owed me a debt. I went to his family, extended salutations and said: Where is he? They said: He is not here. Then came out to me his son who was at the threshold of his youth. I said to him: Where is your father? He said: No sooner did he hear your sound than he hid himself behind my mothers bedstead. I said to him: Walk out to me, for I know where you are. He came out. I said to him: What prompted you to hide yourself from me? He said: By God, whatever I would say to you would not be a lie. By Allah, I fear that I should tell a lie to you and in case of making promise with you I should break it, as you are the Companion of Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him). The fact is that I was hard up in regard to money. I said: Do you adjure by Allah? He said: I adjure by Allah. I said: Do you adjure by Allah? He said: I adjure by Allah. I said: Do you adjure by Allah? He said: I adjure by Allah. Then he brought his promissory note and he wrote off (the debt) with his hand and said: Make payment when you find yourself solvent enough to pay me back; if you are not, then there is no liability upon you. These two eyes of mine saw, and he (AbuI-Yasar) placed his fingers upon his eyes and these two ears of mine heard and my heart retained, and he pointed towards his heart that Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: He who gives time to one who is financially hard up (in the payment of debt) or writes off his debt, Allah will provide him His shadow. I said to him: My uncle, if you get the cloak of your servant and you give him your two clothes, or take his two clothes of Maafir and give him your cloak, then there would be one dress for you and one for him. He wiped my head and said: O Allah, bless the son of my brother. O, son of my brother, these two very eyes of mine saw and these two ears of mine listened to and this heart of mine retained this, and he pointed towards the heart that Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: Feed them (the servants) and clothe them (the servants) what you wear, and if I give him the goods of the world, it is easy for me than this that he should take my virtues on the Day of Resurrection. We went on till we came to Jabir b. Abdullah in the mosque and he was busy in observing prayer in one cloth which he had joined at its opposite ends. I made my way through the people till I sat between him and the Qibla and I said: May Allah have mercy upon you. Do you observe prayer with one cloth on your body whereas your mantle is lying at your side? He pointed me with his hand towards my breast just like this and he separated his fingers and bent them in the shape of a bow. And (he said): I thought that a fool like you should come to me so that he should see me as I do and he should then also do like it. Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) came to us in this very mosque and he had in his hand the twig of the palm-tree and he saw mucus towards the Qibla of the mosque and he erased it with the help of the twig. He then came to us and said: Who amongst you likes that Allah should turn His face away from him? We were afraid. He then again said: Who amongst you likes that Allah should turn His face away from him? We were afraid. He again said: Who amongst you likes that Allah should turn His face away from him? We said: Allahs Messenger, none of us likes it. And he said: If one amongst you stands for prayer, Allah, the Exalted and Glorious, is before him he should not spit in front of him, or on his right side, but should spit on his left side beneath his left foot and if he is impelled to do so all of a sudden (in spite of himself) he should then spit in his cloth and fold it in some part of it. (and he further said: ) Bring some sweet-smelling thing. A young man who belonged to our tribe stood up, went and brought scent in his palm. Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) took that and applied it to the end of that twig and then touched the place where there had been mucus. Jabir said: This is why you should apply scent to your mosques. It is reported on the same authority: We set out along with Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) on an expedition of Batn Buwat. He (the Holy Prophet) was in search of al-Majdi b. Amr al-Juhani. (We had so meagre equipment) that five. six or seven of us had one camel to ride and so we mounted it turn by turn. Once there wan. the turn of an Ansari to ride upon the camel. He made it kneel down to ride over it (and after having. mounted it), he tried to raise it up but it hesitated. So he said. May there be curse of Allah upon you! Thereupon Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: Who is there to curse his camel? He said: Allahs Messenger, it is I. Thereupon he said: Get down from the camel and let us not have in our company the cursed one. Dont curse your own selves, nor your children. nor your belongings. There is the possibility that your curse may synchronies with the time when Allah is about to confer upon you what you demand and thus your prayer may be readily responded. It is reported on the same authority: We set out on an expedition along with Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) until it was evening, and we had been near a. water reservoir of Arabia. Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: Who would be the person who would go ahead and set right the reservoir and drink water himself and serve us with it? Jabir said: I stood up and said: Allahs Messenger, it is I who am ready to do that. Thereupon Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: Who is the person to accompany Jabir? And then Jabbar b. Sakhr stood up. So we went to that well and poured in that tank a bucket or two of water and plastered it with clay and then began to fill it (with water) until it was filled to the brim. Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) was the first who appeared before us, and he said: Do you (both) permit me to drink water out of it? We said: Yea, Allahs Messenger. He led his camel to drink water and it drank. He then pulled its rein and it stretched its legs and began to urinate. He then took it aside and made it kneel down at another place and then came to the tank and performed ablution. I then got up and performed ablution like the ablution of Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him), and Jabbar b. Sakhr went in order to relieve himself and Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) got up to observe prayer and there was a mantle over me. I tried to invert its ends but it was too short (to cover my body easily). It had its borders. I then inverted it (the mantle) and drew its opposite ends and then tied them at my neck. I then came and stood upon the left side of Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him). He caught hold of me and made me go round behind him, until he made me stand on his right side. Then Jabbar b. Sakhr came. He performed ablution and then came and stood on the left side of Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him). Then Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) caught hold of our hands together, pushed us back and made us stand behind him. Then Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) began to look upon me with darting looks, but I did not perceive that. After that I became aware of it and he pointed with the gesture of his hand that I should wrap my loin-cloth. When Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) had finished the prayer, he said: Jabir! I said: Allahs Messenger, at thy beck and call. He said: When the cloth around you is inadequate, then tie the opposite ends but when it is small, tie it over the lower body. Jabir reported: We set out on an expedition with Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) and the only means of sustenance for every person amongst us was only one date for a day and we used to chew it. And we struck the leaves with the help of our bow and ate them until the sides of our mouths were injured. It so happened one day that a person was overlooked and not given a date. We carried that person and bore witness to the fact that he had not been given that date so he was offered that and he got up and received that. Jabir reported: We set out on an expedition along with Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) until we got down at a spacious valley and Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) went to relieve himself. I followed him with a bucket full of water and Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) looked about and he found no privacy but two trees at the end of the valley and Allahs Messenger (may. peace be upon him) went to one of them and took hold of one of its twigs and said: Be thou under my control by the permission of Allah, and so it came under his control like the camel who has its nosestring in the hand of its rider, and then he came to the second tree and took hold of a twig and said: Be thou under my control with the permission of Allah, and it came under his control, and when he came in the middle of the two trees he joined together the two twigs and said: join with the permission of Allah. Jabir said: I was afraid lest Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) should be aware of my nearness and go still farther. And Muhammad b. Abbad has used the word\" faitabd\" and I began to talk to myself. And as I saw, I suddenly found Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) before me and the two trees were separated and each one of them was standing at its place. I saw Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) standing for a short time, nodding his head towards right and left. Ismail pointed towards the right and left with the help of his head (in order to demonstrate how the Holy Prophet had pointed). Then he (the Holy Prophet) came to me and said: Jabir did you see my place where I was standing? I said: Allahs Messenger, yes. He then said: Then you should go to those two trees and cut a twig from each of them and go to that place with them where I was standing and stand there where I was standing and place a twig on the right and a twig on the left. Jabir said: I set out and took hold of a stone and broke it and sharpened it and then I came to those trees and cut a twig from each one of them. I then came dragging them until I stood at the place where Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) had been standing and placed a twig on the right and a twig on the left. Then I met him and said: Allahs Messenger, I have done that, but (kindly) explain to me the reason for it. Thereupon he said: I passed by two graves the occupants of which had been undergoing torment. I liked to make intercession for them so that the might be relieved of this torment y as long as these twigs remain fresh. Jabir said: We came back to the (camp of the) army and Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: Jabir, call people for per- forming wudu. I cried: Come and perform wudu, come and perform wudu, come and perform wudu. I said: Allahs Messenger, there is not even a drop of water in the army camp, and there. was a person who used to cool the water for Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) in the old water-skin which kept hanging by the twig. He asked me to go to such and such Ansari and ask him to see if there was any water in that skin. I went to him and cast a glance in it but did not find anything but a drop in the mouth of that water-skin and if I were to draw that, the water-skins,. dried part would suck it up. I came to Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) and said: Allahs Messenger, I have not found anything in it but a drop of water in the mouth of the water-skin and now if I were to draw that, it would be absorbed. He said: Go and bring that to me. I brought that to him. He took hold of it -and began to utter something which I could not understand and then pressed it with his hand and gave that to me and said: Jabir, announce for the tub to be brought. So I announced that the tub of the army (be brought). It was brought accordingly and I placed it before him (the Holy Prophet). Thereupon Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) placed his hands in the tub like this: with his fingers stretched out, and then he placed his fingers at the bottom of the tub and said: Jabir, take it (that waters-skin) and pour water over me, by reciting Bismillah, and I poured water and I said: Bismillah, and found water sprouting out between the fingers of Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him). Then that tub gushed forth until it was filled up and the Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: Jabir, make an announcement to the effect: He who needs water should take that. Jabir said: The people came and got water until they were all satiated. I said: Is there anyone left who wants to get it? And Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) then lifted up his hand from that tub and it was still full. Then the people made a complaint to Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) about hunger and he said: May Allah provide you food! We came to the bank of the ocean and the ocean was tossing and it threw out a big animal and we lit fire and cooked it and took it until we had eaten to our hearts content. Jabir said: I and such and such five persons entered Its socket and nobody could see us until we had come out, and we took hold of one of its ribs and twisted it into a sort of arch, then we called the tallest of the persons of the army and the hugest of the camels of the army and it had the big saddle over it, and it could easily pass through it without the rider having need to bend down.<D>It wasnarrated from Anas bin Malik that the Prophet () said:“Whoeverperforms ablution on Friday, it is well and good for him, andhe hasdone what is obligatory for him. But whoever takes a bath, bathisbetter.”<D>Nafi’ said It was Ibn ‘Umar’s habit that whenever he came to Makkah he spent the night at Dhu Tuwa in the morning he would take a bath and enter Makkah in the daytime. He used to say the Prophet () had done so.<D> (Who set some other god along with Allah) they acknowledge different other gods along with Allah. (Butthey will come to know) what will be done with them. Allah destroyed, in the span of one night and oneday, each one of them by means of a different torment. These were five in number, among them was al-As Ibn Wail al-Sahmi who was stung by something and died on the spot, may Allah keep him far from His mercy. And among them was al-Harth Ibn Qays al-Sahmi who ate salted fish which made him very thirsty. He drank so much water that his stomach burst open and he died, may Allah ruin him. And among themwas al-Aswad Ibn Abd al-Muttalib whose head Gabriel banged on a tree and then hit his face with thorns until he died, may Allah curse him. And among them is al-Aswad Ibn Abd Yaghuth who left his house in an extremely hot day and was caught by the simoom such that his colour turned black and resembled an Abyssinian. He went back to his house, but they refused to open the door for him. He banged the door with his head so hard that he died, may Allah forsake him. And among them was al-Walid Ibn al-Mughirah al- Makhzumi who died as a result of an arrow which grazed his anklebone, may Allah banish him. All these people used to say before they died: the Lord of Muhammad (pbuh) has killed me.<D>Allah then taught them what they ought to learn in their dealings, saying: (O ye who believe!) in Allah and His Messenger (when ye contract a debt for a fixed term, record it) i.e. the debt (in writing. Let a scribe record it in writing between you) the indebted person and the creditor (in (terms of) equity) justice. (No scribe should refuse to write) the contract between the creditor and the debtor (as Allah hath taught him) how to write, (so let him write) the contract without addition or omission, (and let him who incurreth the debt dictate) i.e. the indebted person should explain to the scribe the debt he owes, (and let him observe his duty to Allah his Lord) let the indebted person fear his Lord, (and diminish naught thereof) and not diminish any amount of debt he owes upon dictation. (But if he who oweth the debt is of low understanding) is ignorant of dictation, (or weak) unable to dictate, (or unable himself to dictate) does not know how to dictate to the scribe, (then let the guardian of his interests dictate) the guardian of his wealth who is the creditor (in (terms of) equity) without any addition. (And call to witness) for your rights, (from among your men, two witnesses) from among your free, Muslim men who are of good character. (And if two men be not (at hand) then a man and two women, of such as ye approve as witnesses) from among people who are reliable in their witness, (so that if the one erreth (through forgetfulness)) so that if one of the women forgets (the other) who did not forget (will remind her. And the witnesses must not refuse) togive witness (when they are summoned) to court. (Be not averse) disinclined (to writing down) i.e. the debt(whether it be small or great, with (record of) the term thereof. That) i.e. that which I mentioned regarding the writing down of the debt (is more equitable) more correct and fairer (in the sight of Allah and more sure for testimony) clearer for the witness when he gives his testimony if he happens to forget, (and the bestway of avoiding doubt between you) concerning the debt and the fixed term of its payment; (save only inthe case when it is actual merchandise which you transfer among yourselves from hand to hand. In that case it is no sin) there is no harm (for you if ye write it not) the transaction. (And have witnesses when ye sell one to another) on credit, (and let no harm be done to scribe) by committing the transaction to writing (or witness) by giving his witness, that is, do not coerce them to do so. (If ye do (harm to them)) if you harm them, (lo! It is a sin in you. Observe your duty to Allah) fear Allah for causing such harm. (Allah is teaching you) what is best for you regarding your dealings. (And Allah is Knower of all things) what is good for you as well as other things.<D>Then the following was revealed about Abdullah Ibn Umayyah al-Makhzumi and his companions who said to the Prophet: make the mountains disappear by means of your Quran; or make springs gush out of them, just as David did with the fount of copper, as you claim; or bring for us a wind by means of which we travel to Historic Syria and return, just as it was done by Solomon, according to you; or bring our dead to life asdid Jesus, as you claim. So Allah said: (Had it been possible for a Lecture) other than the Quran which has been revealed to Muhammad (pbuh) (to cause the mountains to move) by means of which mountains are made to disappear from the face of the earth, (or the earth to be torn asunder) by means of which to travel long distances, (or the dead to speak) or by means of which the dead are brought back to life, the Quran which was revealed to Muhammad (pbuh) would have done so. (Nay, but Allahs is the whole command) rather, Allah can do all these things, if He wills. (Do not those who believe) in Muhammad (pbuh) and in the Quran (know that had Allah willed, He could have guided all mankind)?) if he willed, He would have honoured all mankind with His religion (As for those who disbelieve) in the Scriptures and messengers, i.e. the disbelievers of Mecca, (disaster) a military detachment; and it is said this means: a thunderbolt (ceaseth not to strike them because of what they do) in their state of disbelief, (or it dwelleth near) or make camp with your Companions near (their home) near their city Mecca, in Usfan (until the threat of Allah) the Conquest of Mecca (come to pass. Lo! Allah faileth not to keep the tryst) i.e. the Conquest of Mecca; as it is said this means: resurrection after death.", "Generated_Answer": "It is a common concern regarding the direction of the Qibla during various activities. Let's break down the ruling regarding ghusl:\n\n**Is it acceptable to face or back the Qibla during Ghusl?**\n\nGenerally, yes, it is acceptable, and there is no sin in doing so.\n\nHere's a more detailed explanation:\n\n1.  **Distinction from Answering the Call of Nature:** The strictest rulings regarding facing or backing the Qibla apply to answering the call of nature (using the toilet). In this scenario, it is generally disliked (makruh tahrimi) or even forbidden in open spaces to face or back the Qibla. However, in enclosed buildings, with a wall or partition between oneself and the Qibla, many scholars permit it out of necessity, while still considering it better to avoid if possible.\n\n2.  **Ghusl is Not Worship:** Ghusl, while a ritual purification, is a private act and not an act of worship in itself like Salah (prayer). Therefore, the strictness applied to prayer or answering the call of nature does not apply to ghusl.\n\n3.  **Preferred Practice (Adab/Mustahab):** While not forbidden, out of respect for the Qibla (which is the direction of prayer and the Kaaba, the House of Allah), it is considered *better* or *more respectful* (mustahab/adab) to avoid facing or backing it if it is easily possible to do so. This is a matter of etiquette and showing reverence to a sacred direction.\n\n**What can be done about it?**\n\n*   **If it's unavoidable:** If your bathtub is fixed and the layout of your bathroom makes it impossible or very difficult to avoid backing the Qibla, then **do not worry at all**. You are not committing any sin, and your ghusl will be valid. Allah understands the practicalities of modern homes.\n*   **If there's flexibility:** If there's any slight flexibility in your position within the tub, or if you could slightly angle your body to avoid directly backing the Qibla, you could do so as a matter of showing extra respect. However, this is often impractical in a standard bathtub.\n*   **Focus on Intention:** Your intention to perform ghusl purely for Allah's sake and to purify yourself is paramount. If you are doing so out of necessity due to the bathroom's layout, there is absolutely no issue.\n\n**In summary:**\n\nYou can perform your ghusl without concern. While it's generally preferred to avoid facing or backing the Qibla out of respect when easily possible, it is not forbidden during ghusl, especially when the bathroom layout makes it unavoidable. Your ghusl will be valid and complete."}
{"Question": "Q: A Hadith tells us that men should wear their trousers above their ankles. What do the four Imams says regarding wearing of the trousers above ankles, is there any difference of opinion? ? --T--", "Answer": "All are unanimous that it should be worn above the ankles. And Allah Taala ( ) knows best", "Document": "Ibn Abbas (Allah be pleased with both of them) reported:I heard Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) say as he was delivering an address: So far as the trousers are concerned, one who does not find lower garment, he may wear them; as also socks, he may wear them who does not find shoes. It concerns the Muhrim.<D>Narrated `Abdullah bin `Umar:A man said, \"O Allahs Apostle. What type of clothes should a Muhrim wear Allahs Apostle replied, Do not wear shirts, turbans trousers hooded cloaks or Khuffs (socks made from thick fabric or leather); but if someone cannot get sandals, then he can wear Khuffs after cutting them short below the ankles. Do not wear clothes touched by saffon or wars (two kinds of perfumes).<D>‘Abd Allaah bin Umar said that he heard the Apostle of Allaah() prohibiting women in the sacred state (wearing ihram) to wear gloves, veil(their faces) and to wear clothes with dye of waras or saffron on them. But afterwards they can wear any kind of clothing they like dyed yellow or silk or jewelry or trousers or shirts or shoes.Abu Dawud said ‘Abdah and Muhammad bin Ishaq narrated this tradition from Muhammad bin Ishaq up to the words “And to wear clothes with dye of waras or saffron on them”. They did not mention the words after them.<D>(Nay) it is sufficient to you, (but if you persevere) in war with your Prophet, (and keep from evil) and keep from contravening and disobeying Him, (and) the people of Mecca (attack you suddenly) from the direction of Mecca, (your Lord will help you) against your enemy (with five thousand angels sweeping on) 5,000 marked angels; it is also said this means: 5,000 angels wearing turbans of wool.<D>((Pharaoh) said unto those around him) of attendants: (Hear ye not) what Moses says?

(Lo! Allah will requite the charitable) in the life of this world and in the Hereafter.", "Generated_Answer": "The Hadith tradition regarding men wearing their garments (trousers, thobes, etc.) above the ankles is well-established and emphasizes humility and avoiding arrogance (*kibr*). The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) said: \"Whatever is below the ankles of the izar (garment) is in the Fire.\" (Bukhari). Another Hadith states: \"There are three whom Allah will not look at on the Day of Resurrection, nor will He purify them, and for them there will be a painful torment: the one who lets his garment hang down (below the ankles), the one who reminds others of his generosity, and the one who sells his goods by means of a false oath.\" (Muslim).\n\nThe core of the difference among the four Imams (Abu Hanifa, Malik, Shafi'i, and Ahmad ibn Hanbal) on this issue lies in whether the prohibition of letting the garment hang below the ankles (*izbal*) is absolute, or if it is conditional upon the intention of arrogance (*kibr*).\n\nHere's a breakdown of their general views:\n\n1.  **Imam Abu Hanifa (Hanafi School):**\n    *   **View:** Generally, letting the garment hang below the ankles is considered **Haram (forbidden)** if done out of arrogance (*kibr*).\n    *   **Without Arrogance:** Even if there is no intention of arrogance, it is considered **Makruh Tahrimi** (disliked to the point of being almost forbidden) or **Haram** by many later Hanafi scholars. The rationale is that such an act, even without direct intention, resembles the behaviour of the arrogant and is an act that can lead to arrogance, or at least is contrary to the Sunnah. Some early Hanafi scholars might have been slightly more lenient if there was absolutely no *kibr*, but the prevailing view is strict.\n\n2.  **Imam Malik (Maliki School):**\n    *   **View:** Similar to the Hanafi school, *izbal* is considered **Haram (forbidden)** if done out of arrogance.\n    *   **Without Arrogance:** Even without the intention of *kibr*, it is generally considered **Makruh Tahrimi** (severely disliked, close to forbidden) or **Haram** by many Maliki scholars. The act itself is seen as a violation of the Prophet's command and a means to display or fall into arrogance, even if not directly intended.\n\n3.  **Imam Ash-Shafi'i (Shafi'i School):**\n    *   **View:** The Shafi'i school often differentiates based on the intention.\n    *   **With Arrogance:** If done out of arrogance (*kibr*), it is **Haram (forbidden)** without any doubt.\n    *   **Without Arrogance:** If done *without* the intention of arrogance, it is considered **Makruh Tanzihi** (lightly disliked, but not forbidden). They cite the Hadith where Abu Bakr (RA) told the Prophet (PBUH) that his garment would occasionally slip down, and the Prophet responded, \"You are not one of those who do it out of pride.\" This Hadith is taken to mean that the primary prohibition is tied to arrogance. However, they still emphasize that it is better and more virtuous to keep the garment above the ankles to avoid resemblance to the arrogant and to ensure cleanliness.\n\n4.  **Imam Ahmad ibn Hanbal (Hanbali School):**\n    *   **View:** The Hanbali school is generally considered the strictest on this matter.\n    *   **With or Without Arrogance:** Most Hanbali scholars consider *izbal* to be **Haram (forbidden)** in all cases, regardless of whether the intention is arrogance or not. Their reasoning is that the Hadith mentions a general prohibition and severe warning without explicitly tying it to the intention of *kibr* for every individual. They argue that the act itself is a characteristic of the arrogant, and it is difficult for a person to genuinely claim they have no *kibr* when performing such an act, especially given the explicit warnings. They interpret the Hadith of Abu Bakr as a specific exception for him, not a general license.\n\n**Summary of Differences:**\n\nThe main difference revolves around the ruling when the act is *not* intended out of arrogance:\n\n*   **Hanafi and Maliki:** Generally lean towards *Makruh Tahrimi* or *Haram* even without explicit *kibr*, viewing the act itself as problematic and resembling arrogance.\n*   **Shafi'i:** Considers it *Makruh Tanzihi* (lightly disliked) if done without arrogance, emphasizing the intention as the primary factor for the *haram* ruling.\n*   **Hanbali:** Generally considers it *Haram* in all cases, regardless of claimed intention, due to the general prohibition and the nature of the act itself.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nDespite the nuances in their rulings regarding the *intention* of arrogance, all four schools agree that letting garments hang below the ankles *out of arrogance* is a major sin and strictly forbidden (*Haram*). Even for the schools that permit it without arrogance (Shafi'i, as *Makruh Tanzihi*), they still consider it better and more virtuous to adhere to the Sunnah of keeping garments above the ankles, as it reflects humility, cleanliness, and avoids any resemblance to the behaviour of the arrogant. Therefore, adhering to the Sunnah of wearing trousers above the ankles is the safest and most commendable approach according to all schools."}

So he said: Indeed, water does not become Junub.\"<D>Then Allah explained when this will take place, saying: (On the day when the earth and the hills rock) on the day when the earth and the mountains will quake, (and the hills become a heap of running sand.<D>(And the hills are set in motion) on the face of the earth (and become as a mirage. <D>(Lo! I have rewarded them this day) with Paradise (forasmuch as they were steadfast) in obeying me and withholding your harm; (and they verily are the triumphant) they have gained Paradise and become safe from hell. This verse was revealed about Abu Jahl and his host who mocked Salman [al-Farisi] and his fellow-believers", "Generated_Answer": "It's a common and understandable concern, but let's clarify the Islamic rulings regarding ritual purity (*taharah*) and impurity (*najasah*).\n\nThe most important distinction to understand is between:\n\n1.  **Hadath Akbar (Major Ritual Impurity):** This is a *state* of impurity that prevents you from performing certain acts of worship (like prayer, touching the Quran, circumambulating the Kaaba). Menstruation (*hayd*) puts a woman in this state. To remove this state, a full ritual bath (*ghusl*) is required *after* the period ends.\n2.  **Najasah Hissiyah (Physical Impurity):** This refers to actual, physically impure substances, such as blood (including menstrual blood), urine, feces, vomit, etc. If these substances touch something, that specific spot becomes physically impure and needs to be washed.\n\n**Here's how this applies to your situation:**\n\n*   **You are in a state of Hadath Akbar during your period.** This is true. You cannot pray, fast, or touch the Quran.\n*   **However, your body itself is NOT physically najis (impure) just because you are in this state.** This is a crucial point many people misunderstand. Your skin, hair, clothes, and breath are not inherently impure.\n\n**Therefore, to answer your specific questions:**\n\n1.  **\"Will everything I touch become napaak?\"**\n    **No, absolutely not.** Because your body is not physically impure, merely touching things (furniture, books, other people, walls, doors) will *not* transfer any \"impurity\" to them. Your presence, even while menstruating, does not make things impure.\n\n2.  **\"Since my hair will be wet after showering if any drops fall will they make things in the house napaak?\"**\n    **No.** The water drops from your hair are clean. Even though you are in a state of *hadath akbar*, the water that touches your body and then falls off is not considered najis. So, your floor, bed, or anything else will not become impure from wet hair drops.\n\n3.  **\"Since I have school and wear my coat and bag will they become napaak also?\"**\n    **No.** Your coat and bag will remain clean. Wearing clothes or carrying items while menstruating or needing a ghusl does not make those items impure.\n\n4.  **\"Since I cant wash that what should I do?\"**\n    There is nothing to wash, as nothing has become impure. You don't need to do anything with your clothes, bag, or household items.\n\n5.  **\"And has my bed and every other place before showering become napaak now?\"**\n    **No.** Your bed and every other place in your house remain clean. They were not impure before, and they did not become impure by you being there, sitting on them, or touching them.\n\n**In summary:**\n\n*   **You are in a state of major ritual impurity (*hadath akbar*) due to your period.** This means you cannot pray, fast, or touch the Quran until you perform *ghusl* after your period ends.\n*   **But your body is NOT physically impure (*najasah hissiya*).** This is vital.\n*   **Only if actual menstrual blood (a physically impure substance) gets on something does that specific spot become impure and need to be washed.** If there's no actual blood, there's no impurity to spread.\n\nIslam is a religion of ease. If being in a state of *hadath akbar* made everything a person touched impure, life would become extremely difficult, especially for women who experience menstruation regularly. This is not the teaching of Islam.\n\nPlease do not worry about things becoming impure by your touch during your period or when you need a ghusl. You are clean, and your surroundings remain clean."}

Later the Internet history revealed he was on those sights. Moulana please advise how do I deal with the situation without embarrassing my father or hurting my mother? I was in denial before and though he was only viewing pictures however I dont think that is the situation. Also my father is pious and I am so shocked. ? --T--", "Answer": "In a respectable way speak about the evils of illicit relationships, the consequences it could have, and how one can be deprived of barkat and blessings, mahabbat and understanding of deen. And Allah Taala ( ) knows best", "Document": "It was narrated from Sulaiman bin Buraidah from his father that the Prophet() said:\"Whoever plays backgammon, it is as if he dipped his hand in the flesh and blood of a pig.\"<D>It was narrated from Jafar bin Amr that his father said:\"I saw the Messenger of Allah wiping over his leather socks and turban.\"<D>It was narrated from Jafar bin Amr bin Umayyah Ad-Damri that his father saw the Messenger of Allah () performing Wudu and wiping over his Khuffs.<D>(Oh sister of Aaron!)

May Allah grant you strength and wisdom in this challenging time.\n\nLet's break down how to approach this, step by step, keeping Islamic principles and family well-being in mind.\n\n**Understanding the Gravity of the Situation:**\n\n1.  **Breach of Trust:** Your father has not only researched illicit activities but has also lied and actively deceived both you and your mother. This is a severe breach of trust within the family.\n2.  **Harm to Himself & Family:** Such actions, even if only \"researching\" initially, are a slippery slope towards sin (zina or its precursors). This is detrimental to his own soul, his relationship with Allah, and the sanctity of his marriage and family.\n3.  **Hypocrisy (Pious vs. Actions):** The shock of him being \"pious\" while engaging in this behavior highlights a deep internal struggle or hypocrisy. This needs to be addressed for his own spiritual well-being.\n4.  **Protecting Your Mother:** Your mother's peace of mind and rights within the marriage are paramount. While you want to protect her from pain, continued deception is also a form of harm.\n\n**Your Strategy: A Phased Approach**\n\nGiven your goals, a direct, private, and firm conversation with your father is the crucial first step. Telling your mother again immediately, without your father having a chance to address it, might indeed cause more immediate pain without a clear path forward.\n\n**Phase 1: The Private, Direct Confrontation with Your Father**\n\nThis conversation must be handled with utmost seriousness, sincerity, and firmness.\n\n1.  **Choose the Right Time and Place:** Find a moment when you can speak to him alone, without any interruptions, and when both of you are calm. Not when he's busy, tired, or just came home.\n2.  **Prepare What You Will Say:**\n    *   **Start with Love and Concern:** \"Baba, I need to talk to you about something very serious. I love you very much, and it's because I care about you and our family that I have to bring this up.\"\n    *   **State the Facts Clearly and Calmly (No Accusations, Just Facts):** \"Yesterday, when Mom and I returned, the door was locked. Later, I saw your internet history again, and it clearly showed you were on escort agency websites. This is the second time I've seen this.\"\n    *   **Express Your Feelings and the Impact:**\n        *   \"When I told Mama the first time, you denied it. And yesterday, you lied about sleeping. This breaks my trust in you. It hurts me deeply to see this, especially knowing how pious you are. It's shocking and confusing.\"\n        *   \"This behavior goes against everything you've taught us about Islam, about honesty, and about the sanctity of marriage. It worries me profoundly about your well-being, Mama's well-being, and the future of our family.\"\n    *   **Ask Open-Ended Questions (to understand, not to accuse):** \"Baba, what is going on? Is there something you're struggling with? Why are you doing this?\"\n    *   **Set Clear Boundaries and Expectations:**\n        *   \"I cannot ignore this. This is not just 'viewing pictures'; this is a dangerous path. It's a betrayal of Mama and a sin against Allah.\"\n        *   \"You need to understand the seriousness of this. If this continues, or if you do not address this truthfully and genuinely, I will have no choice but to tell Mama the full truth, because her well-being is at stake. I cannot allow her to live in deception.\" (This is the critical boundary. He needs to know the consequences of inaction/continued deception).\n        *   \"I want to help you, but you need to be honest with yourself and with us. You need to stop this immediately.\"\n    *   **Offer a Path to Redemption (if he shows remorse):** \"If you are genuinely struggling, please consider speaking to an Islamic scholar, a trusted Imam, or a professional counselor. This is a serious issue that needs to be dealt with, and Allah is Most Forgiving to those who truly repent and seek change.\"\n3.  **Listen to His Response:** He might deny, get angry, cry, or offer excuses. Listen calmly. Don't get drawn into an argument. Reiterate your points: \"Baba, I saw the history. The lying is what concerns me most.\"\n4.  **Observe His Reaction and Commitment:** Does he show remorse? Does he promise to stop? Does he acknowledge the deception? Does he agree to seek help?\n\n**Phase 2: After the Confrontation – What Next?**\n\nThis is where your father's response will determine the next steps.\n\n*   **Scenario A: He shows genuine remorse, acknowledges the issue, and commits to change.**\n    *   **Your Role:** Hold him accountable. Suggest he talks to an Islamic scholar or counselor immediately. Encourage him to confess to your mother (with you present for support, if he wishes) and seek her forgiveness. This preserves his dignity slightly, as he is taking responsibility. You could say, \"Baba, for true peace and healing, you need to confess to Mama and ask for her forgiveness. I will be there to support both of you.\"\n    *   **Monitoring:** Keep an eye on his behavior (respecting his privacy as much as possible, but being vigilant about red flags).\n*   **Scenario B: He denies, gets defensive, gets angry, or makes hollow promises without a commitment to real change.**\n    *   **Your Role:** In this case, you **must** tell your mother. Your father has forfeited his right to secrecy by continuing the deception and refusing to take responsibility. Protecting your mother from continued lies and potential deeper harm becomes your priority.\n    *   **How to tell your mother:**\n        *   Choose a private, calm moment.\n        *   Approach her with immense love and concern, not anger towards your father.\n        *   \"Mama, I have something very difficult to tell you. It deeply pains me, and I've tried to handle it privately, but I feel you deserve to know the truth for your own well-being.\"\n        *   State the facts clearly, as you did to your father, but with empathy for your mother's inevitable pain.\n        *   Emphasize that you are telling her out of love and concern for her, and because you cannot bear to see her deceived.\n        *   Be prepared for her shock, anger, sadness, and confusion. Offer her your unwavering support. She may need time, space, or even professional counseling.\n\n**Islamic Perspective and Guidance:**\n\n*   **Sitra (Covering Faults):** Islam encourages covering the faults of others (sitra), especially if the sin is private and does not harm others. However, when a sin involves deception, repeated behavior, and directly harms another person (your mother, in this case, through breach of trust and potential infidelity), then sitra does not apply to the same extent. You have an obligation to protect the one being harmed. You already attempted sitra by speaking to your father privately the first time. His continued deception nullifies that.\n*   **Naseeha (Sincere Advice):** Your confrontation with your father is a form of naseeha – sincere advice for the sake of Allah and for his own good.\n*   **Trust in Marriage:** Trust is fundamental to an Islamic marriage. His actions are eroding this foundation.\n*   **Seeking Help:** Encourage your father to seek help from a trusted Islamic scholar, an Imam, or a Muslim counselor. There might be underlying issues (stress, mid-life crisis, spiritual emptiness) that need to be addressed.\n*   **Dua:** Make abundant dua (supplication) to Allah for guidance, for your parents' well-being, for strength for yourself, and for your father's repentance and rectification.\n\nThis is a heavy burden for you, but remember that you are doing this out of love and a desire for what is right. May Allah ease your difficulties and guide your family to peace and truth."}

{"Question": "Q: I have come into contact with a guy at work, who had already researched a lot about Islam via the internet.

There is no point in talking about secondary issues when he has not accepted the fundamental issues. Dont waste your time with such people. And Allah Taala ( ) knows best", "Document": "Narrated Aisha:(the wife of the Prophet) \"Whenever Allahs Apostle intended to go on a journey, he would draw lots amongst his wives and would take with him the one upon whom the lot fell. During a Ghazwa of his, he drew lots amongst us and the lot fell upon me, and I proceeded with him after Allah had decreed the use of the veil by women. I was carried in a Howdah (on the camel) and dismounted while still in it. When Allahs Apostle was through with his Ghazwa and returned home, and we approached the city of Medina, Allahs Apostle ordered us to proceed at night. When the order of setting off was given, I walked till I was past the army to answer the call of nature. After finishing I returned (to the camp) to depart (with the others) and suddenly realized that my necklace over my chest was missing. So, I returned to look for it and was delayed because of that. The people who used to carry me on the camel, came to my Howdah and put it on the back of the camel, thinking that I was in it, as, at that time, women were light in weight, and thin and lean, and did not use to eat much. So, those people did not feel the difference in the heaviness of the Howdah while lifting it, and they put it over the camel. At that time I was a young lady. They set the camel moving and proceeded on. I found my necklace after the army had gone, and came to their camp to find nobody. So, I went to the place where I used to stay, thinking that they would discover my absence and come back in my search. While in that state, I felt sleepy and slept. Safwan bin Muattal As-Sulami Adh-Dhakwani was behind the army and reached my abode in the morning. When he saw a sleeping person, he came to me, and he used to see me before veiling. So, I got up when I heard him saying, \"Inna lil-lah-wa inn a ilaihi rajiun (We are for Allah, and we will return to Him).\" He made his camel knell down. He got down from his camel, and put his leg on the front legs of the camel and then I rode and sat over it. Safwan set out walking, leading the camel by the rope till we reached the army who had halted to take rest at midday. Then whoever was meant for destruction, fell into destruction, (some people accused me falsely) and the leader of the false accusers was `Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul. After that we returned to Medina, and I became ill for one month while the people were spreading the forged statements of the false accusers. I was feeling during my ailment as if I were not receiving the usual kindness from the Prophet which I used to receive from him when I got sick. But he would come, greet and say, How is that (girl)? I did not know anything of what was going on till I recovered from my ailment and went out with Um Mistah to the Manasi where we used to answer the call of nature, and we used not to go to answer the call of nature except from night to night and that was before we had lavatories near to our houses. And this habit of ours was similar to the habit of the old Arabs in the open country (or away from houses). So. I and Um Mistah bint Ruhm went out walking. Um Mistah stumbled because of her long dress and on that she said, Let Mistah be ruined. I said, You are saying a bad word. Why are you abusing a man who took part in (the battle of) Badr? She said, O Hanata (you there) didnt you hear what they said? Then she told me the rumors of the false accusers. My sickness was aggravated, and when I returned home, Allahs Apostle came to me, and after greeting he said, How is that (girl)? I requested him to allow me to go to my parents. I wanted then to be sure of the news through them I Allahs Apostle allowed me, and I went to my parents and asked my mother, What are the people talking about? She said, O my daughter! Dont worry much about this matter. By Allah, never is there a charming woman loved by her husband who has other wives, but the women would forge false news about her. I said, Glorified be Allah! Are the people really taking of this matter? That night I kept on weeping and could not sleep till morning. In the morning Allahs Apostle called `Ali bin Abu Talib and Usama bin Zaid when he saw the Divine Inspiration delayed, to consul them about divorcing his wife (i.e. `Aisha). Usama bin Zaid said what he knew of the good reputation of his wives and added, O Allahs Apostle! Keep you wife, for, by Allah, we know nothing about her but good. `Ali bin Abu Talib said, O Allahs Apostle! Allah has no imposed restrictions on you, and there are many women other than she, yet you may ask the woman-servant who will tell you the truth. On that Allahs Apostle called Buraira and said, O Burair. Did you ever see anything which roused your suspicions about her? Buraira said, No, by Allah Who has sent you with the Truth, I have never seen in her anything faulty except that she is a girl of immature age, who sometimes sleeps and leaves the dough for the goats to eat. On that day Allahs Apostle ascended the pulpit and requested that somebody support him in punishing `Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul. Allahs Apostle said, Who will support me to punish that person (`Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul) who has hurt me by slandering the reputation of my family? By Allah, I know nothing about my family but good, and they have accused a person about whom I know nothing except good, and he never entered my house except in my company. Sa`d bin Mu`adh got up and said, O Allahs Apostle! by Allah, I will relieve you from him. If that man is from the tribe of the Aus, then we will chop his head off, and if he is from our brothers, the Khazraj, then order us, and we will fulfill your order. On that Sa`d bin Ubada, the chief of the Khazraj and before this incident, he had been a pious man, got up, motivated by his zeal for his tribe and said, By Allah, you have told a lie; you cannot kill him, and you will never be able to kill him. On that Usaid bin Al-Hadir got up and said (to Sa`d bin Ubada), By Allah! you are a liar. By Allah, we will kill him; and you are a hypocrite, defending the hypocrites. On this the two tribes of Aus and Khazraj got excited and were about to fight each other, while Allahs Apostle was standing on the pulpit. He got down and quieted them till they became silent and he kept quiet. On that day I kept on weeping so much so that neither did my tears stop, nor could I sleep. In the morning my parents were with me and I had wept for two nights and a day, till I thought my liver would burst from weeping. While they were sitting with me and I was weeping, an Ansari woman asked my permission to enter, and I allowed her to come in. She sat down and started weeping with me. While we were in this state, Allahs Apostle came and sat down and he had never sat with me since the day they forged the accusation. No revelation regarding my case came to him for a month. He recited Tashah-hud (i.e. None has the right to be worshipped but Allah and Muhammad is His Apostle) and then said, O `Aisha! I have been informed such-and-such about you; if you are innocent, then Allah will soon reveal your innocence, and if you have committed a sin, then repent to Allah and ask Him to forgive you, for when a person confesses his sin and asks Allah for forgiveness, Allah accepts his repentance. When Allahs Apostle finished his speech my tears ceased completely and there remained not even a single drop of it. I requested my father to reply to Allahs Apostle on my behalf. My father said, By Allah, I do not know what to say to Allahs Apostle. I said to my mother, Talk to Allahs Apostle on my behalf. She said, By Allah, I do not know what to say to Allahs Apostle. I was a young girl and did not have much knowledge of the Quran. I said. I know, by Allah, that you have listened to what people are saying and that has been planted in your minds and you have taken it as a truth. Now, if I told you that I am innocent and Allah knows that I am innocent, you would not believe me and if I confessed to you falsely that I am guilty, and Allah knows that I am innocent you would believe me. By Allah, I dont compare my situation with you except to the situation of Josephs father (i.e. Jacob) who said, So (for me) patience is most fitting against that which you assert and it is Allah (Alone) whose help can be sought. Then I turned to the other side of my bed hoping that Allah would prove my innocence. By Allah I never thought that Allah would reveal Divine Inspiration in my case, as I considered myself too inferior to be talked of in the Holy Quran. I had hoped that Allahs Apostle might have a dream in which Allah would prove my innocence. By Allah, Allahs Apostle had not got up and nobody had left the house before the Divine Inspiration came to Allahs Apostle. So, there overtook him the same state which used to overtake him, (when he used to have, on being inspired divinely). He was sweating so much so that the drops of the sweat were dropping like pearls though it was a (cold) wintry day. When that state of Allahs Apostle was over, he was smiling and the first word he said, `Aisha! Thank Allah, for Allah has declared your innocence. My mother told me to go to Allahs Apostle . I replied, By Allah I will not go to him and will not thank but Allah. So Allah revealed: \"Verily! They who spread the slander are a gang among you . . .\" (24.11) When Allah gave the declaration of my Innocence, Abu Bakr, who used to provide for Mistah bin Uthatha for he was his relative, said, By Allah, I will never provide Mistah with anything because of what he said about Aisha. But Allah later revealed: -- \"And let not those who are good and wealthy among you swear not to help their kinsmen, those in need and those who left their homes in Allahs Cause. Let them forgive and overlook. Do you not wish that Allah should forgive you? Verily! Allah is Oft-forgiving, Most Merciful.\" (24.22) After that Abu Bakr said, Yes ! By Allah! I like that Allah should forgive me, and resumed helping Mistah whom he used to help before. Allahs Apostle also asked Zainab bint Jahsh (i.e. the Prophets wife about me saying, What do you know and what did you see? She replied, O Allahs Apostle! I refrain to claim hearing or seeing what I have not heard or seen. By Allah, I know nothing except goodness about Aisha.\" Aisha further added \"Zainab was competing with me (in her beauty and the Prophets love), yet Allah protected her (from being malicious), for she had piety.\"<D>Narrated Qatadah bin An-Numan:\"There was a household among us called Banu Ubairiq, among whom was a Bishr, a Bushair, and a Mubashshir. Bushair was a hypocrite who would recite poetry reviling the Companions of the Prophet () then he would attribute it to some of the Arabs. Then he would say: So-and-so said this and that [So-and-so said this and that]. So when the Companions of the Prophet () would hear that poetry, they would say: By Allah! No one but this filthy person said this poetry - or as the man said - and they would say: Ibn Al-Ubairiq said it.\" He said: \"They were a poor and needy household during Jahiliyyah and Islam. The only food the people of Al-Madinah had was dates and barely. When a man was able to, he would import flour from Ash-Sham which he bought and kept for himself. As for his dependants, their only food was dates and barely. So an import arrived from Ash-Sham, and my uncle Rifaah bin Zaid bought a load of it, which he put in a storage area he had, where he kept his weapons - his shield and his sword. But it was taken from him from under the house. The storage was broken into and and the food and weapons were taken. In the morning, my uncle Rifaah came to me and said: O my nephew! We were robbed during the night, our storage was broken into, and our food and weapons are gone.\" He said: \"They overheard us in the house, and questioned us, and someone said to us, We saw Banu Ubairiq cooking during the night, and it looked like they had some of your food.\" He said: \"Banu Ubairiq were saying - while we were questioning them amidst their dwellings - By Allah! We do not think the one you are looking for is other than Labid bin Sahl, a man among us who is righteous and accepted Islam. When Labid heard that, he brandished his sword and said: I stole? By Allah! You either prove this theft, or I take to you with this sword. They said: Leave us O man! You are not the one who has it. So we continued questioning in the dwellings until we had no doubt that they had taken it. So my uncle said to me: O my nephew! You should go to the Messenger of Allah () and tell him about that.\" Qatadah said: \"So I went to the Messenger of Allah () and said: A family among us are ill-mannered, and they conspired against my uncle Rifaah bin aid. They broken into his storage and took his weapons and his food. We want them to return our weapons, but we have no need for the food. So the Prophet () said: I will decide about that. So when Banu Ubairiq heard about that, they brought a man from among them named Usair bin Urwah to talk to him about that, and some people form their houses gathered and said: O Messenger of Allah! Qatadah bin An-Numan and his uncle came came to a family among us who are a people of Islam and righteousness, accusing them of stealing without proof or confirmation.\" Qatadah said: \"I went to the Messenger of Allah () and spoke to him, and he said: You went to a family among them known for their Islam and righteousness, and accused them of stealing without confirmation or proof.\" He said: \"So I returned wishing that I had lost some of my wealth, and that the Messenger of Allah () had not been spoke to about that. My uncle Rifaah came to me and said: O my nephew! What did you do? So I told him what the Messenger of Allah () said to me, so he said: It is from Allah, Whom we seek help. It was not long before the Quran was revealed: Surely, We have sent down to you the Book in truth, that you might judge between men by that which Allah has shown you, so be not a pelader for the treacherous. That is Banu Ubairiq. And seek forgiveness from Allah. [That is] from what you said to Qatadah. Certainly Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful. And argue not on behalf of those who deceive themselves. Verily, Allah does not like anyone who is a betrayer, sinner. They may hide from men, but they cannot hide from Allah for He is with them up to His saying: Most Merciful. That is: If you seek Allahs forgiveness then He will forgive you. And whoever earns sin, he earns it only against himself... up to His saying: A manifest sin. Their saying about Labid; Had it not been for the grace of Allah and His Mercy upon you... up to His saying: We shall give him a great reward. (4:105-115)\" So when the Quran was revealed, the Messenger of Allah () brought the weapon and returned it to Rifaah. Qatadah said: \"When the weapon was brought to my uncle - and he was an elderly man with bad sight\" or \"an elderly weak man\" - Abu Eisa was in doubt - \"in Jahiliyyah, and I thought that he merely had entered into Islam (without real sincerity) but when I brought it to him, he said: O my nephew! It is for Allahs cause. So I knew that his Islam was genuine. When the Quran was revealed, Bushair went with the idolaters, staying with Sulafah bint Sad bin Sumayyah. So Allah, Most High, revealed: Whoever contradicts and opposes the Messenger after the right path has been shown clearly to him, and follows other than the believers way, We shall keep him in the path he has chosen, and burn him in Hell - what an evil destination. Verily Allah forgives not associating others with Him, but He forgives what is less than that for whomever He wills. And whoever associates others with Allah, then he has indeed strayed away (4:115-116). \"When he went to stay with Sulafah, Hassan bin Thabit lampooned her with verses of poetry. So she took his saddle, put it on her head, then she left with it to cast into the valley. Then she said: You gave me the poetry of Hassan - you did not bring me any good.\"<D>Narrated Ibn `Abbas:When Abu Dhar received the news of the Advent of the Prophet he said to his brother, \"Ride to this valley (of Mecca) and try to find out the truth of the person who claims to be a prophet who is informed of the news of Heaven. Listen to what he says and come back to me.\" So his brother set out and came to the Prophet and listened to some of his talks, and returned to Abu Dhar and said to him. \"I have seen him enjoining virtuous behavior and saying something that is not poetry.\" Abu Dhar said, \"You have not satisfied me as to what I wanted.\" He then took his journey-food and carried a waterskin of his, containing some water till be reached Mecca. He went to the Mosque and searched for the Prophet and though he did not know him, he hated to ask anybody about him. When a part of the night had passed away, `Ali saw him and knew that he was a stranger. So when Abu Dhar saw `Ali, he followed him, and none of them asked his companion about anything, and when it was dawn, Abu Dhar took his journey food and his water-skin to the Mosque and stayed there all the day long without being perceived by the Prophet, and when it was evening, he came back to his retiring place. `Ali passed by him and said, \"Has the man not known his dwelling place yet?\" So `Ali awakened him and took him with him and none of them spoke to the other about anything. When it was the third day. `Ali did the same and Abu Dhar stayed with him. Then `Ali said \"Will you tell me what has brought you here?\" Abu Dhar said, \"If you give me a firm promise that you will guide me, then I will tell you.\" `Ali promised him, and he informed `Ali about the matter. `Ali said, \"It is true, and he is the Apostle of Allah. Next morning when you get up, accompany me, and if I see any danger for you, I will stop as if to pass water, but if I go on, follow me and enter the place which I will enter.\" Abu Dhar did so, and followed `Ali till he entered the place of the Prophet, and Abu Dhar went in with him, Abu Dhar listened to some of the Prophets talks and embraced Islam on the spot. The Prophet said to him, \"Go back to your people and inform them (about it) till you receive my order.\" Abu Dhar said, \"By Him in Whose Hand my life is, I will proclaim my conversion loudly amongst them (i.e. the pagans).\" So he went out, and when he reached the Mosque, he said as loudly as possible, \"I bear witness that None has the right to be worshipped except Allah, and Muhammad is the Apostle of Allah.\" The People got up and beat him painfully. Then Al-Abbas came and knelt over him ((to protect him) and said (to the people), \"Woe to you! Dont you know that this man belongs to the tribe of Ghifar and your trade to Sham is through their way?\" So he rescued him from them. Abu Dhar again did the same the next day. They beat him and took vengeance on him and again Al-Abbas knelt over him (to protect him).<D>Allah then mentions the dispute of the Jews and Christians and the question which they put to the Prophet (pbuh) regarding who really follows the religion of Abraham. When the Prophet (pbuh) told them that they were both far from the Religion of Abraham, they said that they did not accept this judgement. Hence, Allah said: (Seek they) with you (other than the religion of Allah) Islam (complete surrender to Allah), (when unto Him submiteth) acknowledges Islam and Allahs divine Oneness (whosoever is in the heavens) of angels(and the earth) of believers, (willingly) the dwellers of the heavens willingly, (or unwillingly) the dwellers ofthe earth unwillingly. It is also said that this means: the sincere among the believers acknowledge this willingly while the hypocrites do so unwillingly; it is also said this means: those who are born Muslim acknowledge this willingly while those who were made to embrace Islam do so unwillingly, (and unto Him they will be returned) after death.<D>(Wait they) i.e. the people of Mecca, (indeed, for nothing less than that the angels should come unto them) to take their souls away at the moment of death, (or thy Lord should come) on the Day of Judgement, and His coming is without modality, (or there should come one of the portents from thy Lord) i.e. the rising of the sun from the West? (In the day when one of the portents from they Lord cometh) before the rising of the sun from the West, (its belief availeth naught a soul which theretofore) before the rising of the sun from the West (believed not, nor in its belief earned good) nor was it sincere in its belief, nor doing any good works before the rising of the sun from the West. This is because no faith, works or repentance areaccepted from an unbeliever who embraces Islam upon seeing the sun rise from the West, unless thatperson is young at that time or is born after. In such a case, if he leaves Islam after the sun rises from the West and then returns to Islam, his repentance is accepted. Likewise, the repentance of a sinning believer who repents of his sins after the sun rises from the West is accepted. (Say) O Muhammad to the people of Mecca: (Wait you) the Day of Judgement! (Lo! We (too) are waiting) for your punishment on the Day of Judgement or before the Day of Judgement; it is also said that this means: Say, O Muhammad, wait for my destruction, I am also waiting for yours.<D>(And a generation hath succeeded them) a generation of people succeeded the righteous ones, but their successors, among the Jews, were evil (who inherited the Scriptures) they took the Scripture and concealed the traits and description of Muhammad (pbuh) that is in it. (They grasp the goods of this low life (as the price of evil doing)) they take bribes and other unlawful stuff of this world in exchange for concealing the traits and description of Muhammad (pbuh) (and say: It will be forgiven us) the sins we commit at night shall be forgiven during the day, and the sins we commit in the day shall be forgiven at night. (And if there came to them (again)) today (the offer of the like) similar to the unlawful that had come to them before, (they would accept it) and declaring to be lawful. (Hath not the covenant of the Scripture been taken on their behalf that they should not speak aught concerning Allah save the Truth? And they have studied that which is therein) of the traits and attributes of Muhammad (pbuh); it is also said that this means: they studied what is in it of the lawful and the unlawful but did not act upon it. (And the abode of the Hereafter) i.e. Paradise (is better, for those who ward off (evil)) ward off disbelief, idolatry, indecencies, bribery and changing the traits and description of the Prophet (pbuh) in the Torah. Warding off these is better than the abode of the life of this world. (Have ye then no sense?) do you not realise that the life of this world is vanishing and the Hereafter is everlasting?", "Generated_Answer": "Your dedication to explaining Islam to your colleague is commendable, and it's excellent that he's engaging with fundamental concepts like Tawhid and Risalat. These are crucial starting points.\n\nLet's address your answer and provide a more comprehensive explanation for his question.\n\n---\n\n### What was wrong with your answer?\n\nYour answer, \"it was eventually forbidden, and it was over a period of time, so that the people will willingly accept and obey,\" is **partially correct regarding the *gradual nature of change*, but incorrect regarding the *outcome* for slavery.**\n\n1.  **Regarding Alcohol:** You are absolutely correct that its prohibition was gradual and phased, allowing people to adjust and willingly accept it. This is a brilliant example of divine wisdom in legislation.\n2.  **Regarding Slavery:** This is where the correction is needed. Islam **did not \"eventually forbid\" slavery as an institution in the same explicit, unconditional way it forbade alcohol.** Instead, Islam took revolutionary steps to severely restrict, regulate, and actively encourage the *abolition* and *extinction* of slavery, making its acquisition extremely difficult and its manumission highly virtuous. The ultimate goal was its demise, but not through an immediate, outright prohibition that would have caused societal collapse at the time.\n\n---\n\n### A Comprehensive Answer to \"Why Alcohol was Forbidden Unconditionally, but Slavery only Regulated?\"\n\nThis is an excellent and insightful question that demonstrates a desire for deeper understanding. Here’s how you can explain it:\n\n**1. The Wisdom of Gradual Legislation (Applies to Both):**\n\nYou were correct to highlight the gradual nature of change in Islam. This is a key principle of Islamic legislation. Allah, in His infinite wisdom, understands human nature and the challenges of societal transformation.\n\n*   **Alcohol:** Before Islam, alcohol was deeply ingrained in Arabian society. It was forbidden in stages:\n    1.  Initially, a verse indicated that its harm outweighed its benefits (Qur'an 2:219).\n    2.  Then, Muslims were told not to pray while intoxicated (Qur'an 4:43), ensuring sobriety during worship.\n    3.  Finally, it was unequivocally forbidden (Qur'an 5:90-91), with strong warnings against it.\n    This gradual approach allowed society to adapt, making the ultimate, unconditional prohibition more readily accepted. The reason for its *total* prohibition is its inherent harm to the individual's mind, health, family, and society, preventing remembrance of Allah and leading to other sins.\n\n**2. Islam's Revolutionary Approach to Slavery (The Core Difference):**\n\nThe difference lies in the *nature* of the issue and its integration into the existing global socio-economic fabric.\n\n*   **Slavery Pre-Islam:** Slavery was a universal institution across the world (Roman Empire, Persian Empire, Africa, Asia, etc.). It was an integral part of the economic, social, and political structure. People were enslaved for various reasons: war captives, debt, kidnapping, crime, or being born to enslaved parents. Islam did not *introduce* slavery; it encountered it as a deeply entrenched global reality.\n\n*   **Islam's Strategy: Regulation, Restriction, and Eradication, Not Immediate Abolition:**\n    Instead of an immediate, outright ban (which would have caused widespread economic and social collapse, leading to greater chaos and suffering), Islam implemented a revolutionary, multi-faceted approach aimed at the *eventual abolition* of slavery by:\n\n    *   **A. Severely Restricting Sources of Enslavement:**\n        *   Islam **closed almost all existing avenues** of slavery. It strictly forbade enslavement due to debt, kidnapping, selling free people, or arbitrary capture.\n        *   The *only* remaining permissible source was **captives of a just war**, and even then, their status was conditional. Prisoners of war could be freed for ransom, exchanged, or simply released, with enslavement being one of several options, often as a last resort in a world where no Geneva Conventions existed for POWs.\n\n    *   **B. Encouraging Manumission (Freeing Slaves) as a High Virtue:**\n        *   **Huge Spiritual Reward:** Freeing a slave was declared one of the most meritorious acts in Islam, earning immense reward from Allah. It was seen as freeing a soul and bringing immense blessings.\n        *   **Expiation for Sins:** Manumission was made a prescribed atonement for various sins and errors, such as:\n            *   Breaking an oath (Qur'an 5:89).\n            *   Accidental killing (Qur'an 4:92).\n            *   Breaking certain vows (e.g., Zihar, a form of divorce in pre-Islamic Arabia - Qur'an 58:3).\n            *   Breaking fasts.\n        *   **Zakat Funds:** A portion of the obligatory charity (Zakat) was specifically allocated to freeing slaves (Qur'an 9:60).\n        *   **Self-Purchase (Mukataba):** A slave could make a contract with their master to buy their freedom over time, and the master was encouraged to agree and assist them (Qur'an 24:33).\n        *   **Children of Slave Women:** If a master had a child with his slave woman, that child was born free, and the mother could not be sold and became free upon the master's death.\n\n    *   **C. Establishing Rights and Humane Treatment for Slaves:**\n        *   Islam mandated that slaves be treated with kindness, respect, and dignity. They were to be fed, clothed, and housed adequately.\n        *   Abuse was strictly forbidden. The Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) said, \"Your slaves are your brothers; Allah has put them under your control. So, whoever has his brother under his control, should feed him with the like of what he eats and clothe him with the like of what he wears. Do not burden them with what they cannot bear, and if you do so, then help them.\" (Bukhari & Muslim)\n        *   Slaves had a right to justice and could complain against their masters for ill-treatment.\n        *   Masters were encouraged to marry their slaves and treat them with respect.\n\n**3. Why the Difference in Approach? (The Crux):**\n\nThe core reason for the different approaches is the **nature of the harm and the immediate societal impact of an outright ban:**\n\n*   **Alcohol:** Its harm is inherent, direct, and universally detrimental to the individual's consciousness, health, family, and public order. Its immediate ban, while requiring adjustment, did not dismantle the fundamental structure of society. It was a clear, unmitigated evil.\n\n*   **Slavery:** While morally repugnant, slavery was a deeply interwoven part of the global economic and social fabric. An immediate, unconditional ban on slavery at that time would have:\n    *   **Caused Economic Collapse:** Slave labor was essential to agriculture, trade, and household economy. Freeing everyone overnight without alternative economic structures would have led to widespread poverty, famine, and chaos.\n    *   **Created Social Anarchy:** Millions of people would suddenly be without a defined social role or means of support, potentially leading to crime, unrest, and instability.\n    *   **Been Impractical Globally:** Islam was emerging in a world where slavery was the norm. An immediate ban within Islamic lands might have been seen as economically crippling and put Muslims at a severe disadvantage.\n\n**Therefore, Islam adopted a pragmatic, yet profoundly moral, long-term strategy:**\nIt *choked off* the sources of new slavery, *incentivized* and *facilitated* the freeing of existing slaves, and *humanized* their treatment, aiming for the institution to gradually wither away as the moral conscience of society evolved and alternative economic structures developed. This was a process of revolutionary reform from within, rather than an immediate, destructive overthrow of a deeply entrenched global system.\n\n---\n\n### Conclusion for your Colleague:\n\nYou can explain to him that Islam's approach to both alcohol and slavery demonstrates its **divine wisdom and practical realism**.\n\n*   For **alcohol**, the harm was so direct and pervasive that a gradual but ultimate prohibition was the best path for individual and societal well-being.\n*   For **slavery**, while its moral wrongness was clear, its deeply entrenched nature in the world required a nuanced, phased approach to dismantle it from within, preventing greater harm and chaos, while simultaneously setting the ultimate goal of its eradication.\n\nThis shows that Islam is not just an idealist religion, but one that provides practical solutions for real-world problems, always prioritizing the overall welfare of humanity. Encourage him to keep asking such questions, as they lead to a deeper appreciation of Islam's profound wisdom."}

Deodorants:**\n*   **Permissible and Highly Recommended:** Using deodorants is highly encouraged. Islam places great emphasis on cleanliness (*taharah*) and purity. Preventing body odor is a sign of good hygiene and consideration for others, especially in a communal setting like the Masjid. It ensures that your presence does not cause discomfort or distraction to fellow worshippers.\n\n**2. Perfumes (Itr/Attar):**\n\n*   **For Men:**\n    *   **Highly Recommended (Sunnah):** For men, using perfume (especially *itr* or attar, which are alcohol-free traditional oils) is a highly recommended Sunnah, particularly for Jumu'ah (Friday prayer) and Eid prayers. The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) loved good scents and encouraged men to wear them.\n    *   **Reason:** It is considered an adornment for prayer, showing respect for Allah, the Masjid, and the congregation. It creates a pleasant atmosphere for worship.\n\n*   **For Women:**\n    *   **General Principle of Modesty:** Islam encourages women to be modest and avoid attracting undue attention from non-mahram men when outside their homes. This principle extends to the use of perfume.\n    *   **Strong/Alluring Perfumes (Discouraged/Prohibited):** It is generally *not permissible* for women to wear strong, outwardly alluring perfumes that are clearly detectable by others outside their immediate vicinity, especially when going to the Masjid or any public place where non-mahram men are present.\n    *   **Hadith:** The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) said: \"Any woman who wears perfume and passes by a gathering so that they can smell her, she is such and such (meaning a fornicator).\" (Sunan Abi Dawud, Tirmidhi). This hadith emphasizes that a woman should not wear perfume that is intended to attract attention or arouse desire.\n    *   **Subtle/Light Scents (Permissible):** If a woman uses a very light, subtle perfume or deodorant that is only for her personal freshness and not detectable by others from a distance (i.e., it doesn't leave a trail and is not designed to be outwardly alluring), then this would generally be permissible, as it aligns with personal hygiene and does not violate the principle of modesty. The intention should be for cleanliness and freshness, not for adornment for non-mahrams.\n\n**General Considerations for Both Men and Women:**\n\n1.  **Moderation:** Even when permissible, avoid excessive use that might be overwhelming or cause discomfort to others who may have allergies or sensitivities.\n2.  **Halal Ingredients:** Ensure that the deodorant or perfume does not contain any impure (najis) or prohibited ingredients (e.g., alcohol derived from grapes or dates, though most modern synthetic alcohol in perfumes is considered permissible by many scholars).\n3.  **Intention:** The intention should be to be clean, presentable, and respectful in the presence of Allah and the congregation, not to show off or attract attention.\n\n**In summary:**\n\n*   **Deodorants:** Highly recommended for everyone.\n*   **Perfumes for Men:** Highly recommended and Sunnah.\n*   **Perfumes for Women:** Only light, subtle scents for personal freshness are permissible. Strong, alluring, or outwardly noticeable perfumes are not permissible when going to the Masjid or public places."}

The latter is called a Bahirah. The latters milk and benefits were for men only, to the exclusion of women, and when she died both men and women could share her meat. As for the Saibah, people used to give whatever they were willing to give of cattle and hand it over to the custodians of idols. The latter would offer it to travellers who passed by, the men not the women. The animals offered were also male and never female. When thesedied both men and women shared its meat. As for the Wasilah, when a sheep had delivered seven times, they used to check the seventh birth. If it were male, they used to immolate it and its meat was shared by men and women. If it were female, women would not be allowed to benefit from it until the animal died. When the animal died, both men and women shared its meat. If it were a twin delivery, male and female, both were spared for the benefit of men only, until their death. When the animal died, both men and women shared their meat. As for the Ham, it is the male camel whose offspring has produced its own offspring, it is said that such an animal has protected its back. This animal is left alone: it is not used forriding or transporting things. It cannot be stopped from drinking of any water or grazing in any pasture, norcan it be stopped from copulating with any she-camel that comes its way. When this animal gets too old or dies, its meat is shared by men and women. Allah says that He did not prescribe any of these practices described above; (but those who disbelieve) i.e. Amr ibn Luhayy and his followers (invent a lie against Allah) by declaring the above unlawful [for some]. (Most of them) all of them (have no sense) in relation to Allahs command, that which He has made lawful and that which He has made unlawful.", "Generated_Answer": "This is a common question, and there's a difference of opinion among Islamic scholars regarding the permissibility of alcohol-based hand sanitizers, primarily stemming from two main points:\n\n1.  **Is the alcohol in these products considered \"khamr\" (intoxicant) and thus ritually impure (najis)?**\n2.  **Even if it's not for consumption, can it be used externally if derived from something considered impure?**\n\nLet's break down the different scholarly views:\n\n---\n\n### **View 1: Generally Impermissible for Prayer Purity (More Conservative View)**\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\n*   **Alcohol as Najis:** Many classical scholars (from the Hanafi, Shafi'i, and Hanbali schools) consider *khamr* (alcohol from grapes, dates, etc., that intoxicates) to be ritually impure (*najis*), similar to urine or faeces.\n*   **Application to Sanitizers:** They argue that if something is *najis*, then touching it or having it on your body or clothes means you are not in a state of ritual purity (*tahara*) required for prayer. Even if the alcohol evaporates, the initial contact with the impure substance occurred.\n*   **Avoidance:** For this view, one should avoid alcohol-based sanitizers, especially if preparing for prayer.\n\n**Implication for You:** If you follow this view, then after using the sanitizer, your hands (and anything it touched) would be considered impure. You would need to wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water before performing wudu (ablution) or prayer.\n\n---\n\n### **View 2: Permissible for External Use (More Lenient/Contemporary View)**\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\n*   **Distinction between Consumption and External Use:** This view emphasizes that the prohibition of alcohol in the Quran and Sunnah primarily pertains to *consumption* (drinking) due to its intoxicating effect. External use for disinfection or as a solvent does not lead to intoxication.\n*   **Alcohol Type/Source:** Some scholars distinguish between alcohol produced naturally (like wine) and synthetic or industrial alcohol (ethanol) used in products, arguing that not all types fall under the *khamr* prohibition.\n*   **Necessity (Dharurah/Hajah):** Especially in modern times and during health crises (like pandemics), the use of hand sanitizers is often a necessity for hygiene and preventing disease, particularly when soap and water are not readily available. Many contemporary scholars issued fatwas (religious edicts) permitting their use on this basis.\n*   **Not Najis by Nature:** Some scholars (including some Maliki scholars and a number of contemporary jurists) argue that while *khamr* is forbidden to consume, its *essence* is not ritually impure (*najis*) in the same way as other impurities. They argue that the impurity is related to its effect (intoxication) and not its substance.\n\n**Implication for You:** If you follow this view, using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer is permissible and does not render your hands impure for prayer. You would not need to specifically wash your hands *because* you used the sanitizer before performing wudu or prayer (though general hygiene is always encouraged).\n\n---\n\n### **What You Should Do:**\n\n1.  **Regarding Your Past Usage (Unknowingly):**\n    *   **No Sin:** Since you used it without knowledge, you bear no sin for having used it. In Islam, actions done out of genuine ignorance are generally excused.\n    *   **Rectification (if applicable):** If you prayed while your hands were \"impure\" (according to View 1) and you were genuinely unaware, your past prayers are generally accepted. The issue of purity only becomes relevant *once you know*.\n\n2.  **For Future Use:**\n    *   **Personal Choice and Conviction:** You can choose to follow the view that resonates most with you, or the one that is commonly adopted by scholars in your region.\n    *   **Prioritize Soap and Water:** Regardless of the scholarly view, washing hands with soap and water is always the most effective and universally accepted method for both physical cleanliness and ritual purity in Islam.\n    *   **Seek Alcohol-Free Alternatives:** If you prefer to be cautious or follow the stricter view, actively seek out alcohol-free hand sanitizers (many brands offer these now).\n    *   **If No Alternative is Available (and you follow View 1):** If you have to use an alcohol-based sanitizer and you intend to pray, it would be prudent to wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water afterwards to ensure ritual purity before performing wudu or prayer.\n    *   **If you follow View 2:** You can use them without concern for purity before prayer, especially out of necessity.\n\n---\n\n**In Summary:**\n\nThe consensus leans towards the permissibility of alcohol-based hand sanitizers for external use, particularly due to necessity and the understanding that the prohibition of alcohol primarily concerns consumption. However, there's a strong traditional view that considers it impure and advises washing it off before prayer.\n\nGiven that you used it unknowingly, there is no sin on you. For the future, you can decide which view you are comfortable following, keeping in mind that soap and water is always the best option for both hygiene and ritual purity."}
{"Question": "I have heard that its okay to consume any type of food containing wine, if the food has been boiled for a good amount of time, so that the wine evaporates. Is this permissible? ? --T--", "Answer": "In the name of Allah, Most Compassionate, Most Merciful Although conventional wisdom suggests that alcohol burns off after cooking, that does not hold true in most cases. The following is a chart prepared by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA): Alcohol Burn-off Chart Preparation MethodPercent Retained alcohol added to boiling liquid & removed from heat 85% alcohol flamed 75% no heat, stored overnight 70% baked, 25 minutes, alcohol not stirred into mixture 45% Baked/simmered dishes with alcohol stirred into mixture: 15 minutes cooking time 40% 30 minutes cooking time 35% 1 hour cooking time 25% 1.5 hours cooking time 20% 2 hours cooking time 10% 2.5 hours cooking time 5% (http://homecooking.about.com/library/archive/blalcohol12.htm) Since it is evident that at least some percentage of wine would still be retained in the food after cooking, eating the food in question would be forbidden. Jabir ibn `Abdullah (RA) reports: The Prophet (may Allahs peace and mercy be upon him) said: whatever intoxicates in a large quantity, a small quantity of it is forbidden. (Abu Dawood; similar tradition reported in Nasai) All four Sunni schools are unanimous on the prohibition of consuming wine in any quantity. As well, wine is a type of najasa (filth). With reference to wine, the classical Arabic Hanafi fiqh text Al-Hidayah states: It is filthsevere filth, similar to urine. (Al-Hidayah, Book of Drinks) As a result, the mixture would become filthy as soon as the wine is added to it. Hence, even if the wine were to evaporate after extensive boiling or cooking, it would make no difference. Deriving benefit from filth is forbidden. (Al-Hidayah, Book of Drinks) Therefore, consuming any food or mixture in which wine has been added is forbidden, regardless of how little of it is present in the finished product.

This prohibition is clear in the Quran (e.g., Surah Al-Ma'idah 5:90-91). The prohibition is not just about intoxication but also about the substance itself being considered impure (*najis*).\n\n2.  **The Concept of *Najasa* (Impurity):**\n    According to the vast majority of Islamic scholars across the four main Sunni schools of thought (Hanafi, Maliki, Shafi'i, Hanbali), wine is considered *najis* (ritually impure). When a *najis* substance comes into contact with a pure substance, it renders the pure substance impure, making it impermissible to consume.\n\n3.  **Does Boiling Remove the Impurity?**\n    This is the core of your question.\n    *   **Scientific Reality:** While a significant amount of alcohol might evaporate when boiled, especially over a long period, it's virtually impossible to completely remove *all* traces of alcohol. Even small residual amounts may remain. More importantly, the *essence* of the substance that was added was wine.\n    *   **Islamic Juristic View (Majority):** The mainstream opinion is that boiling *does not* render the food permissible. The reason is that the food was mixed with a *najis* substance (wine). Even if the intoxicating effect is removed or the alcohol content becomes negligible, the original impurity is generally considered to remain. The food item has been \"contaminated\" by the najis substance.\n    *   **Analogy:** Scholars often use the analogy of urine. If a drop of urine falls into a large pot of water, even if it's heavily diluted and undetectable by taste or smell, the water is still considered impure because a *najis* substance was added to it. The same logic is applied to wine.\n\n4.  **The Concept of *Istihalah* (Transformation):**\n    Some scholars discuss the concept of *istihalah*, which means a complete transformation of a substance into something else, which might change its ruling.\n    *   **Example where Istihalah applies:** If wine naturally turns into vinegar *without human intervention to force this transformation*, then the vinegar becomes permissible, as it has completely transformed into a different substance with different properties.\n    *   **Why it generally *doesn't* apply here:** Boiling wine in food is not considered *istihalah* by the majority. The wine itself hasn't transformed into a different substance; rather, its volatile components (alcohol) have evaporated. The original *najis* substance was still added to the food.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the overwhelming majority of Islamic scholars, it is **not permissible** to consume food that has had wine added to it, even if it has been boiled for a long time and the alcohol is believed to have evaporated. The reason is that the food was mixed with an impure substance (*najis*), and this impurity is generally considered to remain.\n\nTo avoid any doubt and adhere to the clear prohibitions, it's best to avoid any food prepared with wine or other alcoholic beverages."}
{"Question": "Q: I went to the toilet and I saw an impurity on the shower with which we do istinja. I did not have an option so I tried to avoid the impurity and used it as I was not clean and couldnt get up. Though while cleaning my hand touched that area and some of it came on my hand. Avoiding everything I managed to clean myself and put the shower back. While putting the shower back a few drops of water from my hands usually fall on the floor. Im not aware whether I stepped on those drops or not as I was cleaning the shower from the impurity. I then poured water on my feet I was wearing slippers and I poured water on my feet near the drain as there was no place to wash feet. I am not aware whether the water went till the base of my slipper to clean the water drops of that fell on the slipper base. I then stepped on the water left from the pouring and went out. Im worried that what if I have spread impurity in the house by walking with those slippers as the dirt from the slipper like mud etc was still there and Im not sure if the impure water drops have been cleaned or not.

So, he drank from that water and then went to the Zamzam (well) and there the people were offering water to the others and working at it (drawing water from the well). The Prophet then said to them, \"Carry on! You are doing a good deed.\" Then he said, \"Were I not afraid that other people would compete with you (in drawing water from Zamzam), I would certainly take the rope and put it over this (i.e. his shoulder) (to draw water).\" On saying that the Prophet pointed to his shoulder.<D>Narrated Jabir bin `Abdullah:Allahs Apostle and one of his companions entered upon an Ansari man and the Prophet said to him, \"If you have water kept overnight in a water skin, (give us), otherwise we will drink water by putting our mouth in it.\" The man was watering his garden then.

According to the agreed version, he then would wash the private part. He would then perform ablution as he did for prayer, then put his hands in the vessel and made the water go through his hair.

If some water was left, he would pour it also upon himself.<D>(And water gushing) from the leg of the Throne, <D>(In gardens and water springs) pure water<D>(Amid Gardens and water springs) springs of wine, water, milk and honey, ", "Generated_Answer": "It's completely understandable that you're feeling worried about this, especially when it comes to matters of purity in your home. However, based on your description, **it is highly unlikely that your house has become impure.**\n\nLet's break down the situation according to Islamic principles of purity (tahara):\n\n1.  **The Impurity on the Shower Head & Hand Contact:**\n    *   You did your best to avoid the impurity. This effort is acknowledged.\n    *   When your hand touched the area and \"some of it came on your hand,\" your hand *could* have become impure *at that moment*, especially if the impurity was wet and transferred.\n    *   However, you \"managed to clean yourself\" and *then* presumably handled the shower. If your hands were subsequently rinsed or cleaned during the process of istinja (which often involves water), the impurity on your hands might have been removed or diluted to a negligible amount. The general principle is that once impurity is removed by washing, the item becomes pure.\n\n2.  **Drops from Your Hands on the Floor:**\n    *   You are \"not aware whether I stepped on those drops or not.\" This is the crucial point. In Islam, certainty is not removed by doubt (*al-yaqeen la yuzalu bish-shakk*). The original state of the floor is purity. Unless you are *certain* you stepped on *impure* drops *and* those drops were wet enough and significant enough to transfer impurity to your feet/slippers, you should assume the floor remains pure.\n    *   Even if a tiny, unnoticeable amount of impurity *might* have been on the drops, if it's very little and difficult to avoid, it is generally overlooked in Islamic law due to the principle of ease and avoiding hardship.\n\n3.  **Washing Your Feet and Slippers:**\n    *   You poured water on your feet while wearing slippers. This is a valid method of purification.\n    *   Your concern about whether \"the water went till the base of my slipper to clean the water drops of that fell on the slipper base\" is a common *waswasa* (obsessive whisper/doubt). When you wash something with the intention of purification, and water visibly covers the area, it is considered pure. You don't need to meticulously check every single milliliter or assume impurity spread to the very base unless there's obvious evidence of a large amount of impurity there.\n    *   The \"dirt from the slipper like mud etc.\" is not *najasa* (impurity) unless it contains something impure (like urine or feces). Mud from outside is generally *tahir* (pure) in itself.\n\n4.  **Stepping on \"Leftover Water\" and Walking Out:**\n    *   The water \"left from the pouring\" near the drain is *not* impure. This is water that has been used for purification. Unless it is visibly discolored by a large amount of impurity or smells strongly of impurity, this water itself is considered pure or used (musta'mal) water, not impure water.\n    *   Therefore, stepping on it and walking out does not spread impurity.\n\n**Conclusion and Advice:**\n\n**No, your house is not impure.** All the points of doubt you raised should be dismissed. The default state of your house, your feet, and your slippers is purity. You should only assume impurity if you have absolute certainty, and based on your description, you do not.\n\nThis level of detailed concern and doubt is a sign of *waswasa* (obsessive whispering from Shaytan). Here's how to deal with it:\n\n*   **Ignore the Doubts:** The most effective way to combat *waswasa* is to simply ignore it. If you are not absolutely certain something is impure, assume it is pure. Do not re-wash, re-check, or overthink.\n*   **Assume Purity:** Always assume the default state of everything (floor, clothes, body, water) is purity unless you have clear, undeniable evidence to the contrary.\n*   **Ease in Religion:** Remember that Islam is a religion of ease. Allah does not burden a soul beyond what it can bear. Over-meticulousness in matters of purity goes against the spirit of the religion.\n*   **Focus on Certainty:** If you were *certain* you stepped in a large puddle of fresh, wet impurity, then you would deal with it. But \"not aware\" or \"what if\" scenarios should be dismissed.\n\nYou performed your istinja, you washed your feet, and you made an effort. Your house is clean. Put these worries behind you and do not let Shaytan trick you into these excessive doubts."}

And Allah Taala ( ) knows best", "Document": "Narrated Aisha:(the wife of the Prophet) \"Whenever Allahs Apostle intended to go on a journey, he would draw lots amongst his wives and would take with him the one upon whom the lot fell. During a Ghazwa of his, he drew lots amongst us and the lot fell upon me, and I proceeded with him after Allah had decreed the use of the veil by women. I was carried in a Howdah (on the camel) and dismounted while still in it. When Allahs Apostle was through with his Ghazwa and returned home, and we approached the city of Medina, Allahs Apostle ordered us to proceed at night. When the order of setting off was given, I walked till I was past the army to answer the call of nature. After finishing I returned (to the camp) to depart (with the others) and suddenly realized that my necklace over my chest was missing. So, I returned to look for it and was delayed because of that. The people who used to carry me on the camel, came to my Howdah and put it on the back of the camel, thinking that I was in it, as, at that time, women were light in weight, and thin and lean, and did not use to eat much. So, those people did not feel the difference in the heaviness of the Howdah while lifting it, and they put it over the camel. At that time I was a young lady. They set the camel moving and proceeded on. I found my necklace after the army had gone, and came to their camp to find nobody. So, I went to the place where I used to stay, thinking that they would discover my absence and come back in my search. While in that state, I felt sleepy and slept. Safwan bin Muattal As-Sulami Adh-Dhakwani was behind the army and reached my abode in the morning. When he saw a sleeping person, he came to me, and he used to see me before veiling. So, I got up when I heard him saying, \"Inna lil-lah-wa inn a ilaihi rajiun (We are for Allah, and we will return to Him).\" He made his camel knell down. He got down from his camel, and put his leg on the front legs of the camel and then I rode and sat over it. Safwan set out walking, leading the camel by the rope till we reached the army who had halted to take rest at midday. Then whoever was meant for destruction, fell into destruction, (some people accused me falsely) and the leader of the false accusers was `Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul. After that we returned to Medina, and I became ill for one month while the people were spreading the forged statements of the false accusers. I was feeling during my ailment as if I were not receiving the usual kindness from the Prophet which I used to receive from him when I got sick. But he would come, greet and say, How is that (girl)? I did not know anything of what was going on till I recovered from my ailment and went out with Um Mistah to the Manasi where we used to answer the call of nature, and we used not to go to answer the call of nature except from night to night and that was before we had lavatories near to our houses. And this habit of ours was similar to the habit of the old Arabs in the open country (or away from houses). So. I and Um Mistah bint Ruhm went out walking. Um Mistah stumbled because of her long dress and on that she said, Let Mistah be ruined. I said, You are saying a bad word. Why are you abusing a man who took part in (the battle of) Badr? She said, O Hanata (you there) didnt you hear what they said? Then she told me the rumors of the false accusers. My sickness was aggravated, and when I returned home, Allahs Apostle came to me, and after greeting he said, How is that (girl)? I requested him to allow me to go to my parents. I wanted then to be sure of the news through them I Allahs Apostle allowed me, and I went to my parents and asked my mother, What are the people talking about? She said, O my daughter! Dont worry much about this matter. By Allah, never is there a charming woman loved by her husband who has other wives, but the women would forge false news about her. I said, Glorified be Allah! Are the people really taking of this matter? That night I kept on weeping and could not sleep till morning. In the morning Allahs Apostle called `Ali bin Abu Talib and Usama bin Zaid when he saw the Divine Inspiration delayed, to consul them about divorcing his wife (i.e. `Aisha). Usama bin Zaid said what he knew of the good reputation of his wives and added, O Allahs Apostle! Keep you wife, for, by Allah, we know nothing about her but good. `Ali bin Abu Talib said, O Allahs Apostle! Allah has no imposed restrictions on you, and there are many women other than she, yet you may ask the woman-servant who will tell you the truth. On that Allahs Apostle called Buraira and said, O Burair. Did you ever see anything which roused your suspicions about her? Buraira said, No, by Allah Who has sent you with the Truth, I have never seen in her anything faulty except that she is a girl of immature age, who sometimes sleeps and leaves the dough for the goats to eat. On that day Allahs Apostle ascended the pulpit and requested that somebody support him in punishing `Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul. Allahs Apostle said, Who will support me to punish that person (`Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul) who has hurt me by slandering the reputation of my family? By Allah, I know nothing about my family but good, and they have accused a person about whom I know nothing except good, and he never entered my house except in my company. Sa`d bin Mu`adh got up and said, O Allahs Apostle! by Allah, I will relieve you from him. If that man is from the tribe of the Aus, then we will chop his head off, and if he is from our brothers, the Khazraj, then order us, and we will fulfill your order. On that Sa`d bin Ubada, the chief of the Khazraj and before this incident, he had been a pious man, got up, motivated by his zeal for his tribe and said, By Allah, you have told a lie; you cannot kill him, and you will never be able to kill him. On that Usaid bin Al-Hadir got up and said (to Sa`d bin Ubada), By Allah! you are a liar. By Allah, we will kill him; and you are a hypocrite, defending the hypocrites. On this the two tribes of Aus and Khazraj got excited and were about to fight each other, while Allahs Apostle was standing on the pulpit. He got down and quieted them till they became silent and he kept quiet. On that day I kept on weeping so much so that neither did my tears stop, nor could I sleep. In the morning my parents were with me and I had wept for two nights and a day, till I thought my liver would burst from weeping. While they were sitting with me and I was weeping, an Ansari woman asked my permission to enter, and I allowed her to come in. She sat down and started weeping with me. While we were in this state, Allahs Apostle came and sat down and he had never sat with me since the day they forged the accusation. No revelation regarding my case came to him for a month. He recited Tashah-hud (i.e. None has the right to be worshipped but Allah and Muhammad is His Apostle) and then said, O `Aisha! I have been informed such-and-such about you; if you are innocent, then Allah will soon reveal your innocence, and if you have committed a sin, then repent to Allah and ask Him to forgive you, for when a person confesses his sin and asks Allah for forgiveness, Allah accepts his repentance. When Allahs Apostle finished his speech my tears ceased completely and there remained not even a single drop of it. I requested my father to reply to Allahs Apostle on my behalf. My father said, By Allah, I do not know what to say to Allahs Apostle. I said to my mother, Talk to Allahs Apostle on my behalf. She said, By Allah, I do not know what to say to Allahs Apostle. I was a young girl and did not have much knowledge of the Quran. I said. I know, by Allah, that you have listened to what people are saying and that has been planted in your minds and you have taken it as a truth. Now, if I told you that I am innocent and Allah knows that I am innocent, you would not believe me and if I confessed to you falsely that I am guilty, and Allah knows that I am innocent you would believe me. By Allah, I dont compare my situation with you except to the situation of Josephs father (i.e. Jacob) who said, So (for me) patience is most fitting against that which you assert and it is Allah (Alone) whose help can be sought. Then I turned to the other side of my bed hoping that Allah would prove my innocence. By Allah I never thought that Allah would reveal Divine Inspiration in my case, as I considered myself too inferior to be talked of in the Holy Quran. I had hoped that Allahs Apostle might have a dream in which Allah would prove my innocence. By Allah, Allahs Apostle had not got up and nobody had left the house before the Divine Inspiration came to Allahs Apostle. So, there overtook him the same state which used to overtake him, (when he used to have, on being inspired divinely). He was sweating so much so that the drops of the sweat were dropping like pearls though it was a (cold) wintry day. When that state of Allahs Apostle was over, he was smiling and the first word he said, `Aisha! Thank Allah, for Allah has declared your innocence. My mother told me to go to Allahs Apostle . I replied, By Allah I will not go to him and will not thank but Allah. So Allah revealed: \"Verily! They who spread the slander are a gang among you . . .\" (24.11) When Allah gave the declaration of my Innocence, Abu Bakr, who used to provide for Mistah bin Uthatha for he was his relative, said, By Allah, I will never provide Mistah with anything because of what he said about Aisha. But Allah later revealed: -- \"And let not those who are good and wealthy among you swear not to help their kinsmen, those in need and those who left their homes in Allahs Cause. Let them forgive and overlook. Do you not wish that Allah should forgive you? Verily! Allah is Oft-forgiving, Most Merciful.\" (24.22) After that Abu Bakr said, Yes ! By Allah! I like that Allah should forgive me, and resumed helping Mistah whom he used to help before. Allahs Apostle also asked Zainab bint Jahsh (i.e. the Prophets wife about me saying, What do you know and what did you see? She replied, O Allahs Apostle! I refrain to claim hearing or seeing what I have not heard or seen. By Allah, I know nothing except goodness about Aisha.\" Aisha further added \"Zainab was competing with me (in her beauty and the Prophets love), yet Allah protected her (from being malicious), for she had piety.\"<D>Narrated Aisha:(The wife of the Prophet) Whenever Allahs Apostle intended to go on a journey, he used to draw lots among his wives and would take with him the one on whom the lot had fallen. Once he drew lots when he wanted to carry out a Ghazwa, and the lot came upon me. So I proceeded with Allahs Apostle after Allahs order of veiling (the women) had been revealed and thus I was carried in my howdah (on a camel) and dismounted while still in it. We carried on our journey, and when Allahs Apostle had finished his Ghazwa and returned and we approached Medina, Allahs Apostle ordered to proceed at night. When the army was ordered to resume the homeward journey, I got up and walked on till I left the army (camp) behind. When I had answered the call of nature, I went towards my howdah, but behold ! A necklace of mine made of Jaz Azfar (a kind of black bead) was broken and I looked for it and my search for it detained me. The group of people who used to carry me, came and carried my howdah on to the back of my camel on which I was riding, considering that I was therein. At that time women were light in weight and were not fleshy for they used to eat little (food), so those people did not feel the lightness of the howdah while raising it up, and I was still a young lady. They drove away the camel and proceeded. Then I found my necklace after the army had gone. I came to their camp but found nobody therein so I went to the place where I used to stay, thinking that they would miss me and come back in my search. While I was sitting at my place, I felt sleepy and slept. Safwan bin Al-Muattil As-Sulami Adh- Dhakw-ani was behind the army. He had started in the last part of the night and reached my stationing place in the morning and saw the figure of a sleeping person. He came to me and recognized me on seeing me for he used to see me before veiling. I got up because of his saying: \"Inna Li l-lahi wa inna ilaihi rajiun,\" which he uttered on recognizing me. I covered my face with my garment, and by Allah, he did not say to me a single word except, \"Inna Li l-lahi wa inna ilaihi rajiun,\" till he made his shecamel kneel down whereupon he trod on its forelegs and I mounted it. Then Safwan set out, leading the she-camel that was carrying me, till we met the army while they were resting during the hot midday. Then whoever was meant for destruction, fell in destruction, and the leader of the Ifk (forged statement) was `Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul. After this we arrived at Medina and I became ill for one month while the people were spreading the forged statements of the people of the Ifk, and I was not aware of anything thereof. But what aroused my doubt while I was sick, was that I was no longer receiving from Allahs Apostle the same kindness as I used to receive when I fell sick. Allahs Apostle would enter upon me, say a greeting and add, \"How is that (lady)?\" and then depart. That aroused my suspicion but I was not aware of the propagated evil till I recovered from my ailment. I went out with Um Mistah to answer the call of nature towards Al-Manasi, the place where we used to relieve ourselves, and used not to go out for this purpose except from night to night, and that was before we had lavatories close to our houses. And this habit of ours was similar to the habit of the old Arabs (in the deserts or in the tents) concerning the evacuation of the bowels, for we considered it troublesome and harmful to take lavatories in the houses. So I went out with Um Mistah who was the daughter of Abi Ruhm bin `Abd Manaf, and her mother was daughter of Sakhr bin Amir who was the aunt of Abi Bakr As-Siddiq, and her son was Mistah bin Uthatha. When we had finished our affair, Um Mistah and I came back towards my house. Um Mistah stumbled over her robe whereupon she said, \"Let Mistah be ruined ! \" I said to her, \"What a bad word you have said! Do you abuse a man who has taken part in the Battle of Badr? She said, \"O you there! Didnt you hear what he has said?\" I said, \"And what did he say?\" She then told me the statement of the people of the Ifk (forged statement) which added to my ailment. When I returned home, Allahs Apostle came to me, and after greeting, he said, \"How is that (lady)?\" I said, \"Will you allow me to go to my parents?\" At that time I intended to be sure of the news through them. Allahs Apostle allowed me and I went to my parents and asked my mother, \"O my mother! What are the people talking about?\" My mother said, \"O my daughter! Take it easy, for by Allah, there is no charming lady who is loved by her husband who has other wives as well, but that those wives would find fault with her.\" I said, \"Subhan Allah! Did the people really talk about that?\" That night I kept on weeping the whole night till the morning. My tears never stopped, nor did I sleep, and morning broke while I was still weeping, Allahs Apostle called `Ali bin Abi Talib and Usama bin Zaid when the Divine Inspiration delayed, in order to consult them as to the idea of divorcing his wife. Usama bin Zaid told Allahs Apostle of what he knew about the innocence of his wife and of his affection he kept for her. He said, \"O Allahs Apostle! She is your wife, and we do not know anything about her except good.\" But `Ali bin Abi Talib said, \"O Allahs Apostle! Allah does not impose restrictions on you; and there are plenty of women other than her. If you however, ask (her) slave girl, she will tell you the truth.\" `Aisha added: So Allahs Apostle called for Barira and said, \"O Barira! Did you ever see anything which might have aroused your suspicion? (as regards Aisha). Barira said, \"By Allah Who has sent you with the truth, I have never seen anything regarding Aisha which I would blame her for except that she is a girl of immature age who sometimes sleeps and leaves the dough of her family unprotected so that the domestic goats come and eat it.\" So Allahs Apostle got up (and addressed) the people an asked for somebody who would take revenge on `Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul then. Allahs Apostle, while on the pulpit, said, \"O Muslims! Who will help me against a man who has hurt me by slandering my family? By Allah, I know nothing except good about my family, and people have blamed a man of whom I know nothing except good, and he never used to visit my family except with me,\" Sa`d bin Mu`adh Al-Ansari got up and said, \"O Allahs Apostle! By Allah, I will relieve you from him. If he be from the tribe of (Bani) Al-Aus, then I will chop his head off; and if he be from our brethren, the Khazraj, then you give us your order and we will obey it.\" On that, Sa`d bin Ubada got up, and he was the chief of the Khazraj, and before this incident he had been a pious man but he was incited by his zeal for his tribe. He said to Sa`d (bin Mu`adh), \"By Allah the Eternal, you have told a lie! You shall not kill him and you will never be able to kill him!\" On that, Usaid bin Hudair, the cousin of Sa`d (bin Mu`adh) got up and said to Sa`d bin Ubada, \"You are a liar! By Allah the Eternal, we will surely kill him; and you are a hypocrite defending the hypocrites!\" So the two tribes of Al-Aus and Al-Khazraj got excited till they were on the point of fighting with each other while Allahs Apostle was standing on the pulpit. Allahs Apostle continued quietening them till they became silent whereupon he became silent too. On that day I kept on weeping so much that neither did my tears stop, nor could I sleep. In the morning my parents were with me, and I had wept for two nights and a day without sleeping and with incessant tears till they thought that my liver would burst with weeping. While they were with me and I was weeping, an Ansari woman asked permission to see me. I admitted her and she sat and started weeping with me. While I was in that state, Allahs Apostle came to us, greeted, and sat down,. He had never sat with me since the day what was said, was said. He had stayed a month without receiving any Divine Inspiration concerning my case. Allahs Apostle recited the Tashahhud after he had sat down, and then said, \"Thereafter, O `Aisha! I have been informed such and-such a thing about you; and if you are innocent, Allah will reveal your innocence, and if you have committed a sin, then ask for Allahs forgiveness and repent to Him, for when a slave confesses his sin and then repents to Allah, Allah accepts his repentance.\" When Allahs Apostle had finished his speech, my tears ceased completely so that I no longer felt even a drop thereof. Then I said to my father, \"Reply to Allahs Apostle on my behalf as to what he said.\" He said, \"By Allah, I do not know what to say to Allahs Apostle.\" Then I said to my mother, \"Reply to Allahs Apostle.\" She said, \"I do not know what to say to Allahs Apostle.\" Still a young girl as I was and though I had little knowledge of Quran, I said, \"By Allah, I know that you heard this story (of the Ifk) so much so that it has been planted in your minds and you have believed it. So now, if I tell you that I am innocent, and Allah knows that I am innocent, you will not believe me; and if I confess something, and Allah knows that I am innocent of it, you will believe me. By Allah, I cannot find of you an example except that of Josephs father: \"So (for me) patience is most fitting against that which you assert and it is Allah (Alone) Whose help can be sought. Then I turned away and lay on my bed, and at that time I knew that I was innocent and that Allah would reveal my innocence. But by Allah, I never thought that Allah would sent down about my affair, Divine Inspiration that would be recited (forever), as I considered myself too unworthy to be talked of by Allah with something that was to be recited: but I hoped that Allahs Apostle might have a vision in which Allah would prove my innocence. By Allah, Allahs Apostle had not left his seat and nobody had left the house when the Divine Inspiration came to Allahs Apostle . So there overtook him the same hard condition which used to overtake him (when he was Divinely Inspired) so that the drops of his sweat were running down, like pearls, though it was a (cold) winter day, and that was because of the heaviness of the Statement which was revealed to him. When that state of Allahs Apostle was over, and he was smiling when he was relieved, the first word he said was, \"Aisha, Allah has declared your innocence.\" My mother said to me, \"Get up and go to him.\" I said, \"By Allah, I will not go to him and I will not thank anybody but Allah.\" So Allah revealed: \"Verily! They who spread the Slander are a gang among you. Think it not....\" (24.11-20). When Allah revealed this to confirm my innocence, Abu Bakr As-Siddiq who used to provide for Mistah bin Uthatha because of the latters kinship to him and his poverty, said, \"By Allah, I will never provide for Mistah anything after what he has said about Aisha\". So Allah revealed: (continued...) (continuing... 1): -6.274:... ... \"Let not those among you who are good and are wealthy swear not to give (help) to their kinsmen, those in need, and those who have left their homes for Allahs Cause. Let them Pardon and forgive (i.e. do not punish them). Do you not love that should forgive you? Verily Allah is Oft-forgiving. Most Merciful.\" (24.22) Abu Bakr said, \"Yes, by Allah, I wish that Allah should forgive me.\" So he resumed giving Mistah the aid he used to give him before and said, \"By Allah, I will never withold it from him at all.\" Aisha further said: Allahs Apostle also asked Zainab bint Jahsh about my case. He said, \"O Zainab! What have you seen?\" She replied, \"O Allahs Apostle! I protect my hearing and my sight (by refraining from telling lies). I know nothing but good (about Aisha).\" Of all the wives of Allahs Apostle, it was Zainab who aspired to receive from him the same favor as I used to receive, yet, Allah saved her (from telling lies) because of her piety. But her sister, Hamna, kept on fighting on her behalf so she was destroyed as were those who invented and spread the slander.<D>Narrated Ibn `Abbas:The first lady to use a girdle was the mother of Ishmael. She used a girdle so that she might hide her tracks from Sarah. Abraham brought her and her son Ishmael while she was suckling him, to a place near the Ka`ba under a tree on the spot of Zamzam, at the highest place in the mosque. During those days there was nobody in Mecca, nor was there any water So he made them sit over there and placed near them a leather bag containing some dates, and a small water-skin containing some water, and set out homeward. Ishmaels mother followed him saying, \"O Abraham! Where are you going, leaving us in this valley where there is no person whose company we may enjoy, nor is there anything (to enjoy)?\" She repeated that to him many times, but he did not look back at her Then she asked him, \"Has Allah ordered you to do so?\" He said, \"Yes.\" She said, \"Then He will not neglect us,\" and returned while Abraham proceeded onwards, and on reaching the Thaniya where they could not see him, he faced the Ka`ba, and raising both hands, invoked Allah saying the following prayers: O our Lord! I have made some of my offspring dwell in a valley without cultivation, by Your Sacred House (Ka`ba at Mecca) in order, O our Lord, that they may offer prayer perfectly. So fill some hearts among men with love towards them, and (O Allah) provide them with fruits, so that they may give thanks. (14.37) Ishmaels mother went on suckling Ishmael and drinking from the water (she had). When the water in the water-skin had all been used up, she became thirsty and her child also became thirsty. She started looking at him (i.e. Ishmael) tossing in agony; She left him, for she could not endure looking at him, and found that the mountain of Safa was the nearest mountain to her on that land. She stood on it and started looking at the valley keenly so that she might see somebody, but she could not see anybody. Then she descended from Safa and when she reached the valley, she tucked up her robe and ran in the valley like a person in distress and trouble, till she crossed the valley and reached the Marwa mountain where she stood and started looking, expecting to see somebody, but she could not see anybody. She repeated that (running between Safa and Marwa) seven times.\" The Prophet said, \"This is the source of the tradition of the walking of people between them (i.e. Safa and Marwa). When she reached the Marwa (for the last time) she heard a voice and she asked herself to be quiet and listened attentively. She heard the voice again and said, O, (whoever you may be)! You have made me hear your voice; have you got something to help me?\" And behold! She saw an angel at the place of Zamzam, digging the earth with his heel (or his wing), till water flowed from that place. She started to make something like a basin around it, using her hand in this way, and started filling her water-skin with water with her hands, and the water was flowing out after she had scooped some of it.\" The Prophet added, \"May Allah bestow Mercy on Ishmaels mother! Had she let the Zamzam (flow without trying to control it) (or had she not scooped from that water) (to fill her water-skin), Zamzam would have been a stream flowing on the surface of the earth.\" The Prophet further added, \"Then she drank (water) and suckled her child. The angel said to her, Dont be afraid of being neglected, for this is the House of Allah which will be built by this boy and his father, and Allah never neglects His people. The House (i.e. Ka`ba) at that time was on a high place resembling a hillock, and when torrents came, they flowed to its right and left. She lived in that way till some people from the tribe of Jurhum or a family from Jurhum passed by her and her child, as they (i.e. the Jurhum people) were coming through the way of Kada. They landed in the lower part of Mecca where they saw a bird that had the habit of flying around water and not leaving it. They said, This bird must be flying around water, though we know that there is no water in this valley. They sent one or two messengers who discovered the source of water, and returned to inform them of the water. So, they all came (towards the water).\" The Prophet added, \"Ishmaels mother was sitting near the water. They asked her, Do you allow us to stay with you?\" She replied, Yes, but you will have no right to possess the water. They agreed to that.\" The Prophet further said, \"Ishmaels mother was pleased with the whole situation as she used to love to enjoy the company of the people. So, they settled there, and later on they sent for their families who came and settled with them so that some families became permanent residents there. The child (i.e. Ishmael) grew up and learnt Arabic from them and (his virtues) caused them to love and admire him as he grew up, and when he reached the age of puberty they made him marry a woman from amongst them. After Ishmaels mother had died, Abraham came after Ishmaels marriage in order to see his family that he had left before, but he did not find Ishmael there. When he asked Ishmaels wife about him, she replied, He has gone in search of our livelihood. Then he asked her about their way of living and their condition, and she replied, We are living in misery; we are living in hardship and destitution, complaining to him. He said, When your husband returns, convey my salutation to him and tell him to change the threshold of the gate (of his house). When Ishmael came, he seemed to have felt something unusual, so he asked his wife, Has anyone visited you? She replied, Yes, an old man of so-and-so description came and asked me about you and I informed him, and he asked about our state of living, and I told him that we were living in a hardship and poverty. On that Ishmael said, Did he advise you anything? She replied, Yes, he told me to convey his salutation to you and to tell you to change the threshold of your gate. Ishmael said, It was my father, and he has ordered me to divorce you. Go back to your family. So, Ishmael divorced her and married another woman from amongst them (i.e. Jurhum). Then Abraham stayed away from them for a period as long as Allah wished and called on them again but did not find Ishmael. So he came to Ishmaels wife and asked her about Ishmael. She said, He has gone in search of our livelihood. Abraham asked her, How are you getting on? asking her about their sustenance and living. She replied, We are prosperous and well-off (i.e. we have everything in abundance). Then she thanked Allah Abraham said, What kind of food do you eat? She said. Meat. He said, What do you drink? She said, Water.\" He said, \"O Allah! Bless their meat and water.\" The Prophet added, \"At that time they did not have grain, and if they had grain, he would have also invoked Allah to bless it.\" The Prophet added, \"If somebody has only these two things as his sustenance, his health and disposition will be badly affected, unless he lives in Mecca.\" The Prophet added,\" Then Abraham said Ishmaels wife, \"When your husband comes, give my regards to him and tell him that he should keep firm the threshold of his gate. When Ishmael came back, he asked his wife, Did anyone call on you? She replied, Yes, a good-looking old man came to me, so she praised him and added. He asked about you, and I informed him, and he asked about our livelihood and I told him that we were in a good condition. Ishmael asked her, Did he give you any piece of advice? She said, Yes, he told me to give his regards to you and ordered that you should keep firm the threshold of your gate. On that Ishmael said, It was my father, and you are the threshold (of the gate). He has ordered me to keep you with me. Then Abraham stayed away from them for a period as long as Allah wished, and called on them afterwards. He saw Ishmael under a tree near Zamzam, sharpening his arrows. When he saw Abraham, he rose up to welcome him (and they greeted each other as a father does with his son or a son does with his father). Abraham said, O Ishmael! Allah has given me an order. Ishmael said, Do what your Lord has ordered you to do. Abraham asked, Will you help me? Ishmael said, I will help you. Abraham said, Allah has ordered me to build a house here, pointing to a hillock higher than the land surrounding it.\" The Prophet added, \"Then they raised the foundations of the House (i.e. the Ka`ba). Ishmael brought the stones and Abraham was building, and when the walls became high, Ishmael brought this stone and put it for Abraham who stood over it and carried on building, while Ishmael was handing him the stones, and both of them were saying, O our Lord! Accept (this service) from us, Verily, You are the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing. The Prophet added, \"Then both of them went on building and going round the Ka`ba saying: O our Lord ! Accept (this service) from us, Verily, You are the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing.\" (2.127)<D>Allah then went back to His saying: (Divorce must be pronounced twice) saying: (And if he hath divorced her) i.e. the third time, (then she is not lawful unto him thereafter) after the third divorce (until she hath wedded another husband) and the marriage must be consummated. (Then if he (the other husband) divorce her) this was revealed about Abd al-Rahman Ibn al-Zubayr, (it is no sin for both of them) the first husband and the woman (that they come together again) with a new dowry and marriage contract (if they consider) if they know (that they are able to observe the limits of Allah) the rulings of Allah regulating the relationship between husband and wife. (These are the limits of Allah) these are Allahs rulings andobligations. (He manifesteth them for people who have knowledge) they are from Allah and believe them tobe so. <D>(Divorce must be pronounced twice) He says: the divorce in which a man is entitled to take back his wife is pronounced once on two separate occasions (and then (a woman) must be retained) before she is pronounced divorced a third time and before performing major ritual ablution from the third menstruation (in honour) with kind companionship and intercourse (or released in kindness) or divorced a third time with such kindness as restores her rights. (And it is not lawful for you that ye take from women aught of that which ye have given them) of dowry; (except (in the case) when both arbiters) when the husband and wifeboth know that she wants to ransom her divorce (fear that they may not be able to keep the limits (imposed by) Allah) the rulings of Allah regulating the relationship between husband and wife. (And if ye fear) if you know (that they may not be able to keep the limits (imposed by) Allah) the rulings of Allah regulating the relationship between husband and wife, (in that case it is no sin for either of them) and especially the husband (if the woman ransom herself) if the husband takes what the woman ransoms herself with, out of the generosity of her soul. This verse was revealed about Thabit Ibn Qays Ibn Shammas whose wife Jamilah was the daughter of Abdullah Ibn Ubayy Ibn Salul, chief of the hypocrites. This woman ransomed her divorce from her husband by giving him back what he gave her as dowry. (These are the limits of Allah) the rulings of Allah regulating the relationship between husband and wife, (Transgress them not) do not step beyond that which Allah has prohibited. (For whoso transgresseth Allahs limits) steps beyond them: (such are wrong-doers) harmful to themselves.<D>(And the wife of Pharaoh) Asiyah Bint Muzahim, who was Moses aunt (said: (He will be)) this child will be (a consolation for me and for you) O Pharaoh. (Kill him not. Peradventure he may be of use to us) in our farm, (or we may choose him for a son) or adopt him as a son. (And they perceived not) the Children of Israel did not know that he was not from them; it is also said that this means: and they did not know that their destruction will be at his hands.", "Generated_Answer": "My dear sister, may Allah ease your suffering, lighten your burden, and fill your heart with peace, tranquility, and happiness. Your pain is palpable in your words, and it is absolutely *not* too much to ask for peace, to breathe, to live, and to be happy. These are fundamental rights that Allah desires for His creation.\n\nIt is deeply distressing to read what you are going through, and know that you are not alone in your struggles. Many people face immense difficulties, and reaching out to Allah, as you do every day, is the most powerful step you can take.\n\nLet's address your questions with practical advice and duas rooted in our beautiful Deen.\n\n---\n\n### **1. Getting Rid of Panic Attacks & Constant Fear**\n\nFirst and foremost, let me affirm: **YES, your stress, depression, and the immense loneliness from your husband's absence absolutely *do* count as primary reasons for your panic attacks and fear.** The human mind and body are profoundly affected by our circumstances and emotional well-being. While spiritual ailments (like evil eye or jinn) can exist, they are often secondary or non-existent in cases where severe emotional and psychological distress is the clear cause. Be very wary of websites that immediately attribute all problems to \"saya\" without considering the very real and valid human experiences of grief, loss, stress, and loneliness.\n\nHere's a multi-faceted approach:\n\n**A. Powerful Duas & Adhkar (Remembrance of Allah):**\n\n*   **Dua for Anxiety and Grief (Prophetic Dua):** This is one of the most comprehensive and comforting duas for your situation. Recite it frequently, with full understanding and conviction:\n    *   **Transliteration:** *Allahumma inni a’udhu bika minal-hammi wal-hazan, wal-‘ajzi wal-kasal, wal-bukhli wal-jubn, wa dal’id-dayn, wa ghalabatir-rijal.*\n    *   **Meaning:** \"O Allah, I seek refuge in You from anxiety and sorrow, weakness and laziness, miserliness and cowardice, the burden of debts and from being overpowered by men.\"\n    *   **Another related Prophetic Dua:** *Ya Hayyu, Ya Qayyumu, bi-rahmatika astagheeth.* (O The Ever-Living, O The Sustainer, I seek help through Your Mercy). Recite this abundantly.\n\n*   **Surah Al-Falaq and Surah An-Naas:** You are already reading these, which is excellent. Continue reading them, and add **Surah Al-Ikhlas** as well, three times each, morning and evening, and before sleeping. These three Surahs are powerful protectors.\n\n*   **Ayatul Kursi:** Recite Ayatul Kursi after every fard prayer, before sleeping, and whenever you feel fear or panic. It is the greatest verse in the Quran for protection.\n\n*   **Hasbunallahu wa Ni'mal Wakeel:** \"Allah (Alone) is sufficient for us, and He is the best Disposer of affairs.\" (Quran 3:173). This dhikr instills deep reliance on Allah and removes fear of creation. Recite it whenever panic arises.\n\n*   **La ilaha illa Anta Subhanaka Inni Kuntu Minaz-Zalimin:** \"There is no deity except You; exalted are You. Indeed, I have been of the wrongdoers.\" (Quran 21:87). This is Prophet Yunus' (AS) dua, which saved him from three layers of darkness. It is incredibly potent for distress.\n\n*   **Frequent Istighfar (Seeking Forgiveness):** *Astaghfirullah wa atubu ilayh* (I seek Allah's forgiveness and repent to Him). This cleanses sins and opens doors of relief.\n\n*   **Salawat (Prayers upon the Prophet Muhammad ﷺ):** Sending blessings upon the Prophet ﷺ brings immense peace, answers duas, and removes worries. Recite: *Allahumma Salli 'ala Muhammad wa 'ala ali Muhammad.* (O Allah, send blessings upon Muhammad and the family of Muhammad).\n\n**B. Quran Recitation for Healing (Ruqyah with Self-Care):**\n\n*   **Your Own Recitation:** The best \"Ruqyah\" is your own recitation of the Quran. Read Surah Al-Baqarah daily if you can, or at least play its recitation in your home. The Prophet ﷺ said, \"Recite Surah Al-Baqarah, for taking it is a blessing and leaving it is a regret, and the magicians cannot withstand it.\" Even if you don't believe in \"saya,\" its presence brings blessings and peace to the home.\n*   **Avoid Paid \"Healers\":** Be extremely cautious of people who claim to perform Ruqyah for money, or use strange methods, talismans, or speak in riddles. Authentic Ruqyah is simply recitation of Quran and Sunnah duas. The Quran is a healing for the hearts, not a business commodity.\n\n**C. Practical & Therapeutic Steps (Integrated with Islamic Principles):**\n\n*   **Seek Professional Help:** There is absolutely no shame or contradiction in Islam for seeking help from qualified mental health professionals (therapists, counselors). Just as you would see a doctor for a physical ailment, a therapist can provide tools and strategies to manage panic attacks, process trauma, and cope with depression and loneliness. This is using the means Allah has provided.\n*   **Understand Your Triggers:** Try to identify what specifically triggers your panic attacks. Is it thoughts about your husband? Loneliness at night? Financial worries? Once you know, you can better prepare or avoid certain situations where possible.\n*   **Mindfulness & Breathing Exercises:** When a panic attack starts, focus on your breath. Inhale slowly for 4 counts, hold for 4, exhale slowly for 6-8 counts. This helps regulate your nervous system. Pair this with Dhikr: \"La ilaha illAllah\" on the inhale, \"Muhammadur Rasulullah\" on the exhale, or simply \"Allah\" with each breath.\n*   **Structure Your Day:** Loneliness can be crippling. Try to create a routine that includes productive activities, self-care, and connecting with others.\n*   **Connect with Others:** Reach out to trusted family members, friends, or a supportive Islamic community. Don't isolate yourself. Even talking on the phone can help.\n*   **Physical Activity:** Even a short walk outdoors can significantly improve mood and reduce anxiety.\n*   **Healthy Lifestyle:** Ensure you're eating nutritious food and getting enough sleep. Sleep deprivation exacerbates anxiety.\n*   **Sujood (Prostration):** Prolong your prostrations in prayer. Pour out your heart to Allah in sujood. This is the closest a servant can be to their Lord, and it is incredibly calming.\n*   **Gratitude (Shukr):** Even amidst immense difficulty, try to find small things to be grateful for. \"If you are grateful, I will surely increase you [in favor].\" (Quran 14:7). This shifts focus and invites blessings.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Your Husband & Marital Situation**\n\nMy heart goes out to you for enduring 7 years of this emotional abandonment. This is an immense trial. You deserve to be cared for, supported, and to have a fulfilling marriage.\n\n**A. Duas for Your Husband and Marriage:**\n\n*   **Dua for Reconciliation and Softening Hearts:**\n    *   *Allahumma allif bayna qulubina, wa aslih dhata baynina, wahdina subulas-salam.*\n    *   **Meaning:** \"O Allah, unite our hearts, mend our differences, and guide us to the ways of peace.\" (Recite with your husband in mind).\n    *   *Rabbana hab lana min azwajina wa dhurriyatina qurrata a'yunin waj'alna lil-muttaqina imama.*\n    *   **Meaning:** \"Our Lord, grant us from among our wives and offspring comfort to our eyes and make us leaders for the righteous.\" (Quran 25:74). Recite this for a righteous spouse and family life.\n\n*   **Dua for Guidance for Your Husband:**\n    *   Make specific dua for him to realize his responsibilities, to fear Allah regarding his treatment of you, and for Allah to soften his heart towards you. For example: *Allahumma hadhihi zawji, la amliku laha illa ma ataytani, Allahumma hadini ila al-kheir li'ajliha, wa hadini ila al-kheir wa hadini ila al-kheir.* (O Allah, this is my husband, I own nothing for him except what You have given me. O Allah, guide me to good for his sake, and guide him to good and guide him to good.) You can personalize this in your own words.\n\n*   **Istikhara (Guidance Prayer):** If you are considering any major decision regarding your marriage (e.g., whether to continue waiting, whether to seek mediation, etc.), pray Istikhara. Allah will guide you to what is best, even if the path is difficult.\n\n**B. Practical Considerations (Alongside Dua):**\n\n*   **Communication:** Have you tried to have a direct, calm, and clear conversation with him about your feelings and his responsibilities? Sometimes men are unaware of the depth of the pain they cause. If it's safe and possible, express what you need explicitly.\n*   **Mediation:** If direct communication isn't fruitful, is there a respected family elder from either side, or an Islamic scholar/counselor, who could mediate and speak to him about his Islamic obligations towards you? A husband has clear rights and responsibilities in Islam.\n*   **Your Rights:** While you pray for him to change, it's also important to know your Islamic rights as a wife. A husband is obligated to support his wife financially and emotionally. If he is willfully neglecting you for 7 years without valid reason, this is a serious breach of trust and Islamic duty.\n*   **Seeking Advice from Scholars:** Consult a trusted, knowledgeable Islamic scholar (preferably a female scholar if possible) who can advise you on your options and rights in this challenging situation, including the implications of such a long separation without contact or support. They can guide you on what is permissible and advisable from an Islamic legal perspective (e.g., khula, divorce if necessary, or steps for reconciliation).\n\n---\n\n### **Regarding Darood Tanjina:**\n\nYou asked, \"some say read darood tanjina, some say don't?\"\n\n**My advice is to avoid Darood Tanjina.**\n\n*   **Reason:** Darood Tanjina is not authentically reported from the Prophet Muhammad ﷺ (peace be upon him) or from his Companions. It is a compilation that emerged much later, and its wording is not part of the Sunnah. While the intention might be good, it's always best to stick to the forms of Salawat that are authentically established in the Quran and Sunnah.\n*   **What to do instead:** You can achieve the same, or even greater, blessings and benefit by reciting the simple, authentic forms of Salawat, such as:\n    *   *Allahumma Salli 'ala Muhammad wa 'ala ali Muhammad.* (O Allah, send blessings upon Muhammad and the family of Muhammad).\n    *   *Allahumma Salli 'ala Muhammadin 'Abdika wa Rasulika An-Nabiyyil-Ummiy.* (O Allah, send blessings upon Muhammad, Your servant and Your Messenger, the unlettered Prophet).\n    *   The complete *Salawat Ibrahimiyyah* (the one you recite in your Salah during Tashahhud) is the most virtuous.\n\nAuthentic Salawat carries immense rewards and blessings, purifies the heart, and removes worries. There is no need to resort to unverified forms when the verified ones are so powerful and abundant.\n\n---\n\n**In summary, my dear sister:**\n\n1.  **Validate Your Feelings:** Your panic and stress are real and valid responses to immense hardship.\n2.  **Holistic Approach to Panic:** Combine powerful, authentic Quranic duas and Prophetic supplications with seeking professional therapeutic help. This is a sign of wisdom, not weakness.\n3.  **Address Husband Situation:** Continue making sincere dua, but also consider practical steps like communication, mediation, and seeking scholarly advice regarding your marital rights and options.\n4.  **Stick to Authenticity:** When it comes to Dhikr and Duas, rely on what is established in the Quran and Sunnah.\n\nYou are a strong woman who continues to turn to Allah every day, even in the depths of despair. This is a tremendous sign of your faith. Hold onto this connection, for Allah is *Ar-Rahman, Ar-Raheem* (The Most Merciful, The Especially Merciful), *Al-Wakeel* (The Disposer of Affairs), and *As-Saboor* (The Patient One). He sees your tears, hears your pleas, and is closer to you than your jugular vein.\n\nMay Allah grant you immediate relief from your panic, fill your life with peace and contentment, reunite you with your husband in goodness if it is best for your deen and dunya, and grant you a life of happiness and tranquility. Ameen."}
{"Question": "Q: This evening, I was in a shop about to pay for my shopping, when a woman, who seemed to be off her head, came into the shop and began talking away incoherently with the shopkeeper and myself. She seemed to be on drugs or drunk or something. She had some shopping gathered, and about to pay for it. Amongst her shopping, she had some beer cans (alcohol). As she was talking to me, she kept on touching the back of my left hand with her index finger every now and then, so as to get me to sort of agree with her on what she was going on about, and also as a way of making a point. It was harmless, but I felt uncomfortable. But just after she had paid for her stuff, one of her beer cans fell out of her bag on the ground, and I picked it up and gave it to her. That was it. I know one shouldnt deal with alcohol in any way, but I went ahead and picked the beer can up (knowing alcohol is haram) for her and handed it to her! Is there any sin on me due to this? And what is the ruling on this sort of thing, i.e helping someone pick up their beer cans/bottles after they had dropped it on the floor? What can I do to make up for this if anything? How about the woman tapping me on the back of my hand, as a way of emphasising her, incoherent points? What should I do in this case? ? --T--", "Answer": "1. You should make tawbah for picking up the beer can and giving it to her and refrain from this in the future. 2. Allowing her to touch you was incorrect and impermissible. You should have immediately stopped her from touching you. You should make istighfaar for what has happened. And Allah Taala ( ) knows best", "Document": "Ubadah b. Walid b. Samit reported:I and my father set out in search of knowledge to a tribe of the Ansar before their death (i. e. before the Companions of the Holy Prophet left the world) and I was the first to meet Abu Yasar, a Companion of Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) and there was a young man with him who carried the record of letters with him and there was a mantle prepared by the tribe of Maafiri upon him. And his servant too had a Maafiri mantle over him. My father said to him: My uncle, I see the signs of anger or that of agony on your face. He said: Yes, such and such person, the son of so and so, of the tribe of Harami owed me a debt. I went to his family, extended salutations and said: Where is he? They said: He is not here. Then came out to me his son who was at the threshold of his youth. I said to him: Where is your father? He said: No sooner did he hear your sound than he hid himself behind my mothers bedstead. I said to him: Walk out to me, for I know where you are. He came out. I said to him: What prompted you to hide yourself from me? He said: By God, whatever I would say to you would not be a lie. By Allah, I fear that I should tell a lie to you and in case of making promise with you I should break it, as you are the Companion of Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him). The fact is that I was hard up in regard to money. I said: Do you adjure by Allah? He said: I adjure by Allah. I said: Do you adjure by Allah? He said: I adjure by Allah. I said: Do you adjure by Allah? He said: I adjure by Allah. Then he brought his promissory note and he wrote off (the debt) with his hand and said: Make payment when you find yourself solvent enough to pay me back; if you are not, then there is no liability upon you. These two eyes of mine saw, and he (AbuI-Yasar) placed his fingers upon his eyes and these two ears of mine heard and my heart retained, and he pointed towards his heart that Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: He who gives time to one who is financially hard up (in the payment of debt) or writes off his debt, Allah will provide him His shadow. I said to him: My uncle, if you get the cloak of your servant and you give him your two clothes, or take his two clothes of Maafir and give him your cloak, then there would be one dress for you and one for him. He wiped my head and said: O Allah, bless the son of my brother. O, son of my brother, these two very eyes of mine saw and these two ears of mine listened to and this heart of mine retained this, and he pointed towards the heart that Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: Feed them (the servants) and clothe them (the servants) what you wear, and if I give him the goods of the world, it is easy for me than this that he should take my virtues on the Day of Resurrection. We went on till we came to Jabir b. Abdullah in the mosque and he was busy in observing prayer in one cloth which he had joined at its opposite ends. I made my way through the people till I sat between him and the Qibla and I said: May Allah have mercy upon you. Do you observe prayer with one cloth on your body whereas your mantle is lying at your side? He pointed me with his hand towards my breast just like this and he separated his fingers and bent them in the shape of a bow. And (he said): I thought that a fool like you should come to me so that he should see me as I do and he should then also do like it. Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) came to us in this very mosque and he had in his hand the twig of the palm-tree and he saw mucus towards the Qibla of the mosque and he erased it with the help of the twig. He then came to us and said: Who amongst you likes that Allah should turn His face away from him? We were afraid. He then again said: Who amongst you likes that Allah should turn His face away from him? We were afraid. He again said: Who amongst you likes that Allah should turn His face away from him? We said: Allahs Messenger, none of us likes it. And he said: If one amongst you stands for prayer, Allah, the Exalted and Glorious, is before him he should not spit in front of him, or on his right side, but should spit on his left side beneath his left foot and if he is impelled to do so all of a sudden (in spite of himself) he should then spit in his cloth and fold it in some part of it. (and he further said: ) Bring some sweet-smelling thing. A young man who belonged to our tribe stood up, went and brought scent in his palm. Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) took that and applied it to the end of that twig and then touched the place where there had been mucus. Jabir said: This is why you should apply scent to your mosques. It is reported on the same authority: We set out along with Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) on an expedition of Batn Buwat. He (the Holy Prophet) was in search of al-Majdi b. Amr al-Juhani. (We had so meagre equipment) that five. six or seven of us had one camel to ride and so we mounted it turn by turn. Once there wan. the turn of an Ansari to ride upon the camel. He made it kneel down to ride over it (and after having. mounted it), he tried to raise it up but it hesitated. So he said. May there be curse of Allah upon you! Thereupon Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: Who is there to curse his camel? He said: Allahs Messenger, it is I. Thereupon he said: Get down from the camel and let us not have in our company the cursed one. Dont curse your own selves, nor your children. nor your belongings. There is the possibility that your curse may synchronies with the time when Allah is about to confer upon you what you demand and thus your prayer may be readily responded. It is reported on the same authority: We set out on an expedition along with Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) until it was evening, and we had been near a. water reservoir of Arabia. Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: Who would be the person who would go ahead and set right the reservoir and drink water himself and serve us with it? Jabir said: I stood up and said: Allahs Messenger, it is I who am ready to do that. Thereupon Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: Who is the person to accompany Jabir? And then Jabbar b. Sakhr stood up. So we went to that well and poured in that tank a bucket or two of water and plastered it with clay and then began to fill it (with water) until it was filled to the brim. Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) was the first who appeared before us, and he said: Do you (both) permit me to drink water out of it? We said: Yea, Allahs Messenger. He led his camel to drink water and it drank. He then pulled its rein and it stretched its legs and began to urinate. He then took it aside and made it kneel down at another place and then came to the tank and performed ablution. I then got up and performed ablution like the ablution of Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him), and Jabbar b. Sakhr went in order to relieve himself and Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) got up to observe prayer and there was a mantle over me. I tried to invert its ends but it was too short (to cover my body easily). It had its borders. I then inverted it (the mantle) and drew its opposite ends and then tied them at my neck. I then came and stood upon the left side of Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him). He caught hold of me and made me go round behind him, until he made me stand on his right side. Then Jabbar b. Sakhr came. He performed ablution and then came and stood on the left side of Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him). Then Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) caught hold of our hands together, pushed us back and made us stand behind him. Then Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) began to look upon me with darting looks, but I did not perceive that. After that I became aware of it and he pointed with the gesture of his hand that I should wrap my loin-cloth. When Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) had finished the prayer, he said: Jabir! I said: Allahs Messenger, at thy beck and call. He said: When the cloth around you is inadequate, then tie the opposite ends but when it is small, tie it over the lower body. Jabir reported: We set out on an expedition with Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) and the only means of sustenance for every person amongst us was only one date for a day and we used to chew it. And we struck the leaves with the help of our bow and ate them until the sides of our mouths were injured. It so happened one day that a person was overlooked and not given a date. We carried that person and bore witness to the fact that he had not been given that date so he was offered that and he got up and received that. Jabir reported: We set out on an expedition along with Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) until we got down at a spacious valley and Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) went to relieve himself. I followed him with a bucket full of water and Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) looked about and he found no privacy but two trees at the end of the valley and Allahs Messenger (may. peace be upon him) went to one of them and took hold of one of its twigs and said: Be thou under my control by the permission of Allah, and so it came under his control like the camel who has its nosestring in the hand of its rider, and then he came to the second tree and took hold of a twig and said: Be thou under my control with the permission of Allah, and it came under his control, and when he came in the middle of the two trees he joined together the two twigs and said: join with the permission of Allah. Jabir said: I was afraid lest Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) should be aware of my nearness and go still farther. And Muhammad b. Abbad has used the word\" faitabd\" and I began to talk to myself. And as I saw, I suddenly found Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) before me and the two trees were separated and each one of them was standing at its place. I saw Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) standing for a short time, nodding his head towards right and left. Ismail pointed towards the right and left with the help of his head (in order to demonstrate how the Holy Prophet had pointed). Then he (the Holy Prophet) came to me and said: Jabir did you see my place where I was standing? I said: Allahs Messenger, yes. He then said: Then you should go to those two trees and cut a twig from each of them and go to that place with them where I was standing and stand there where I was standing and place a twig on the right and a twig on the left. Jabir said: I set out and took hold of a stone and broke it and sharpened it and then I came to those trees and cut a twig from each one of them. I then came dragging them until I stood at the place where Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) had been standing and placed a twig on the right and a twig on the left. Then I met him and said: Allahs Messenger, I have done that, but (kindly) explain to me the reason for it. Thereupon he said: I passed by two graves the occupants of which had been undergoing torment. I liked to make intercession for them so that the might be relieved of this torment y as long as these twigs remain fresh. Jabir said: We came back to the (camp of the) army and Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: Jabir, call people for per- forming wudu. I cried: Come and perform wudu, come and perform wudu, come and perform wudu. I said: Allahs Messenger, there is not even a drop of water in the army camp, and there. was a person who used to cool the water for Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) in the old water-skin which kept hanging by the twig. He asked me to go to such and such Ansari and ask him to see if there was any water in that skin. I went to him and cast a glance in it but did not find anything but a drop in the mouth of that water-skin and if I were to draw that, the water-skins,. dried part would suck it up. I came to Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) and said: Allahs Messenger, I have not found anything in it but a drop of water in the mouth of the water-skin and now if I were to draw that, it would be absorbed. He said: Go and bring that to me. I brought that to him. He took hold of it -and began to utter something which I could not understand and then pressed it with his hand and gave that to me and said: Jabir, announce for the tub to be brought. So I announced that the tub of the army (be brought). It was brought accordingly and I placed it before him (the Holy Prophet). Thereupon Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) placed his hands in the tub like this: with his fingers stretched out, and then he placed his fingers at the bottom of the tub and said: Jabir, take it (that waters-skin) and pour water over me, by reciting Bismillah, and I poured water and I said: Bismillah, and found water sprouting out between the fingers of Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him). Then that tub gushed forth until it was filled up and the Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: Jabir, make an announcement to the effect: He who needs water should take that. Jabir said: The people came and got water until they were all satiated. I said: Is there anyone left who wants to get it? And Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) then lifted up his hand from that tub and it was still full. Then the people made a complaint to Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) about hunger and he said: May Allah provide you food! We came to the bank of the ocean and the ocean was tossing and it threw out a big animal and we lit fire and cooked it and took it until we had eaten to our hearts content. Jabir said: I and such and such five persons entered Its socket and nobody could see us until we had come out, and we took hold of one of its ribs and twisted it into a sort of arch, then we called the tallest of the persons of the army and the hugest of the camels of the army and it had the big saddle over it, and it could easily pass through it without the rider having need to bend down.<D>Musab b. Sad reported on the authority of his father that many verses of the Quran had been revealed in connection with him. His mother Umm Sad had taken oath that she would never talk with him until he abandoned his faith and she neither ate nor drank and said:Allah has commanded you to treat well your parents and I am your mother and I command you to do this. She passed three days in this state until she fainted because of extreme hunger and at that time her son whose name was Umara stood up and served her drink and she began to curse Sad that Allah, the Exalted and Glorions, revealed these verses of the Holy Quran:\" And We have enjoined upon a person goodness to his parents but if they contend with thee to associate (others) with Me of which you have no knowledge, then obey them not\" (xxix. 8) ; Treat thein with customary good in this world\" (xxxi. 15). He also reported that there fell to the lot of Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) huge spoils of war and there was one sword in them. I picked that up and came to Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) and said: Bestow this sword upon me (as my share in the spoils of war) and you know my state. Thereupon he said: Return it to the place from where you picked it up. I went back until I decided to throw it in a store but my soul repulsed me so I came back and asked him to give that sword to me. He said in a loud voice to return it to the place from where I had picked it up. It was on this occasion that this verse was revealed:\" They asked about the spoils of war\" (viii. 1). He further said: I once fell ill and sent a message to Allahs Apostle (may peace be upon him). He visited me and I said to him: Permit me to distribute (in charity) my property as much as I like. He did not agree. I said: (Permit me to distribute) half of it. He did not agree. I said: (Permit me to distribute) the third part, whereupon he kept quiet and it was after this (that the distribution of ones property in charity) to the extent of one-third was held valid. He further said: I came to a group of persons of the Ansir and Muhajirin and they said: Come, so that we may serve you wine, and it was before the use of wine had been prohibited. I went to them in a garden and there had been with them the roasted head of a camel and a small water-skin containing wine. I ate and drank along with them and there came under discussion the Ansr (Helpers) and Muhajirin (immigrants). I said: The immigrants are better than the Ansar, that a person picked up a portion of the head (of the camel and struck me with it that my nose was injured. I came to Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) and informed him of the situation that Aliah, the Exalted and Glorious, revealed verses pertaining to wine:\" Intoxicants and the games of chance and (sacrificing to) stones set up and (divining by) arrows are only an uncleanliness, the devils work\" (v. 90).<D>Narrated Ibn `Abbas:The first lady to use a girdle was the mother of Ishmael. She used a girdle so that she might hide her tracks from Sarah. Abraham brought her and her son Ishmael while she was suckling him, to a place near the Ka`ba under a tree on the spot of Zamzam, at the highest place in the mosque. During those days there was nobody in Mecca, nor was there any water So he made them sit over there and placed near them a leather bag containing some dates, and a small water-skin containing some water, and set out homeward. Ishmaels mother followed him saying, \"O Abraham! Where are you going, leaving us in this valley where there is no person whose company we may enjoy, nor is there anything (to enjoy)?\" She repeated that to him many times, but he did not look back at her Then she asked him, \"Has Allah ordered you to do so?\" He said, \"Yes.\" She said, \"Then He will not neglect us,\" and returned while Abraham proceeded onwards, and on reaching the Thaniya where they could not see him, he faced the Ka`ba, and raising both hands, invoked Allah saying the following prayers: O our Lord! I have made some of my offspring dwell in a valley without cultivation, by Your Sacred House (Ka`ba at Mecca) in order, O our Lord, that they may offer prayer perfectly. So fill some hearts among men with love towards them, and (O Allah) provide them with fruits, so that they may give thanks. (14.37) Ishmaels mother went on suckling Ishmael and drinking from the water (she had). When the water in the water-skin had all been used up, she became thirsty and her child also became thirsty. She started looking at him (i.e. Ishmael) tossing in agony; She left him, for she could not endure looking at him, and found that the mountain of Safa was the nearest mountain to her on that land. She stood on it and started looking at the valley keenly so that she might see somebody, but she could not see anybody. Then she descended from Safa and when she reached the valley, she tucked up her robe and ran in the valley like a person in distress and trouble, till she crossed the valley and reached the Marwa mountain where she stood and started looking, expecting to see somebody, but she could not see anybody. She repeated that (running between Safa and Marwa) seven times.\" The Prophet said, \"This is the source of the tradition of the walking of people between them (i.e. Safa and Marwa). When she reached the Marwa (for the last time) she heard a voice and she asked herself to be quiet and listened attentively. She heard the voice again and said, O, (whoever you may be)! You have made me hear your voice; have you got something to help me?\" And behold! She saw an angel at the place of Zamzam, digging the earth with his heel (or his wing), till water flowed from that place. She started to make something like a basin around it, using her hand in this way, and started filling her water-skin with water with her hands, and the water was flowing out after she had scooped some of it.\" The Prophet added, \"May Allah bestow Mercy on Ishmaels mother! Had she let the Zamzam (flow without trying to control it) (or had she not scooped from that water) (to fill her water-skin), Zamzam would have been a stream flowing on the surface of the earth.\" The Prophet further added, \"Then she drank (water) and suckled her child. The angel said to her, Dont be afraid of being neglected, for this is the House of Allah which will be built by this boy and his father, and Allah never neglects His people. The House (i.e. Ka`ba) at that time was on a high place resembling a hillock, and when torrents came, they flowed to its right and left. She lived in that way till some people from the tribe of Jurhum or a family from Jurhum passed by her and her child, as they (i.e. the Jurhum people) were coming through the way of Kada. They landed in the lower part of Mecca where they saw a bird that had the habit of flying around water and not leaving it. They said, This bird must be flying around water, though we know that there is no water in this valley. They sent one or two messengers who discovered the source of water, and returned to inform them of the water. So, they all came (towards the water).\" The Prophet added, \"Ishmaels mother was sitting near the water. They asked her, Do you allow us to stay with you?\" She replied, Yes, but you will have no right to possess the water. They agreed to that.\" The Prophet further said, \"Ishmaels mother was pleased with the whole situation as she used to love to enjoy the company of the people. So, they settled there, and later on they sent for their families who came and settled with them so that some families became permanent residents there. The child (i.e. Ishmael) grew up and learnt Arabic from them and (his virtues) caused them to love and admire him as he grew up, and when he reached the age of puberty they made him marry a woman from amongst them. After Ishmaels mother had died, Abraham came after Ishmaels marriage in order to see his family that he had left before, but he did not find Ishmael there. When he asked Ishmaels wife about him, she replied, He has gone in search of our livelihood. Then he asked her about their way of living and their condition, and she replied, We are living in misery; we are living in hardship and destitution, complaining to him. He said, When your husband returns, convey my salutation to him and tell him to change the threshold of the gate (of his house). When Ishmael came, he seemed to have felt something unusual, so he asked his wife, Has anyone visited you? She replied, Yes, an old man of so-and-so description came and asked me about you and I informed him, and he asked about our state of living, and I told him that we were living in a hardship and poverty. On that Ishmael said, Did he advise you anything? She replied, Yes, he told me to convey his salutation to you and to tell you to change the threshold of your gate. Ishmael said, It was my father, and he has ordered me to divorce you. Go back to your family. So, Ishmael divorced her and married another woman from amongst them (i.e. Jurhum). Then Abraham stayed away from them for a period as long as Allah wished and called on them again but did not find Ishmael. So he came to Ishmaels wife and asked her about Ishmael. She said, He has gone in search of our livelihood. Abraham asked her, How are you getting on? asking her about their sustenance and living. She replied, We are prosperous and well-off (i.e. we have everything in abundance). Then she thanked Allah Abraham said, What kind of food do you eat? She said. Meat. He said, What do you drink? She said, Water.\" He said, \"O Allah! Bless their meat and water.\" The Prophet added, \"At that time they did not have grain, and if they had grain, he would have also invoked Allah to bless it.\" The Prophet added, \"If somebody has only these two things as his sustenance, his health and disposition will be badly affected, unless he lives in Mecca.\" The Prophet added,\" Then Abraham said Ishmaels wife, \"When your husband comes, give my regards to him and tell him that he should keep firm the threshold of his gate. When Ishmael came back, he asked his wife, Did anyone call on you? She replied, Yes, a good-looking old man came to me, so she praised him and added. He asked about you, and I informed him, and he asked about our livelihood and I told him that we were in a good condition. Ishmael asked her, Did he give you any piece of advice? She said, Yes, he told me to give his regards to you and ordered that you should keep firm the threshold of your gate. On that Ishmael said, It was my father, and you are the threshold (of the gate). He has ordered me to keep you with me. Then Abraham stayed away from them for a period as long as Allah wished, and called on them afterwards. He saw Ishmael under a tree near Zamzam, sharpening his arrows. When he saw Abraham, he rose up to welcome him (and they greeted each other as a father does with his son or a son does with his father). Abraham said, O Ishmael! Allah has given me an order. Ishmael said, Do what your Lord has ordered you to do. Abraham asked, Will you help me? Ishmael said, I will help you. Abraham said, Allah has ordered me to build a house here, pointing to a hillock higher than the land surrounding it.\" The Prophet added, \"Then they raised the foundations of the House (i.e. the Ka`ba). Ishmael brought the stones and Abraham was building, and when the walls became high, Ishmael brought this stone and put it for Abraham who stood over it and carried on building, while Ishmael was handing him the stones, and both of them were saying, O our Lord! Accept (this service) from us, Verily, You are the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing. The Prophet added, \"Then both of them went on building and going round the Ka`ba saying: O our Lord ! Accept (this service) from us, Verily, You are the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing.\" (2.127)<D>Allah then said to them after He brought them back to life: (And fight in the way of Allah) in obedience of Allah against your enemies, (and know that Allah is Hearer) of what you say, (Knower) of your intentions and the punishment that is going to visit you if you disobey what you have been commanded to do.<D>(Say: O People of the Scripture! Why drive ye back believers) in Allah, Muhammad and the Quran (from the way of Allah) from the Religion of Allah and His worship, (seeking to make it crooked, when you are witnesses?) when you know it to be in the Scripture. (Allah is not unaware of what ye do) Allah is not oblivious to your disbelief: concealing the Truth and committing transgressions. This verse was revealed about those who invited Ammar [Ibn Yasir] and his fellow Muslims to join their religion: Judaism.<D>Allah then mentions His covenant with the Children of Israel, saying: (And when We made a covenant with the Children of Israel: Worship none save Allah) declare Him as the only true God and do not ascribe any partner to Him, (and be good to parents) be dutiful to them (and to kindred) and keep contact with relatives (and to orphans) and be kind to orphans (and the needy) and generous to the needy, (and speak kindly to mankind) say the Truth regarding Muhammad (pbuh); (and establish prayer) perfect the five daily prayers (and pay the poor-due) and give from your wealth what is due to the poor. (Then, after that, ye slid back) you turned back on this covenant, (save a few of you) from amongst your forefathers; as it is said that this refers to Abdullah Ibn Salam and his companions, (being averse) denying and leaving it aside. ", "Generated_Answer": "This was certainly an awkward and uncomfortable situation for you, and your concern shows your strong conscience and desire to remain pure in your dealings, which is commendable. Let's break down each part of your question:\n\n**1. Picking Up the Beer Can:**\n\n*   **General Islamic Principle:** Indeed, Islam strictly prohibits alcohol (khamr) in all its forms, and this prohibition extends to any form of assistance in its production, sale, consumption, or even transport. The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) cursed ten categories of people associated with wine: the one who presses it, the one for whom it is pressed, the one who drinks it, the one who carries it, the one for whom it is carried, the one who serves it, the one who sells it, the one who consumes its price, the one who buys it, and the one for whom it is bought. (Tirmidhi, Ibn Majah)\n*   **Your Specific Action:** In your case, picking up a dropped beer can and handing it back was an act of spontaneous politeness in an unexpected and uncomfortable situation. It wasn't an act of buying, selling, or directly facilitating the *consumption* of alcohol in a primary way. The woman had already purchased it, and the item was merely dropped. Your action was akin to returning a dropped wallet or a grocery item, albeit the item was haram.\n*   **Is there sin on you?** While it's always best to avoid any interaction with haram items, the scholars generally differentiate between *direct* facilitation of a sin (like selling or serving alcohol) and *incidental* or *unintended* involvement. In your situation, your intention was not to promote or aid in the sin of drinking alcohol, but rather a reflex action of returning a dropped item out of courtesy, in a moment of distress caused by the woman's behavior. Given the context (her state, the unexpectedness, the immediate reflex), it is **unlikely to be considered a major sin** on your part. It was more of an oversight or an action driven by social conditioning (helping someone pick up their dropped items) in a difficult moment.\n*   **Ruling on such a thing in the future:** In an ideal scenario, if you can avoid it without causing a scene or putting yourself in danger, you should. For instance, you could have just pointed it out to her, or subtly ignored it if it didn't create a further problem. However, in such a volatile situation with someone who seemed \"off their head,\" directly refusing or ignoring might have escalated things. So, while it's best to avoid, do not torment yourself over this particular instance.\n\n**2. Making Up for This:**\n\n*   Since it's unlikely to be a major sin, there's no specific ritual expiation (kaffarah) required. However, it's always good to:\n    *   **Seek Forgiveness (Tawbah):** Sincerely turn to Allah, express any regret you feel, and ask for His forgiveness for any shortcomings. Allah is Most Forgiving and Most Merciful.\n    *   **Increase Good Deeds:** \"Indeed, good deeds erase evil deeds.\" (Quran 11:114). Continue to strive in your prayers, charity, kindness to others, and avoidance of clear sins.\n    *   **Learn from it:** Be more mindful in similar situations in the future, if such a scenario arises again.\n\n**3. The Woman Tapping You on the Back of Your Hand:**\n\n*   **Islamic Ruling on Physical Contact:** In Islam, physical contact between non-mahram men and women (those whom one is permitted to marry, i.e., not close relatives like a mother, sister, daughter) is generally prohibited, unless there is a necessity (e.g., medical treatment, saving a life) or in the context of unavoidable public situations where it's accidental and without intent of lust/desire.\n*   **Your Specific Situation:**\n    *   **Her state:** She was \"off her head,\" possibly under the influence, and incoherent. Her actions were likely not driven by any inappropriate intent but by her impaired state and an attempt to communicate.\n    *   **Your feelings:** You felt \"uncomfortable\" and it was \"harmless.\" This indicates you did not invite or welcome the contact, nor did you derive any pleasure from it.\n    *   **Your responsibility:** You are not sinful for someone else touching you without your consent or encouragement, especially when that person is in an abnormal state. You maintained your discomfort, which is the correct internal reaction.\n*   **What to do in this case:**\n    *   **At the time:** The best course of action is to subtly create distance. Gently move your hand away, take a step back, or turn slightly to break the physical connection. You can also try to politely change the subject or disengage from the conversation if possible. Given her incoherent state, directly confronting her might have been difficult or ineffective.\n    *   **Afterwards:** There is no sin on you for her unwanted touching. You were in a difficult situation. Make dua for protection and ease in dealing with challenging social encounters.\n\nIn summary, you were in a challenging and uncomfortable situation. Your actions, while involving items that are haram, were largely spontaneous, driven by reflex politeness, and not intended to facilitate sin. There is likely no major sin on you for these actions. Focus on seeking Allah's forgiveness for any shortcomings, and continue striving to live by Islamic principles. Allah understands the difficulties and nuances of our daily lives."}

", "Generated_Answer": "No, a woman does *not* need to cover her hair compulsorily while doing wudhu.\n\nHere's a breakdown of why:\n\n1.  **Requirement for Wudhu:**\n    *   One of the obligatory acts (fara'id) of wudhu is to wipe a portion of the head (masah al-ra's). For this, you actually need to expose your hair to wipe it. It would be contradictory to say you must cover it and also wipe it.\n    *   The validity of wudhu depends on fulfilling its prescribed steps: washing the face, arms up to the elbows, wiping the head, and washing the feet up to the ankles. Covering the hair is not one of these steps, nor is exposing it an invalidator.\n\n2.  **Purpose of Hijab vs. Wudhu:**\n    *   The obligation to cover the hair (hijab) is related to modesty and is required when a woman is in the presence of non-mahram men (men she can potentially marry).\n    *   Wudhu is an act of ritual purification performed to prepare for prayer or other acts of worship. It can be performed anywhere, including in private spaces like a bathroom or a women-only prayer area. The rules of hijab do not apply in private or in the presence of only mahram relatives or other women.\n\n**Therefore:**\n\n*   **Should a woman while doing wudhu cover her hair compulsorily?** No. In fact, she *must* expose at least a portion of it to perform the wiping (masah) as part of wudhu.\n*   **If she does not cover will her wudhu be invalid?** Absolutely not. Her wudhu will remain valid, provided all its other necessary steps are performed correctly.\n\nThe rules of wudhu are distinct from the rules of dress code (hijab)."}

It's wonderful that you're seeking solutions to this common concern. Many sisters experience increased hair loss or breakage while wearing the hijab, and it's often due to a combination of factors, not necessarily \"doing something wrong\" in the sense of neglecting your religious duty.\n\nYou're absolutely right to consider the type of cloth! That's a significant factor, but there are also several other things to look at.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the best types of hijab fabrics and other crucial tips to reduce hair loss:\n\n---\n\n### 1. Hijab Fabric Choice (Addressing Your Direct Question)\n\nThe type of fabric plays a huge role in hair health, as some materials can cause more friction, trap heat and moisture, or simply not breathe well.\n\n**Best Fabrics to Reduce Hair Loss:**\n\n*   **Cotton:** This is often the top recommendation.\n    *   **Pros:** Highly breathable, soft, absorbent (manages sweat without trapping it against the scalp), causes less friction.\n    *   **Cons:** Can wrinkle easily, may feel heavy if it's a very thick weave.\n*   **Bamboo:** Gaining popularity for hair health.\n    *   **Pros:** Incredibly soft, naturally breathable, moisture-wicking, often hypoallergenic, and smooth texture reduces friction.\n    *   **Cons:** Can be more expensive.\n*   **Modal:** A type of rayon made from spun beechwood cellulose.\n    *   **Pros:** Very soft, smooth, drapes well, and breathable. It's often compared to silk in terms of feel but is more absorbent.\n    *   **Cons:** Can be less durable than cotton if not cared for properly.\n*   **Jersey (High-Quality, Breathable Blend):**\n    *   **Pros:** Soft, comfortable, great drape, generally less prone to slipping. Look for blends with cotton or bamboo for breathability.\n    *   **Cons:** Lower quality jersey (especially those high in synthetic fibers like polyester) can be less breathable and trap heat.\n*   **Chiffon (with a Breathable Undercap):**\n    *   **Pros:** Lightweight, elegant, airy.\n    *   **Cons:** While the chiffon itself is light, it doesn't offer much in terms of breathability for the hair underneath. *Crucially, if you wear chiffon, always pair it with a very breathable cotton or bamboo undercap.* The undercap is what will protect your hair.\n\n**Fabrics to Minimize or Avoid (Especially Directly Against Hair):**\n\n*   **Polyester/Synthetic Blends (especially cheap ones):**\n    *   **Why:** They don't breathe well, trap heat and moisture (creating a damp, warm environment ripe for bacterial/fungal growth, and weakening hair follicles), and can create more static and friction.\n*   **Heavy, Rough, or Stiff Fabrics:**\n    *   **Why:** Increase friction against the hairline and hair strands, leading to breakage.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Hair Care Routine & Practices Under the Hijab\n\nEven with the right fabric, how you care for your hair and wear your hijab makes a significant difference.\n\n*   **Ensure Hair is 100% Dry:** This is perhaps the *most critical* tip. NEVER wear your hijab over damp or wet hair.\n    *   **Why:** Trapping moisture creates a breeding ground for fungus, bacteria, and yeast (which can lead to scalp issues like dandruff, itchiness, and inflammation that contribute to hair loss). Damp hair is also much weaker and more prone to breakage when rubbed or pulled.\n    *   **How:** Air dry as much as possible. If using a blow dryer, use a cool setting and ensure it's completely dry before covering.\n*   **Avoid Tight Hair Styles:**\n    *   **Why:** Constant tension on the hair follicles (traction alopecia) can lead to permanent hair loss, especially around the hairline and temples.\n    *   **How:** Opt for loose braids, a low and loose ponytail, or simply gathering your hair gently without a tie underneath. Avoid high, tight buns directly under the hijab.\n*   **Use Hair-Friendly Ties and Scrunchies:**\n    *   **Why:** Regular elastic bands can snag and break hair.\n    *   **How:** Use silk or satin scrunchies, soft fabric ties, or spiral hair ties (like Invisibobbles) which reduce friction and pulling.\n*   **Wash Your Hair Regularly & Maintain Scalp Health:**\n    *   **Why:** Sweat, oils, and product buildup can clog follicles and weaken hair.\n    *   **How:** Wash your hair as often as needed to keep your scalp clean (this varies per person). Use a gentle, sulfate-free shampoo and focus on cleansing the scalp. Consider a scalp massage brush to stimulate circulation.\n*   **Let Your Hair Breathe at Home:**\n    *   **Why:** Your scalp and hair need exposure to air to prevent excessive moisture buildup and allow follicles to function optimally.\n    *   **How:** As soon as you're in a private space, take off your hijab and untie your hair. Let it down and air out. Don't immediately re-tie it tightly.\n*   **Use a Breathable Undercap/Bonnet:**\n    *   **Why:** Even if your outer hijab is cotton, a non-breathable undercap can defeat the purpose. It's the first layer against your hair.\n    *   **How:** Choose undercaps made of cotton, bamboo, or modal. Ensure it's not too tight or constricting around your hairline. Wash your undercaps frequently, as they absorb sweat and oils.\n\n---\n\n### 3. General Hair Health & Lifestyle Factors\n\nHair loss can also be influenced by factors beyond the hijab.\n\n*   **Nutrition:**\n    *   **Why:** Hair health is a direct reflection of your overall health. Deficiencies can lead to hair shedding.\n    *   **How:** Ensure your diet is rich in protein, iron (especially important for women), zinc, and vitamins (especially B vitamins, Vitamin D, Vitamin C, and E). Foods like lean meats, eggs, leafy greens, nuts, seeds, and fruits are vital.\n*   **Hydration:** Drink plenty of water.\n*   **Stress Management:** High stress levels can lead to a type of hair loss called telogen effluvium.\n*   **Medical Check-Up:** If the hair loss is significant or sudden, or if you notice other symptoms (fatigue, weight changes, etc.), please consult a doctor.\n    *   **Why:** Underlying conditions like thyroid issues, iron deficiency (anemia), hormonal imbalances (like PCOS), or certain medications can cause hair loss. A doctor can rule these out or provide appropriate treatment.\n\n---\n\nBy combining breathable hijab fabrics with mindful hair care practices and addressing overall health, you can significantly reduce hair loss and maintain healthy, beautiful hair while proudly wearing your hijab! May Allah bless you for your efforts."}

Abraham brought her and her son Ishmael while she was suckling him, to a place near the Ka`ba under a tree on the spot of Zamzam, at the highest place in the mosque. During those days there was nobody in Mecca, nor was there any water So he made them sit over there and placed near them a leather bag containing some dates, and a small water-skin containing some water, and set out homeward. Ishmaels mother followed him saying, \"O Abraham! Where are you going, leaving us in this valley where there is no person whose company we may enjoy, nor is there anything (to enjoy)?\" She repeated that to him many times, but he did not look back at her Then she asked him, \"Has Allah ordered you to do so?\" He said, \"Yes.\" She said, \"Then He will not neglect us,\" and returned while Abraham proceeded onwards, and on reaching the Thaniya where they could not see him, he faced the Ka`ba, and raising both hands, invoked Allah saying the following prayers: O our Lord! I have made some of my offspring dwell in a valley without cultivation, by Your Sacred House (Ka`ba at Mecca) in order, O our Lord, that they may offer prayer perfectly. So fill some hearts among men with love towards them, and (O Allah) provide them with fruits, so that they may give thanks. (14.37) Ishmaels mother went on suckling Ishmael and drinking from the water (she had). When the water in the water-skin had all been used up, she became thirsty and her child also became thirsty. She started looking at him (i.e. Ishmael) tossing in agony; She left him, for she could not endure looking at him, and found that the mountain of Safa was the nearest mountain to her on that land. She stood on it and started looking at the valley keenly so that she might see somebody, but she could not see anybody. Then she descended from Safa and when she reached the valley, she tucked up her robe and ran in the valley like a person in distress and trouble, till she crossed the valley and reached the Marwa mountain where she stood and started looking, expecting to see somebody, but she could not see anybody. She repeated that (running between Safa and Marwa) seven times.\" The Prophet said, \"This is the source of the tradition of the walking of people between them (i.e. Safa and Marwa). When she reached the Marwa (for the last time) she heard a voice and she asked herself to be quiet and listened attentively. She heard the voice again and said, O, (whoever you may be)! You have made me hear your voice; have you got something to help me?\" And behold! She saw an angel at the place of Zamzam, digging the earth with his heel (or his wing), till water flowed from that place. She started to make something like a basin around it, using her hand in this way, and started filling her water-skin with water with her hands, and the water was flowing out after she had scooped some of it.\" The Prophet added, \"May Allah bestow Mercy on Ishmaels mother! Had she let the Zamzam (flow without trying to control it) (or had she not scooped from that water) (to fill her water-skin), Zamzam would have been a stream flowing on the surface of the earth.\" The Prophet further added, \"Then she drank (water) and suckled her child. The angel said to her, Dont be afraid of being neglected, for this is the House of Allah which will be built by this boy and his father, and Allah never neglects His people. The House (i.e. Ka`ba) at that time was on a high place resembling a hillock, and when torrents came, they flowed to its right and left. She lived in that way till some people from the tribe of Jurhum or a family from Jurhum passed by her and her child, as they (i.e. the Jurhum people) were coming through the way of Kada. They landed in the lower part of Mecca where they saw a bird that had the habit of flying around water and not leaving it. They said, This bird must be flying around water, though we know that there is no water in this valley. They sent one or two messengers who discovered the source of water, and returned to inform them of the water. So, they all came (towards the water).\" The Prophet added, \"Ishmaels mother was sitting near the water. They asked her, Do you allow us to stay with you?\" She replied, Yes, but you will have no right to possess the water. They agreed to that.\" The Prophet further said, \"Ishmaels mother was pleased with the whole situation as she used to love to enjoy the company of the people. So, they settled there, and later on they sent for their families who came and settled with them so that some families became permanent residents there. The child (i.e. Ishmael) grew up and learnt Arabic from them and (his virtues) caused them to love and admire him as he grew up, and when he reached the age of puberty they made him marry a woman from amongst them. After Ishmaels mother had died, Abraham came after Ishmaels marriage in order to see his family that he had left before, but he did not find Ishmael there. When he asked Ishmaels wife about him, she replied, He has gone in search of our livelihood. Then he asked her about their way of living and their condition, and she replied, We are living in misery; we are living in hardship and destitution, complaining to him. He said, When your husband returns, convey my salutation to him and tell him to change the threshold of the gate (of his house). When Ishmael came, he seemed to have felt something unusual, so he asked his wife, Has anyone visited you? She replied, Yes, an old man of so-and-so description came and asked me about you and I informed him, and he asked about our state of living, and I told him that we were living in a hardship and poverty. On that Ishmael said, Did he advise you anything? She replied, Yes, he told me to convey his salutation to you and to tell you to change the threshold of your gate. Ishmael said, It was my father, and he has ordered me to divorce you. Go back to your family. So, Ishmael divorced her and married another woman from amongst them (i.e. Jurhum). Then Abraham stayed away from them for a period as long as Allah wished and called on them again but did not find Ishmael. So he came to Ishmaels wife and asked her about Ishmael. She said, He has gone in search of our livelihood. Abraham asked her, How are you getting on? asking her about their sustenance and living. She replied, We are prosperous and well-off (i.e. we have everything in abundance). Then she thanked Allah Abraham said, What kind of food do you eat? She said. Meat. He said, What do you drink? She said, Water.\" He said, \"O Allah! Bless their meat and water.\" The Prophet added, \"At that time they did not have grain, and if they had grain, he would have also invoked Allah to bless it.\" The Prophet added, \"If somebody has only these two things as his sustenance, his health and disposition will be badly affected, unless he lives in Mecca.\" The Prophet added,\" Then Abraham said Ishmaels wife, \"When your husband comes, give my regards to him and tell him that he should keep firm the threshold of his gate. When Ishmael came back, he asked his wife, Did anyone call on you? She replied, Yes, a good-looking old man came to me, so she praised him and added. He asked about you, and I informed him, and he asked about our livelihood and I told him that we were in a good condition. Ishmael asked her, Did he give you any piece of advice? She said, Yes, he told me to give his regards to you and ordered that you should keep firm the threshold of your gate. On that Ishmael said, It was my father, and you are the threshold (of the gate). He has ordered me to keep you with me. Then Abraham stayed away from them for a period as long as Allah wished, and called on them afterwards. He saw Ishmael under a tree near Zamzam, sharpening his arrows. When he saw Abraham, he rose up to welcome him (and they greeted each other as a father does with his son or a son does with his father). Abraham said, O Ishmael! Allah has given me an order. Ishmael said, Do what your Lord has ordered you to do. Abraham asked, Will you help me? Ishmael said, I will help you. Abraham said, Allah has ordered me to build a house here, pointing to a hillock higher than the land surrounding it.\" The Prophet added, \"Then they raised the foundations of the House (i.e. the Ka`ba). Ishmael brought the stones and Abraham was building, and when the walls became high, Ishmael brought this stone and put it for Abraham who stood over it and carried on building, while Ishmael was handing him the stones, and both of them were saying, O our Lord! Accept (this service) from us, Verily, You are the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing. The Prophet added, \"Then both of them went on building and going round the Ka`ba saying: O our Lord ! Accept (this service) from us, Verily, You are the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing.\" (2.127)<D>Narrated Aisha:(The wife of the Prophet) Whenever Allahs Apostle intended to go on a journey, he used to draw lots among his wives and would take with him the one on whom the lot had fallen. Once he drew lots when he wanted to carry out a Ghazwa, and the lot came upon me. So I proceeded with Allahs Apostle after Allahs order of veiling (the women) had been revealed and thus I was carried in my howdah (on a camel) and dismounted while still in it. We carried on our journey, and when Allahs Apostle had finished his Ghazwa and returned and we approached Medina, Allahs Apostle ordered to proceed at night. When the army was ordered to resume the homeward journey, I got up and walked on till I left the army (camp) behind. When I had answered the call of nature, I went towards my howdah, but behold ! A necklace of mine made of Jaz Azfar (a kind of black bead) was broken and I looked for it and my search for it detained me. The group of people who used to carry me, came and carried my howdah on to the back of my camel on which I was riding, considering that I was therein. At that time women were light in weight and were not fleshy for they used to eat little (food), so those people did not feel the lightness of the howdah while raising it up, and I was still a young lady. They drove away the camel and proceeded. Then I found my necklace after the army had gone. I came to their camp but found nobody therein so I went to the place where I used to stay, thinking that they would miss me and come back in my search. While I was sitting at my place, I felt sleepy and slept. Safwan bin Al-Muattil As-Sulami Adh- Dhakw-ani was behind the army. He had started in the last part of the night and reached my stationing place in the morning and saw the figure of a sleeping person. He came to me and recognized me on seeing me for he used to see me before veiling. I got up because of his saying: \"Inna Li l-lahi wa inna ilaihi rajiun,\" which he uttered on recognizing me. I covered my face with my garment, and by Allah, he did not say to me a single word except, \"Inna Li l-lahi wa inna ilaihi rajiun,\" till he made his shecamel kneel down whereupon he trod on its forelegs and I mounted it. Then Safwan set out, leading the she-camel that was carrying me, till we met the army while they were resting during the hot midday. Then whoever was meant for destruction, fell in destruction, and the leader of the Ifk (forged statement) was `Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul. After this we arrived at Medina and I became ill for one month while the people were spreading the forged statements of the people of the Ifk, and I was not aware of anything thereof. But what aroused my doubt while I was sick, was that I was no longer receiving from Allahs Apostle the same kindness as I used to receive when I fell sick. Allahs Apostle would enter upon me, say a greeting and add, \"How is that (lady)?\" and then depart. That aroused my suspicion but I was not aware of the propagated evil till I recovered from my ailment. I went out with Um Mistah to answer the call of nature towards Al-Manasi, the place where we used to relieve ourselves, and used not to go out for this purpose except from night to night, and that was before we had lavatories close to our houses. And this habit of ours was similar to the habit of the old Arabs (in the deserts or in the tents) concerning the evacuation of the bowels, for we considered it troublesome and harmful to take lavatories in the houses. So I went out with Um Mistah who was the daughter of Abi Ruhm bin `Abd Manaf, and her mother was daughter of Sakhr bin Amir who was the aunt of Abi Bakr As-Siddiq, and her son was Mistah bin Uthatha. When we had finished our affair, Um Mistah and I came back towards my house. Um Mistah stumbled over her robe whereupon she said, \"Let Mistah be ruined ! \" I said to her, \"What a bad word you have said! Do you abuse a man who has taken part in the Battle of Badr? She said, \"O you there! Didnt you hear what he has said?\" I said, \"And what did he say?\" She then told me the statement of the people of the Ifk (forged statement) which added to my ailment. When I returned home, Allahs Apostle came to me, and after greeting, he said, \"How is that (lady)?\" I said, \"Will you allow me to go to my parents?\" At that time I intended to be sure of the news through them. Allahs Apostle allowed me and I went to my parents and asked my mother, \"O my mother! What are the people talking about?\" My mother said, \"O my daughter! Take it easy, for by Allah, there is no charming lady who is loved by her husband who has other wives as well, but that those wives would find fault with her.\" I said, \"Subhan Allah! Did the people really talk about that?\" That night I kept on weeping the whole night till the morning. My tears never stopped, nor did I sleep, and morning broke while I was still weeping, Allahs Apostle called `Ali bin Abi Talib and Usama bin Zaid when the Divine Inspiration delayed, in order to consult them as to the idea of divorcing his wife. Usama bin Zaid told Allahs Apostle of what he knew about the innocence of his wife and of his affection he kept for her. He said, \"O Allahs Apostle! She is your wife, and we do not know anything about her except good.\" But `Ali bin Abi Talib said, \"O Allahs Apostle! Allah does not impose restrictions on you; and there are plenty of women other than her. If you however, ask (her) slave girl, she will tell you the truth.\" `Aisha added: So Allahs Apostle called for Barira and said, \"O Barira! Did you ever see anything which might have aroused your suspicion? (as regards Aisha). Barira said, \"By Allah Who has sent you with the truth, I have never seen anything regarding Aisha which I would blame her for except that she is a girl of immature age who sometimes sleeps and leaves the dough of her family unprotected so that the domestic goats come and eat it.\" So Allahs Apostle got up (and addressed) the people an asked for somebody who would take revenge on `Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul then. Allahs Apostle, while on the pulpit, said, \"O Muslims! Who will help me against a man who has hurt me by slandering my family? By Allah, I know nothing except good about my family, and people have blamed a man of whom I know nothing except good, and he never used to visit my family except with me,\" Sa`d bin Mu`adh Al-Ansari got up and said, \"O Allahs Apostle! By Allah, I will relieve you from him. If he be from the tribe of (Bani) Al-Aus, then I will chop his head off; and if he be from our brethren, the Khazraj, then you give us your order and we will obey it.\" On that, Sa`d bin Ubada got up, and he was the chief of the Khazraj, and before this incident he had been a pious man but he was incited by his zeal for his tribe. He said to Sa`d (bin Mu`adh), \"By Allah the Eternal, you have told a lie! You shall not kill him and you will never be able to kill him!\" On that, Usaid bin Hudair, the cousin of Sa`d (bin Mu`adh) got up and said to Sa`d bin Ubada, \"You are a liar! By Allah the Eternal, we will surely kill him; and you are a hypocrite defending the hypocrites!\" So the two tribes of Al-Aus and Al-Khazraj got excited till they were on the point of fighting with each other while Allahs Apostle was standing on the pulpit. Allahs Apostle continued quietening them till they became silent whereupon he became silent too. On that day I kept on weeping so much that neither did my tears stop, nor could I sleep. In the morning my parents were with me, and I had wept for two nights and a day without sleeping and with incessant tears till they thought that my liver would burst with weeping. While they were with me and I was weeping, an Ansari woman asked permission to see me. I admitted her and she sat and started weeping with me. While I was in that state, Allahs Apostle came to us, greeted, and sat down,. He had never sat with me since the day what was said, was said. He had stayed a month without receiving any Divine Inspiration concerning my case. Allahs Apostle recited the Tashahhud after he had sat down, and then said, \"Thereafter, O `Aisha! I have been informed such and-such a thing about you; and if you are innocent, Allah will reveal your innocence, and if you have committed a sin, then ask for Allahs forgiveness and repent to Him, for when a slave confesses his sin and then repents to Allah, Allah accepts his repentance.\" When Allahs Apostle had finished his speech, my tears ceased completely so that I no longer felt even a drop thereof. Then I said to my father, \"Reply to Allahs Apostle on my behalf as to what he said.\" He said, \"By Allah, I do not know what to say to Allahs Apostle.\" Then I said to my mother, \"Reply to Allahs Apostle.\" She said, \"I do not know what to say to Allahs Apostle.\" Still a young girl as I was and though I had little knowledge of Quran, I said, \"By Allah, I know that you heard this story (of the Ifk) so much so that it has been planted in your minds and you have believed it. So now, if I tell you that I am innocent, and Allah knows that I am innocent, you will not believe me; and if I confess something, and Allah knows that I am innocent of it, you will believe me. By Allah, I cannot find of you an example except that of Josephs father: \"So (for me) patience is most fitting against that which you assert and it is Allah (Alone) Whose help can be sought. Then I turned away and lay on my bed, and at that time I knew that I was innocent and that Allah would reveal my innocence. But by Allah, I never thought that Allah would sent down about my affair, Divine Inspiration that would be recited (forever), as I considered myself too unworthy to be talked of by Allah with something that was to be recited: but I hoped that Allahs Apostle might have a vision in which Allah would prove my innocence. By Allah, Allahs Apostle had not left his seat and nobody had left the house when the Divine Inspiration came to Allahs Apostle . So there overtook him the same hard condition which used to overtake him (when he was Divinely Inspired) so that the drops of his sweat were running down, like pearls, though it was a (cold) winter day, and that was because of the heaviness of the Statement which was revealed to him. When that state of Allahs Apostle was over, and he was smiling when he was relieved, the first word he said was, \"Aisha, Allah has declared your innocence.\" My mother said to me, \"Get up and go to him.\" I said, \"By Allah, I will not go to him and I will not thank anybody but Allah.\" So Allah revealed: \"Verily! They who spread the Slander are a gang among you. Think it not....\" (24.11-20). When Allah revealed this to confirm my innocence, Abu Bakr As-Siddiq who used to provide for Mistah bin Uthatha because of the latters kinship to him and his poverty, said, \"By Allah, I will never provide for Mistah anything after what he has said about Aisha\". So Allah revealed: (continued...) (continuing... 1): -6.274:... ... \"Let not those among you who are good and are wealthy swear not to give (help) to their kinsmen, those in need, and those who have left their homes for Allahs Cause. Let them Pardon and forgive (i.e. do not punish them). Do you not love that should forgive you? Verily Allah is Oft-forgiving. Most Merciful.\" (24.22) Abu Bakr said, \"Yes, by Allah, I wish that Allah should forgive me.\" So he resumed giving Mistah the aid he used to give him before and said, \"By Allah, I will never withold it from him at all.\" Aisha further said: Allahs Apostle also asked Zainab bint Jahsh about my case. He said, \"O Zainab! What have you seen?\" She replied, \"O Allahs Apostle! I protect my hearing and my sight (by refraining from telling lies). I know nothing but good (about Aisha).\" Of all the wives of Allahs Apostle, it was Zainab who aspired to receive from him the same favor as I used to receive, yet, Allah saved her (from telling lies) because of her piety. But her sister, Hamna, kept on fighting on her behalf so she was destroyed as were those who invented and spread the slander.<D>Zainab (bint Abu Salama) (Allah be pleased with her) reported:I went to Umm Habiba, the wife of Allahs Apostle (may peace be upon him), when her father Abu Sufyan had died. Umm Habiba sent for a perfume having yellowness in it or something else like it, and she applied it to a girl and then rubbed it on her cheeks and then said: By Allah, I need no perfume but for the fact that I heard Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) say on the pulpit:\" It is not permissible for a woman believing in Allah and the Hereafter to mourn for the dead beyond three days, but (in case of the death) of the husband it is permissible for four months and ten days.\" Zainab said: I then visited Zainab hint Jahsh (Allah be pleased with her) when her brother died and she sent for perfume and applied it and then said: By Allah, I dont feel any need for the perfume but that I heard Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) say on the pulpit:\" It is not permissible for a woman believing in Allah and the Hereafbler to mourn the dead beyond three days except in case of her husband (for whom she can mourn) for four months and ten days.\" Zainab (Allah be pleased with her) said: I heard my mother Umm Salama (Allah be pleased with her) as saying: A woman came to Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) and said: Allahs Messenger. I have a daughter whose husband has died and there has developed some trouble in her eye; should we apply collyrium to it? Thereupon Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: No (repeating it twice or thrice, saying only, NO\" all the time). Then he said: It is only four mouths and ten days, whereas in the preIslamic period none of you threw away the dung until one year had passed. Humaid said: I said to Zainab: What is this throwing of dung until a year is passed? Zainab said: When the husband of a woman died, she went into a hut and put on her worst clothes, and did not apply perfume or something like it until a year was over. Then an animal like a donkey, or a goat, or a bird was brought to her and she rubbed her hand over it, and it so happened that one on which she rubbed her hand died. She then came out of her house and she was given dung and she threw it and then she made use of anything like perfume or something else as she liked.<D>(Divorce must be pronounced twice) He says: the divorce in which a man is entitled to take back his wife is pronounced once on two separate occasions (and then (a woman) must be retained) before she is pronounced divorced a third time and before performing major ritual ablution from the third menstruation (in honour) with kind companionship and intercourse (or released in kindness) or divorced a third time with such kindness as restores her rights. (And it is not lawful for you that ye take from women aught of that which ye have given them) of dowry; (except (in the case) when both arbiters) when the husband and wifeboth know that she wants to ransom her divorce (fear that they may not be able to keep the limits (imposed by) Allah) the rulings of Allah regulating the relationship between husband and wife. (And if ye fear) if you know (that they may not be able to keep the limits (imposed by) Allah) the rulings of Allah regulating the relationship between husband and wife, (in that case it is no sin for either of them) and especially the husband (if the woman ransom herself) if the husband takes what the woman ransoms herself with, out of the generosity of her soul. This verse was revealed about Thabit Ibn Qays Ibn Shammas whose wife Jamilah was the daughter of Abdullah Ibn Ubayy Ibn Salul, chief of the hypocrites. This woman ransomed her divorce from her husband by giving him back what he gave her as dowry. (These are the limits of Allah) the rulings of Allah regulating the relationship between husband and wife, (Transgress them not) do not step beyond that which Allah has prohibited. (For whoso transgresseth Allahs limits) steps beyond them: (such are wrong-doers) harmful to themselves.<D>(And of His signs) of the signs of His divine Oneness and power (is this: He created for you spouses) human beings like yourselves (from yourselves that ye might find rest in them) so that the husband may find rest in his wife, (and He ordained between you) husband and wife (love) love of the wife for her husband (and mercy) of the husband towards his wife; it is also said that this means: love of the young ones of the old ones and mercy from the older ones towards the young ones. (Lo, herein) in that which I have mentioned (indeed are portents) signs and lessons (for folk who reflect) upon what Allah created.<D>(And (it was said unto him): Take in thine hand) O Job (a branch) of 100 spikes of grain (and smite therewith) and smite with it your wife, Rahmah the daughter of the Prophet Joseph, (and break not thine oath) this is because he vowed before that if Allah were to cure him, he would flog his wife 100 lashes because she said something which did not please Allah. (Lo! We found him steadfast) in trial, (how excellent a slave! Lo! he was ever turning in repentance (to his Lord)) he is ever obedient to Allah and betaking himself to Allahs obedience.", "Generated_Answer": "Dear T,\n\nYour story is incredibly poignant, and it takes immense courage to reflect on such a difficult past and its present impact. First, please know that your feelings are valid. You survived a profoundly abusive situation, and the depression you experienced is a natural, albeit painful, consequence of such trauma. It's also deeply heartbreaking when the very patterns you fought against seem to re-emerge in your children.\n\nLet's break down what's happening and how you can approach it with love, clarity, and self-preservation.\n\n### Understanding the Intergenerational Cycle\n\nWhat you are witnessing in your daughter is a common, though painful, phenomenon known as an **intergenerational pattern** or the impact of **intergenerational trauma**.\n\n1.  **Learned Behavior:** Your children grew up witnessing a powerful dynamic. Your husband, their father, modeled jealousy, accusation, and abuse. Even though your daughter isn't physically abusing you, she has learned a pattern of relating to others (especially women) through a lens of jealousy and criticism. This is often an unconscious mirroring of what they saw modeled by a dominant parent figure.\n2.  **Trauma Response:** Your daughter's jealousy might also stem from her own unresolved feelings about her father's behavior and the atmosphere she grew up in. She might have deep-seated insecurities (e.g., \"Am I loved enough?\", \"Will I be replaced?\") that manifest as jealousy towards others, especially when she perceives them receiving attention or affection.\n3.  **Seeking Control/Validation:** People who grew up in chaotic or abusive environments sometimes try to exert control over their current relationships or seek validation by criticizing others. If she saw her father gain power through accusation, she might subconsciously be replicating that, even if it’s painful for you.\n\n### Why She Feels You Hate Her (and How to Address It)\n\nWhen you disagree with her criticisms, she likely interprets it as:\n\n*   **Rejection of Her Feelings:** \"Mom doesn't understand me or validate my perspective.\"\n*   **Taking Others' Side:** \"Mom loves them more than me.\" This ties into the jealousy.\n*   **A Threat to Her Worldview:** If her view of others (especially female relatives) is negative, your positive view challenges her internal narrative.\n\nHere’s how to make her believe otherwise, while also protecting your peace:\n\n1.  **Express Unconditional Love Directly and Often:**\n    *   **Say it:** \"Daughter, I love you very much. You are my daughter, and that love is unconditional.\"\n    *   **Show it through actions:** Spend quality time doing things she enjoys (that don't involve gossip or criticism).\n    *   **Reassure her:** \"Nothing you say or do will make me stop loving you.\"\n\n2.  **Validate Her Feelings (Not Her Actions or Words):**\n    *   When she expresses jealousy or frustration, you can say, \"I hear that you're feeling really [frustrated/jealous/upset] right now.\" *This validates her emotion.*\n    *   **Then, immediately set the boundary:** \"And because I love you, I need to tell you that I cannot agree with speaking negatively about [DIL/niece]. That hurts me to hear, and it's not fair to them.\"\n    *   **Example:** \"I understand you might feel a bit left out when [niece] gets a lot of attention, and those feelings are valid. But talking badly about her isn't okay with me, and it doesn't help.\"\n\n3.  **Set Clear and Consistent Boundaries About Negative Talk:** This is crucial for your well-being and to model healthy communication.\n    *   **State your boundary clearly:** \"Daughter, I love spending time with you, but I need us to have positive conversations. When you start talking negatively about other people, I will need to change the subject or end the conversation/call.\"\n    *   **Follow through:**\n        *   **Change the subject:** \"Let's talk about something else. How was your day?\"\n        *   **If she persists:** \"Daughter, I love you, but as I said, I can't listen to this. I'm going to have to end our call/take a break from this conversation now. We can talk again later when we can focus on something positive.\"\n        *   **Then do it.** End the call, walk away. This shows her you mean what you say and that negative talk has consequences for your interaction. It's not about *punishing* her, but protecting yourself and your relationship.\n    *   **Explain *why* (from your perspective):** \"Listening to constant criticism brings up painful memories for me, and it doesn't align with how I want to live my life or how I want our relationship to be.\"\n\n4.  **Shift the Focus to Your Relationship with Her:**\n    *   Instead of letting her define your interactions by others' perceived flaws, actively talk about *your* shared experiences, memories, and future plans.\n    *   \"I want our time together to be about us, building good memories, not about what others are or aren't doing.\"\n\n5.  **Encourage Self-Reflection (Gently, if Possible):**\n    *   At a calm moment, you might gently say, \"Honey, I've noticed that sometimes you get very focused on what other people are doing, especially [DIL/niece]. How does that make *you* feel? Do you think it makes you feel better or worse?\"\n    *   Connect it to the past, if appropriate: \"I know you saw how much your father's jealousy hurt me, and I don't want you to carry that burden or let it affect your happiness.\"\n\n### Your Well-being is Paramount\n\n*   **Individual Therapy for You:** You've endured significant trauma. A therapist can help you process your past abuse, the depression, and navigate these difficult dynamics with your children. They can provide strategies for setting boundaries and rebuilding your own peace.\n*   **Consider Suggesting Therapy for Her (Very Carefully):** You can't force her, but if she's open, you might suggest, \"Honey, I love you so much, and I see how much this jealousy weighs on you. It makes you unhappy. Have you ever considered talking to someone who could help you sort through these feelings? It's helped me immensely.\"\n*   **Don't Internalize Her Accusations:** When she says you hate her, remember this comes from her insecurity and learned patterns, not from truth. Remind yourself of your love and your actions.\n*   **Patience and Consistency:** Changing these patterns takes a long time. There will be setbacks. Be patient with yourself and with her, but remain consistent with your boundaries.\n\nYou are a strong woman who has navigated immense challenges. Continue to lead with love, but also with healthy boundaries. You deserve peace, and by modeling healthy behavior and clear communication, you are not only protecting yourself but also offering your daughter a different, healthier path forward."}

Let's break it down from a general ethical and religious perspective (often drawing from common Christian theological principles regarding sin, as \"sin\" is the term used).\n\n**Core Principles:**\n\n1.  **Direct Responsibility and Intent:** You are generally responsible for actions you directly commit with intent. If you *intend* to do wrong, that is a sin.\n2.  **Cooperation in Evil:** This is where it gets complex.\n    *   **Formal Cooperation:** This occurs when you share the evil intent of the person committing the wrong action. This is always morally illicit and sinful. For example, if a pharmacist *wants* someone to get drunk and sells them alcohol-containing cough syrup for that specific purpose.\n    *   **Material Cooperation:** This occurs when you assist in an evil act without sharing the evil intent. This can be further divided:\n        *   **Immediate Material Cooperation:** Directly participating in the execution of the evil act. This is usually morally illicit.\n        *   **Mediate Material Cooperation:** Providing the means or conditions for the evil act, but not directly participating in its execution. This can sometimes be morally permissible depending on the circumstances, such as:\n            *   The act itself is not intrinsically evil (e.g., selling a legitimate medicine).\n            *   There is a serious reason for cooperation (e.g., fulfilling professional duties, avoiding job loss).\n            *   The degree of cooperation is remote.\n            *   The bad effect is not directly willed, but tolerated.\n3.  **Principle of Double Effect:** An action with both a good and a bad effect can be morally permissible if:\n    *   The act itself is good or neutral.\n    *   The good effect is intended, and the bad effect is merely foreseen but not intended.\n    *   The good effect is not achieved by means of the bad effect.\n    *   There is a proportionate reason for allowing the bad effect to occur.\n\n**Applying to the Pharmacist:**\n\n*   **The Pharmacist's Primary Intent:** A pharmacist's primary professional and moral intent when dispensing medicine is to aid in the healing and well-being of the patient, as prescribed by a doctor or as an over-the-counter remedy.\n*   **Nature of the Product:** Medicines containing alcohol (e.g., some cough syrups, tinctures) are legitimate pharmaceutical products. The alcohol often serves a purpose (solvent, preservative, or even a therapeutic effect in some cases). The product itself is not intrinsically evil.\n*   **The Patient's Misuse:** If a patient chooses to misuse a medicine (e.g., drink cough syrup for intoxication), the sin lies with the patient who is misusing the substance, not primarily with the pharmacist who dispensed it for its intended medicinal purpose.\n\n**When the Pharmacist *Might* Bear Some Culpability (Moving from No Sin to Potential Concern):**\n\nThis is where your point about \"other medicines that do not use alcohol can be used in their place\" becomes relevant.\n\n1.  **Knowledge of Intent and Alternatives:**\n    *   If a pharmacist *knows* that a particular customer is habitually abusing alcohol-containing medicines for intoxication (e.g., they buy large quantities frequently, show signs of intoxication, specifically ask for high-alcohol versions when other options are refused).\n    *   **AND** if there are readily available, medically equivalent, and suitable non-alcohol alternatives.\n    *   In such a scenario, a pharmacist might have a moral obligation (and often a professional one) to:\n        *   **Question the patient:** \"Is this for a cough or something else?\"\n        *   **Offer the non-alcohol alternative:** \"We also have this one which doesn't contain alcohol, and it works just as well for coughs.\"\n        *   **Refuse the sale:** In extreme cases, if the pharmacist is certain the person will misuse it and there's a clear, safer alternative that the patient refuses, they might be morally obliged to refuse the sale, particularly if their professional code allows for it when misuse is suspected. This would fall under avoiding *mediate material cooperation* in a morally questionable act when reasonable alternatives exist and the pharmacist has specific knowledge of intended misuse.\n\n2.  **Formal Cooperation (Rare):** If the pharmacist deliberately conspires with the customer, intending for them to get drunk from the medicine, then yes, that would be sinful cooperation. This is highly unlikely in a professional setting.\n\n3.  **Scandal:** If the pharmacist's actions (e.g., openly encouraging the use of alcohol-containing medicine for non-medicinal purposes, or ignoring obvious abuse) were to lead others to believe that such misuse is acceptable or without consequence, that could also be a form of indirect moral culpability (scandal).\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nIn most ordinary circumstances, a pharmacist selling medicines with alcohol is **not committing a sin**. Their intent is medicinal, and the product itself is legitimate. The primary sin of misuse lies with the patient.\n\nHowever, a pharmacist does have a professional and moral responsibility to exercise prudence. If they have reasonable grounds to believe a patient is misusing the product for intoxication, and a medically suitable non-alcohol alternative is readily available, a conscientious pharmacist should:\n\n*   Prioritize the non-alcohol alternative.\n*   Educate the patient about the risks of misuse.\n*   Potentially refuse the sale of the alcohol-containing version if abuse is clear and there's no legitimate medical need for *that specific* formulation over alternatives.\n\nThis moves from a simple transaction to a situation where the pharmacist's *knowledge* and the *availability of alternatives* introduce a higher degree of moral consideration regarding cooperation in a potential wrong. It's about exercising responsible care and avoiding facilitating known harmful behavior when reasonable alternatives exist."}
{"Question": "Q: I am working in Dubai airport. I am in Cargo handling department. We are handling all cargo coming to Dubai and going from Dubai Airport. My job is doing all the documentation, counting the no. of pieces, making it ready for flight, storing cargo in the warehouse racks using forklift. Sometime the cargo will be alcohol or cigarettes. But it is less than 5% of all cargo we handle. Some cargo we dont know what is inside the packing. I dont use the money I am getting for the hour which I spend for alcohol or cigar. May be it is only 1 hour in one month. Is the job halaal or haram? ? --T--", "Answer": "The job is halaal, however you should refrain from having any involvement with alcohol or anything haraam. And Allah Taala ( ) knows best", "Document": "Narrated `Aisha:(the wife of the Prophet) \"I do not remember my parents believing in any religion other than the Religion (of Islam), and our being visited by Allahs Apostle in the morning and in the evening. One day, while we were sitting in the house of Abu Bakr (my father) at noon, someone said, This is Allahs Apostle coming at an hour at which he never used to visit us. Abu Bakr said, There must be something very urgent that has brought him at this hour. The Prophet said, I have been allowed to go out (of Mecca) to migrate. \"<D>Narrated Aisha:(the wife of the Prophet) \"Whenever Allahs Apostle intended to go on a journey, he would draw lots amongst his wives and would take with him the one upon whom the lot fell. During a Ghazwa of his, he drew lots amongst us and the lot fell upon me, and I proceeded with him after Allah had decreed the use of the veil by women. I was carried in a Howdah (on the camel) and dismounted while still in it. When Allahs Apostle was through with his Ghazwa and returned home, and we approached the city of Medina, Allahs Apostle ordered us to proceed at night. When the order of setting off was given, I walked till I was past the army to answer the call of nature. After finishing I returned (to the camp) to depart (with the others) and suddenly realized that my necklace over my chest was missing. So, I returned to look for it and was delayed because of that. The people who used to carry me on the camel, came to my Howdah and put it on the back of the camel, thinking that I was in it, as, at that time, women were light in weight, and thin and lean, and did not use to eat much. So, those people did not feel the difference in the heaviness of the Howdah while lifting it, and they put it over the camel. At that time I was a young lady. They set the camel moving and proceeded on. I found my necklace after the army had gone, and came to their camp to find nobody. So, I went to the place where I used to stay, thinking that they would discover my absence and come back in my search. While in that state, I felt sleepy and slept. Safwan bin Muattal As-Sulami Adh-Dhakwani was behind the army and reached my abode in the morning. When he saw a sleeping person, he came to me, and he used to see me before veiling. So, I got up when I heard him saying, \"Inna lil-lah-wa inn a ilaihi rajiun (We are for Allah, and we will return to Him).\" He made his camel knell down. He got down from his camel, and put his leg on the front legs of the camel and then I rode and sat over it. Safwan set out walking, leading the camel by the rope till we reached the army who had halted to take rest at midday. Then whoever was meant for destruction, fell into destruction, (some people accused me falsely) and the leader of the false accusers was `Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul. After that we returned to Medina, and I became ill for one month while the people were spreading the forged statements of the false accusers. I was feeling during my ailment as if I were not receiving the usual kindness from the Prophet which I used to receive from him when I got sick. But he would come, greet and say, How is that (girl)? I did not know anything of what was going on till I recovered from my ailment and went out with Um Mistah to the Manasi where we used to answer the call of nature, and we used not to go to answer the call of nature except from night to night and that was before we had lavatories near to our houses. And this habit of ours was similar to the habit of the old Arabs in the open country (or away from houses). So. I and Um Mistah bint Ruhm went out walking. Um Mistah stumbled because of her long dress and on that she said, Let Mistah be ruined. I said, You are saying a bad word. Why are you abusing a man who took part in (the battle of) Badr? She said, O Hanata (you there) didnt you hear what they said? Then she told me the rumors of the false accusers. My sickness was aggravated, and when I returned home, Allahs Apostle came to me, and after greeting he said, How is that (girl)? I requested him to allow me to go to my parents. I wanted then to be sure of the news through them I Allahs Apostle allowed me, and I went to my parents and asked my mother, What are the people talking about? She said, O my daughter! Dont worry much about this matter. By Allah, never is there a charming woman loved by her husband who has other wives, but the women would forge false news about her. I said, Glorified be Allah! Are the people really taking of this matter? That night I kept on weeping and could not sleep till morning. In the morning Allahs Apostle called `Ali bin Abu Talib and Usama bin Zaid when he saw the Divine Inspiration delayed, to consul them about divorcing his wife (i.e. `Aisha). Usama bin Zaid said what he knew of the good reputation of his wives and added, O Allahs Apostle! Keep you wife, for, by Allah, we know nothing about her but good. `Ali bin Abu Talib said, O Allahs Apostle! Allah has no imposed restrictions on you, and there are many women other than she, yet you may ask the woman-servant who will tell you the truth. On that Allahs Apostle called Buraira and said, O Burair. Did you ever see anything which roused your suspicions about her? Buraira said, No, by Allah Who has sent you with the Truth, I have never seen in her anything faulty except that she is a girl of immature age, who sometimes sleeps and leaves the dough for the goats to eat. On that day Allahs Apostle ascended the pulpit and requested that somebody support him in punishing `Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul. Allahs Apostle said, Who will support me to punish that person (`Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul) who has hurt me by slandering the reputation of my family? By Allah, I know nothing about my family but good, and they have accused a person about whom I know nothing except good, and he never entered my house except in my company. Sa`d bin Mu`adh got up and said, O Allahs Apostle! by Allah, I will relieve you from him. If that man is from the tribe of the Aus, then we will chop his head off, and if he is from our brothers, the Khazraj, then order us, and we will fulfill your order. On that Sa`d bin Ubada, the chief of the Khazraj and before this incident, he had been a pious man, got up, motivated by his zeal for his tribe and said, By Allah, you have told a lie; you cannot kill him, and you will never be able to kill him. On that Usaid bin Al-Hadir got up and said (to Sa`d bin Ubada), By Allah! you are a liar. By Allah, we will kill him; and you are a hypocrite, defending the hypocrites. On this the two tribes of Aus and Khazraj got excited and were about to fight each other, while Allahs Apostle was standing on the pulpit. He got down and quieted them till they became silent and he kept quiet. On that day I kept on weeping so much so that neither did my tears stop, nor could I sleep. In the morning my parents were with me and I had wept for two nights and a day, till I thought my liver would burst from weeping. While they were sitting with me and I was weeping, an Ansari woman asked my permission to enter, and I allowed her to come in. She sat down and started weeping with me. While we were in this state, Allahs Apostle came and sat down and he had never sat with me since the day they forged the accusation. No revelation regarding my case came to him for a month. He recited Tashah-hud (i.e. None has the right to be worshipped but Allah and Muhammad is His Apostle) and then said, O `Aisha! I have been informed such-and-such about you; if you are innocent, then Allah will soon reveal your innocence, and if you have committed a sin, then repent to Allah and ask Him to forgive you, for when a person confesses his sin and asks Allah for forgiveness, Allah accepts his repentance. When Allahs Apostle finished his speech my tears ceased completely and there remained not even a single drop of it. I requested my father to reply to Allahs Apostle on my behalf. My father said, By Allah, I do not know what to say to Allahs Apostle. I said to my mother, Talk to Allahs Apostle on my behalf. She said, By Allah, I do not know what to say to Allahs Apostle. I was a young girl and did not have much knowledge of the Quran. I said. I know, by Allah, that you have listened to what people are saying and that has been planted in your minds and you have taken it as a truth. Now, if I told you that I am innocent and Allah knows that I am innocent, you would not believe me and if I confessed to you falsely that I am guilty, and Allah knows that I am innocent you would believe me. By Allah, I dont compare my situation with you except to the situation of Josephs father (i.e. Jacob) who said, So (for me) patience is most fitting against that which you assert and it is Allah (Alone) whose help can be sought. Then I turned to the other side of my bed hoping that Allah would prove my innocence. By Allah I never thought that Allah would reveal Divine Inspiration in my case, as I considered myself too inferior to be talked of in the Holy Quran. I had hoped that Allahs Apostle might have a dream in which Allah would prove my innocence. By Allah, Allahs Apostle had not got up and nobody had left the house before the Divine Inspiration came to Allahs Apostle. So, there overtook him the same state which used to overtake him, (when he used to have, on being inspired divinely). He was sweating so much so that the drops of the sweat were dropping like pearls though it was a (cold) wintry day. When that state of Allahs Apostle was over, he was smiling and the first word he said, `Aisha! Thank Allah, for Allah has declared your innocence. My mother told me to go to Allahs Apostle . I replied, By Allah I will not go to him and will not thank but Allah. So Allah revealed: \"Verily! They who spread the slander are a gang among you . . .\" (24.11) When Allah gave the declaration of my Innocence, Abu Bakr, who used to provide for Mistah bin Uthatha for he was his relative, said, By Allah, I will never provide Mistah with anything because of what he said about Aisha. But Allah later revealed: -- \"And let not those who are good and wealthy among you swear not to help their kinsmen, those in need and those who left their homes in Allahs Cause. Let them forgive and overlook. Do you not wish that Allah should forgive you? Verily! Allah is Oft-forgiving, Most Merciful.\" (24.22) After that Abu Bakr said, Yes ! By Allah! I like that Allah should forgive me, and resumed helping Mistah whom he used to help before. Allahs Apostle also asked Zainab bint Jahsh (i.e. the Prophets wife about me saying, What do you know and what did you see? She replied, O Allahs Apostle! I refrain to claim hearing or seeing what I have not heard or seen. By Allah, I know nothing except goodness about Aisha.\" Aisha further added \"Zainab was competing with me (in her beauty and the Prophets love), yet Allah protected her (from being malicious), for she had piety.\"<D>Narrated Ibn `Abbas:The first lady to use a girdle was the mother of Ishmael. She used a girdle so that she might hide her tracks from Sarah. Abraham brought her and her son Ishmael while she was suckling him, to a place near the Ka`ba under a tree on the spot of Zamzam, at the highest place in the mosque. During those days there was nobody in Mecca, nor was there any water So he made them sit over there and placed near them a leather bag containing some dates, and a small water-skin containing some water, and set out homeward. Ishmaels mother followed him saying, \"O Abraham! Where are you going, leaving us in this valley where there is no person whose company we may enjoy, nor is there anything (to enjoy)?\" She repeated that to him many times, but he did not look back at her Then she asked him, \"Has Allah ordered you to do so?\" He said, \"Yes.\" She said, \"Then He will not neglect us,\" and returned while Abraham proceeded onwards, and on reaching the Thaniya where they could not see him, he faced the Ka`ba, and raising both hands, invoked Allah saying the following prayers: O our Lord! I have made some of my offspring dwell in a valley without cultivation, by Your Sacred House (Ka`ba at Mecca) in order, O our Lord, that they may offer prayer perfectly. So fill some hearts among men with love towards them, and (O Allah) provide them with fruits, so that they may give thanks. (14.37) Ishmaels mother went on suckling Ishmael and drinking from the water (she had). When the water in the water-skin had all been used up, she became thirsty and her child also became thirsty. She started looking at him (i.e. Ishmael) tossing in agony; She left him, for she could not endure looking at him, and found that the mountain of Safa was the nearest mountain to her on that land. She stood on it and started looking at the valley keenly so that she might see somebody, but she could not see anybody. Then she descended from Safa and when she reached the valley, she tucked up her robe and ran in the valley like a person in distress and trouble, till she crossed the valley and reached the Marwa mountain where she stood and started looking, expecting to see somebody, but she could not see anybody. She repeated that (running between Safa and Marwa) seven times.\" The Prophet said, \"This is the source of the tradition of the walking of people between them (i.e. Safa and Marwa). When she reached the Marwa (for the last time) she heard a voice and she asked herself to be quiet and listened attentively. She heard the voice again and said, O, (whoever you may be)! You have made me hear your voice; have you got something to help me?\" And behold! She saw an angel at the place of Zamzam, digging the earth with his heel (or his wing), till water flowed from that place. She started to make something like a basin around it, using her hand in this way, and started filling her water-skin with water with her hands, and the water was flowing out after she had scooped some of it.\" The Prophet added, \"May Allah bestow Mercy on Ishmaels mother! Had she let the Zamzam (flow without trying to control it) (or had she not scooped from that water) (to fill her water-skin), Zamzam would have been a stream flowing on the surface of the earth.\" The Prophet further added, \"Then she drank (water) and suckled her child. The angel said to her, Dont be afraid of being neglected, for this is the House of Allah which will be built by this boy and his father, and Allah never neglects His people. The House (i.e. Ka`ba) at that time was on a high place resembling a hillock, and when torrents came, they flowed to its right and left. She lived in that way till some people from the tribe of Jurhum or a family from Jurhum passed by her and her child, as they (i.e. the Jurhum people) were coming through the way of Kada. They landed in the lower part of Mecca where they saw a bird that had the habit of flying around water and not leaving it. They said, This bird must be flying around water, though we know that there is no water in this valley. They sent one or two messengers who discovered the source of water, and returned to inform them of the water. So, they all came (towards the water).\" The Prophet added, \"Ishmaels mother was sitting near the water. They asked her, Do you allow us to stay with you?\" She replied, Yes, but you will have no right to possess the water. They agreed to that.\" The Prophet further said, \"Ishmaels mother was pleased with the whole situation as she used to love to enjoy the company of the people. So, they settled there, and later on they sent for their families who came and settled with them so that some families became permanent residents there. The child (i.e. Ishmael) grew up and learnt Arabic from them and (his virtues) caused them to love and admire him as he grew up, and when he reached the age of puberty they made him marry a woman from amongst them. After Ishmaels mother had died, Abraham came after Ishmaels marriage in order to see his family that he had left before, but he did not find Ishmael there. When he asked Ishmaels wife about him, she replied, He has gone in search of our livelihood. Then he asked her about their way of living and their condition, and she replied, We are living in misery; we are living in hardship and destitution, complaining to him. He said, When your husband returns, convey my salutation to him and tell him to change the threshold of the gate (of his house). When Ishmael came, he seemed to have felt something unusual, so he asked his wife, Has anyone visited you? She replied, Yes, an old man of so-and-so description came and asked me about you and I informed him, and he asked about our state of living, and I told him that we were living in a hardship and poverty. On that Ishmael said, Did he advise you anything? She replied, Yes, he told me to convey his salutation to you and to tell you to change the threshold of your gate. Ishmael said, It was my father, and he has ordered me to divorce you. Go back to your family. So, Ishmael divorced her and married another woman from amongst them (i.e. Jurhum). Then Abraham stayed away from them for a period as long as Allah wished and called on them again but did not find Ishmael. So he came to Ishmaels wife and asked her about Ishmael. She said, He has gone in search of our livelihood. Abraham asked her, How are you getting on? asking her about their sustenance and living. She replied, We are prosperous and well-off (i.e. we have everything in abundance). Then she thanked Allah Abraham said, What kind of food do you eat? She said. Meat. He said, What do you drink? She said, Water.\" He said, \"O Allah! Bless their meat and water.\" The Prophet added, \"At that time they did not have grain, and if they had grain, he would have also invoked Allah to bless it.\" The Prophet added, \"If somebody has only these two things as his sustenance, his health and disposition will be badly affected, unless he lives in Mecca.\" The Prophet added,\" Then Abraham said Ishmaels wife, \"When your husband comes, give my regards to him and tell him that he should keep firm the threshold of his gate. When Ishmael came back, he asked his wife, Did anyone call on you? She replied, Yes, a good-looking old man came to me, so she praised him and added. He asked about you, and I informed him, and he asked about our livelihood and I told him that we were in a good condition. Ishmael asked her, Did he give you any piece of advice? She said, Yes, he told me to give his regards to you and ordered that you should keep firm the threshold of your gate. On that Ishmael said, It was my father, and you are the threshold (of the gate). He has ordered me to keep you with me. Then Abraham stayed away from them for a period as long as Allah wished, and called on them afterwards. He saw Ishmael under a tree near Zamzam, sharpening his arrows. When he saw Abraham, he rose up to welcome him (and they greeted each other as a father does with his son or a son does with his father). Abraham said, O Ishmael! Allah has given me an order. Ishmael said, Do what your Lord has ordered you to do. Abraham asked, Will you help me? Ishmael said, I will help you. Abraham said, Allah has ordered me to build a house here, pointing to a hillock higher than the land surrounding it.\" The Prophet added, \"Then they raised the foundations of the House (i.e. the Ka`ba). Ishmael brought the stones and Abraham was building, and when the walls became high, Ishmael brought this stone and put it for Abraham who stood over it and carried on building, while Ishmael was handing him the stones, and both of them were saying, O our Lord! Accept (this service) from us, Verily, You are the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing. The Prophet added, \"Then both of them went on building and going round the Ka`ba saying: O our Lord ! Accept (this service) from us, Verily, You are the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing.\" (2.127)<D>(And when it was said) to them in the life of the world: (Lo!

You are not directly involved in the production, sale, or consumption of alcohol or cigarettes.\n\n2.  **Minimal Involvement with Haram Items:** The fact that alcohol and cigarettes constitute less than 5% of all cargo you handle is a significant factor. In Islamic jurisprudence, if the vast majority of an activity is permissible, and a very small, incidental, and often unavoidable part involves something impermissible, the overall activity might still be considered permissible. This is especially true if you are not directly promoting or profiting from the impermissible aspect.\n\n3.  **Indirect vs. Direct Assistance:** Your role is more of an indirect, logistical handler within a large, general cargo operation, rather than directly assisting in a sin. For example, a person directly serving alcohol or selling cigarettes would have a different ruling because their primary role is the forbidden act itself. Your primary role is handling *all* cargo, most of which is permissible.\n\n4.  **Unknown Contents:** For cargo where you don't know what's inside, you are not held accountable for something you are unaware of, especially when your primary duty is generic cargo handling and not specifically to deal with forbidden items. The default assumption for unknown items is permissibility unless there's strong reason to believe otherwise.\n\n5.  **Your Intention and Usage of Earnings:** It's commendable that you avoid using any part of your earnings for forbidden items. While this doesn't *make* a haram job halal, it shows your good intention and adherence to Islamic principles in your personal consumption.\n\n**Scholarly Perspective:** Many contemporary scholars, particularly when dealing with large, complex modern industries, would lean towards permissibility in such cases. They often apply the principle of \"ghalabat al-halal\" (predominance of the permissible), where if the vast majority of an income or activity is from permissible sources, the minor, incidental, and unavoidable haram component does not render the entire income or activity forbidden.\n\n**Recommendation:**\nWhile your job appears permissible, it's always good practice for a Muslim to:\n*   **Continue seeking knowledge:** Learn more about Islamic rulings on livelihood.\n*   **Make Dua:** Ask Allah to grant you a fully pure and blessed livelihood.\n*   **Be Mindful:** If, for example, the percentage of forbidden goods were to significantly increase, or if your role became more directly involved in promoting them, then the ruling might change, and you would need to re-evaluate.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nGiven that the vast majority of your work involves permissible tasks and your involvement with haram items is minimal, indirect, and incidental to your primary role, your job at Dubai airport cargo handling department is likely considered **halaal**."}

Let's break this down to clarify the situation based on Islamic teachings.\n\nFirst, take a deep breath. Islam is a religion of ease, and Allah does not burden a soul beyond its capacity. Many people experience confusion about these matters, and it's a common area for *waswas* (obsessive whisperings from Shaytan).\n\n**Understanding Different Types of Discharge and Their Rulings:**\n\nTo determine if you are \"napaak\" (ritually impure), we need to consider the type of discharge:\n\n1.  **Normal Vaginal Discharge:** This is a healthy and common physiological process for women.\n    *   **Characteristics:** Usually clear, whitish, or yellowish, generally odorless or with a mild odor, not typically associated with sexual arousal.\n    *   **Islamic Ruling:**\n        *   **Breaks Wudu (Ablution):** Yes, the emission of any discharge from the private parts (except specific conditions like continuous discharge for those with incontinence, where special rules apply) generally breaks Wudu. So, you would need to perform Wudu again before praying or touching the Quran.\n        *   **Requires Ghusl (Full Bath):** No. Normal vaginal discharge does not necessitate Ghusl.\n        *   **Is it Najasah (Physically Impure) on Clothes/Objects?** This is where there's a difference of opinion among scholars, but the **majority and stronger opinion, especially for ease, is that normal vaginal discharge is PURE (Tahir)**. It does not make your clothes or anything it touches impure. This is the view of the Maliki, Shafi'i, and Hanbali schools (in one narration), and it aligns with the principle of ease and the common occurrence of such discharge.\n\n2.  **Madhi (Pre-ejaculatory Fluid):**\n    *   **Characteristics:** Thin, clear or whitish, sticky fluid that is usually discharged during arousal, even if subtle or unintentional. You mentioned not thinking sexually, which makes this less likely, but sometimes subconscious arousal or thoughts can trigger it.\n    *   **Islamic Ruling:**\n        *   **Breaks Wudu:** Yes.\n        *   **Requires Ghusl:** No.\n        *   **Is it Najasah?** Yes, it is considered impure (*najasah*). If it gets on your clothes, you should wash the area that it touched or sprinkle water over it.\n\n3.  **Wadi (Post-urination Fluid):**\n    *   **Characteristics:** Thick, whitish, cloudy fluid that typically comes out after urinating, especially if the bladder isn't fully emptied.\n    *   **Islamic Ruling:**\n        *   **Breaks Wudu:** Yes.\n        *   **Requires Ghusl:** No.\n        *   **Is it Najasah?** Yes, it is considered impure (*najasah*).\n\n4.  **Mani (Semen/Ejaculate):**\n    *   **Characteristics:** Thick, whitish fluid, usually discharged with pleasure, often in spurts, and followed by a feeling of relaxation. You specifically said you weren't thinking sexually, so this is highly unlikely.\n    *   **Islamic Ruling:**\n        *   **Breaks Wudu:** Yes.\n        *   **Requires Ghusl:** Yes, it necessitates a full ritual bath (Ghusl).\n        *   **Is it Najasah?** There is a difference of opinion; the preferred view in some schools (e.g., Shafi'i, Hanbali) is that it is pure (*tahir*) in itself, but its emission necessitates Ghusl.\n\n---\n\n**Answering Your Specific Questions:**\n\nGiven your description (\"wasn't thinking about anything sexual but I felt weird\"), it sounds most like **normal vaginal discharge**. It could potentially be *Wadi* if it was immediately after urinating and thick, or *Madhi* if there was any subtle arousal you weren't fully aware of.\n\n1.  **Am I napaak now?**\n    *   **Regarding Wudu:** Yes, your Wudu is broken. You would need to perform Wudu again before praying or engaging in acts that require Wudu (like touching the Mus'haf/Quran).\n    *   **Regarding Ghusl:** No, you do not need Ghusl based on your description, as it does not sound like *Mani*.\n    *   **Regarding Physical Impurity (Najasah):**\n        *   **If it was normal vaginal discharge (most likely):** Then no, your body and clothes are **not physically impure (najasah)**. You don't need to wash your clothes beyond your regular washing routine. The area where the discharge came from should be cleaned as part of *istinja* (what you did with water and tissue).\n        *   **If it was Madhi or Wadi:** Then yes, the discharge itself is *najasah*. You should wash the area on your body it touched. If it got on your clothes, you should wash that specific spot on your clothes.\n\n2.  **If I use textbooks and sit on places or use my phone and laptop will they become napaak?**\n\n    *   **No, generally they will NOT become napaak.**\n    *   **If it was normal vaginal discharge:** Since this is considered pure (tahir) by the stronger opinion, it will not make anything impure.\n    *   **If it was Madhi or Wadi:** For an object to become impure, the *wet impurity* must transfer directly onto it.\n        *   If you cleaned yourself properly with water and tissue, and the discharge was contained, then there's no reason for your belongings to become impure.\n        *   Even if a tiny amount of *Madhi* or *Wadi* were to transfer (e.g., on your hand, and then you touched your phone), only that specific spot on the object would be considered impure. The *entire* object doesn't become \"napaak.\" And for objects, sometimes just wiping the spot with a wet cloth is sufficient.\n        *   You sitting on a place, or using your phone/laptop *after* cleaning yourself, means there's no transfer of wet impurity, so your belongings remain pure.\n\n**Summary and Reassurance:**\n\n*   You most likely experienced **normal vaginal discharge**, which breaks Wudu but is **not physically impure** (i.e., it doesn't make your clothes or objects impure).\n*   Even if it was *Madhi* or *Wadi* (which are impure), as long as you cleaned yourself and the wet impurity didn't directly transfer to your belongings, they remain pure.\n*   The fact that you were not thinking sexually strongly suggests it wasn't *Mani* (which would require Ghusl).\n*   **Your primary concern should be renewing your Wudu before praying.**\n\n**Important Advice:**\n\n*   **Don't overthink it:** This level of concern often leads to *waswas*. Islam intends for purity to be easy and accessible. If you're not absolutely certain that a *najasah* (like urine, faeces, blood, madhi, wadi) has transferred in a wet state, then assume purity.\n*   **Normalcy:** It's completely normal to have vaginal discharge.\n*   **Cleanliness:** Continue your good practice of cleaning yourself with water after using the bathroom.\n\nMay Allah grant you ease and clarity in your practice."}
{"Question": "Can a good Muslim learn an art such as classical Indian dancing in order to stay healthy and learn physical discipline?? --T--", "Answer": "Walaikum assalam wa rahmatullah, It is permitted to do things that do not entail the impermissible or reprehensible.

Positive Aspects (Generally Encouraged in Islam):**\n\n*   **Physical Health:** Learning any dance form, including classical Indian dancing (like Bharatanatyam, Kathak, Odissi, etc.), offers numerous health benefits. It improves cardiovascular health, flexibility, strength, balance, coordination, and stamina.\n*   **Physical Discipline:** Classical Indian dance requires immense discipline, dedication, focus, and memory. These are valuable traits that can benefit a person in all aspects of life.\n*   **Mental Well-being:** Engaging in art forms can reduce stress, improve mental clarity, and provide an outlet for creative expression.\n*   **Appreciation of Art and Culture:** Islam values beauty and artistry, provided it doesn't lead to prohibited acts. Learning about and appreciating other cultures' artistic expressions can broaden one's understanding of the world.\n\n**2. Potential Challenges/Considerations (From an Islamic Perspective):**\n\n*   **Religious/Spiritual Connotations:** This is the primary concern.\n    *   **Origins:** Many classical Indian dance forms originated in temples as devotional acts (*bhakti*). They are often narratives from Hindu epics (like the Ramayana and Mahabharata) or depict stories of Hindu deities (Krishna, Shiva, Devi, etc.).\n    *   **Mudras and Abhinaya:** The hand gestures (*mudras*) and facial expressions (*abhinaya*) are often symbolic representations of deities, prayers, or specific Hindu mythological events.\n    *   **Shirk (Polytheism):** For a Muslim, actively performing movements or gestures that are intended as worship of Hindu deities or that clearly narrate stories celebrating polytheistic concepts could be problematic, as it risks compromising *Tawhid* (the oneness of God), which is the cornerstone of Islam. A Muslim must be careful not to engage in acts that could be perceived as *shirk* or participating in the religious rituals of another faith in a way that compromises their beliefs.\n\n*   **Modesty (Awra):**\n    *   **Attire:** Traditional classical Indian dance costumes can be revealing (e.g., bare midriff, form-fitting, or requiring movements that expose parts of the body considered *awra* in Islam, especially for women in front of non-mahram men).\n    *   **Movement:** Certain movements might be considered immodest or provocative in an Islamic context, especially if performed publicly.\n\n*   **Music:**\n    *   While instrumental music is generally permissible in Islam, if the accompanying songs contain lyrics or themes that contradict Islamic teachings (e.g., promoting polytheism, illicit acts), this would be problematic.\n\n*   **Gender Mixing and Performance Context:**\n    *   Public performance, especially for women in front of mixed audiences, is a concern for some Muslims, particularly if it involves immodest dress or movements.\n\n**Can a \"Good Muslim\" Learn It?**\n\nIt depends on the individual's **intention (niyyah)**, their **approach to the art form**, and their **interpretation of Islamic guidelines**.\n\nTo make it permissible for a Muslim, one would generally need to:\n\n1.  **Maintain Pure Intention:** Focus solely on the physical discipline, health benefits, artistic expression, and cultural appreciation, rather than engaging in any form of worship or reverence for Hindu deities.\n2.  **Separate Art from Religion:** Consciously disconnect from the religious narratives and devotional aspects. This might mean focusing on abstract pieces, rhythmic movements (nritta), or pieces that have been secularized.\n3.  **Ensure Modesty:** Modify or adapt the attire to comply with Islamic dress codes. For women, this would mean ensuring the body is covered modestly, and for both genders, that the movements are not immodest.\n4.  **Consider Performance Context:** If performing, choose contexts that are permissible (e.g., same-sex audiences, family, or for purely educational purposes without compromising modesty).\n5.  **Focus on Physicality:** Treat it primarily as a form of physical exercise and a demanding art form, much like gymnastics or ballet, while being mindful of its origins.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nWhile the physical and mental benefits of classical Indian dancing align with Islamic encouragement for well-being, the deep-seated religious and spiritual elements present the main challenge. A Muslim who wishes to learn this art form would need to very carefully navigate these aspects, ensure their intention remains purely for health and art, avoid any act that could be construed as *shirk* or participation in other religious rituals, and adhere to Islamic principles of modesty.\n\nSome Muslims may find it difficult to fully separate the art form from its religious roots and thus avoid it entirely, while others may feel they can extract the physical and artistic benefits while consciously disengaging from the religious narratives. Ultimately, it often comes down to individual conscience and interpretation, and consulting with a knowledgeable Islamic scholar who understands both the dance form and Islamic jurisprudence can be beneficial."}

{"Question": "Q: I have been living with a lot of hard ship for the past 4 months. I have OCD and I cant control my thoughts. The more I try to avoid bad thoughts the more they come into my head. So every time before namaz I have to wash myself and do wudu because I am not sure if I had dirty thoughts that would cause vaginal discharge and having OCD makes this worse because I can never tell the difference. So I always have to wash myself and do wudu 5 times a day. I can never keep my wudu because I cant stop dirty/bad thoughts from coming in my mind and even if they dont come, if I try to remember if I have broken my wudu or not then they come into my mind and I think my wudu is broken. I can never tell if there is discharge with the thoughts but it is getting to be very stressful. I spend so much time doing wudu my skin is getting ruined from all the water. It is so dry. I use a lot of lotion and even that is getting finished very quickly but it is still very dry. I dont know what to do. I cant control my thoughts and I can never know if my wudu has broken or not. So if I come home late from something and there is still time to pray I go and make wudu and pray but then the more I try to avoid bad thoughts the more they come and bother me. I am trying to get better but treating OCD is very hard so an hour later I have to do wudu all over again. This becomes a big problem where I have to leave somewhere right after namaz because it takes me so long to do wudu and get namaz done. It is causing me a lot of mental stress. I am so tired of doing all this. 1) What do I do in this situation? I really need advice. My parents get very upset with me for using so much water and being in the bathroom for so long but I dont know what to do. I have heard that if you are not 100% certain that your wudu has broken then you dont have to renew it but I am never sure but I feel like if I dont do wudu every time then what if my namaaz doesnt count? I dont know what to do. I am very depressed about this please help. ? --T--", "Answer": "Do not pay attention to these stray thoughts. Your wudhu will not break by the thought passing your mind. However if discharge comes out, then the wudhu will break. And Allah Taala ( ) knows best", "Document": "Narrated Aisha:(The wife of the Prophet) Whenever Allahs Apostle intended to go on a journey, he used to draw lots among his wives and would take with him the one on whom the lot had fallen. Once he drew lots when he wanted to carry out a Ghazwa, and the lot came upon me. So I proceeded with Allahs Apostle after Allahs order of veiling (the women) had been revealed and thus I was carried in my howdah (on a camel) and dismounted while still in it. We carried on our journey, and when Allahs Apostle had finished his Ghazwa and returned and we approached Medina, Allahs Apostle ordered to proceed at night. When the army was ordered to resume the homeward journey, I got up and walked on till I left the army (camp) behind. When I had answered the call of nature, I went towards my howdah, but behold ! A necklace of mine made of Jaz Azfar (a kind of black bead) was broken and I looked for it and my search for it detained me. The group of people who used to carry me, came and carried my howdah on to the back of my camel on which I was riding, considering that I was therein. At that time women were light in weight and were not fleshy for they used to eat little (food), so those people did not feel the lightness of the howdah while raising it up, and I was still a young lady. They drove away the camel and proceeded. Then I found my necklace after the army had gone. I came to their camp but found nobody therein so I went to the place where I used to stay, thinking that they would miss me and come back in my search. While I was sitting at my place, I felt sleepy and slept. Safwan bin Al-Muattil As-Sulami Adh- Dhakw-ani was behind the army. He had started in the last part of the night and reached my stationing place in the morning and saw the figure of a sleeping person. He came to me and recognized me on seeing me for he used to see me before veiling. I got up because of his saying: \"Inna Li l-lahi wa inna ilaihi rajiun,\" which he uttered on recognizing me. I covered my face with my garment, and by Allah, he did not say to me a single word except, \"Inna Li l-lahi wa inna ilaihi rajiun,\" till he made his shecamel kneel down whereupon he trod on its forelegs and I mounted it. Then Safwan set out, leading the she-camel that was carrying me, till we met the army while they were resting during the hot midday. Then whoever was meant for destruction, fell in destruction, and the leader of the Ifk (forged statement) was `Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul. After this we arrived at Medina and I became ill for one month while the people were spreading the forged statements of the people of the Ifk, and I was not aware of anything thereof. But what aroused my doubt while I was sick, was that I was no longer receiving from Allahs Apostle the same kindness as I used to receive when I fell sick. Allahs Apostle would enter upon me, say a greeting and add, \"How is that (lady)?\" and then depart. That aroused my suspicion but I was not aware of the propagated evil till I recovered from my ailment. I went out with Um Mistah to answer the call of nature towards Al-Manasi, the place where we used to relieve ourselves, and used not to go out for this purpose except from night to night, and that was before we had lavatories close to our houses. And this habit of ours was similar to the habit of the old Arabs (in the deserts or in the tents) concerning the evacuation of the bowels, for we considered it troublesome and harmful to take lavatories in the houses. So I went out with Um Mistah who was the daughter of Abi Ruhm bin `Abd Manaf, and her mother was daughter of Sakhr bin Amir who was the aunt of Abi Bakr As-Siddiq, and her son was Mistah bin Uthatha. When we had finished our affair, Um Mistah and I came back towards my house. Um Mistah stumbled over her robe whereupon she said, \"Let Mistah be ruined ! \" I said to her, \"What a bad word you have said! Do you abuse a man who has taken part in the Battle of Badr? She said, \"O you there! Didnt you hear what he has said?\" I said, \"And what did he say?\" She then told me the statement of the people of the Ifk (forged statement) which added to my ailment. When I returned home, Allahs Apostle came to me, and after greeting, he said, \"How is that (lady)?\" I said, \"Will you allow me to go to my parents?\" At that time I intended to be sure of the news through them. Allahs Apostle allowed me and I went to my parents and asked my mother, \"O my mother! What are the people talking about?\" My mother said, \"O my daughter! Take it easy, for by Allah, there is no charming lady who is loved by her husband who has other wives as well, but that those wives would find fault with her.\" I said, \"Subhan Allah! Did the people really talk about that?\" That night I kept on weeping the whole night till the morning. My tears never stopped, nor did I sleep, and morning broke while I was still weeping, Allahs Apostle called `Ali bin Abi Talib and Usama bin Zaid when the Divine Inspiration delayed, in order to consult them as to the idea of divorcing his wife. Usama bin Zaid told Allahs Apostle of what he knew about the innocence of his wife and of his affection he kept for her. He said, \"O Allahs Apostle! She is your wife, and we do not know anything about her except good.\" But `Ali bin Abi Talib said, \"O Allahs Apostle! Allah does not impose restrictions on you; and there are plenty of women other than her. If you however, ask (her) slave girl, she will tell you the truth.\" `Aisha added: So Allahs Apostle called for Barira and said, \"O Barira! Did you ever see anything which might have aroused your suspicion? (as regards Aisha). Barira said, \"By Allah Who has sent you with the truth, I have never seen anything regarding Aisha which I would blame her for except that she is a girl of immature age who sometimes sleeps and leaves the dough of her family unprotected so that the domestic goats come and eat it.\" So Allahs Apostle got up (and addressed) the people an asked for somebody who would take revenge on `Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul then. Allahs Apostle, while on the pulpit, said, \"O Muslims! Who will help me against a man who has hurt me by slandering my family? By Allah, I know nothing except good about my family, and people have blamed a man of whom I know nothing except good, and he never used to visit my family except with me,\" Sa`d bin Mu`adh Al-Ansari got up and said, \"O Allahs Apostle! By Allah, I will relieve you from him. If he be from the tribe of (Bani) Al-Aus, then I will chop his head off; and if he be from our brethren, the Khazraj, then you give us your order and we will obey it.\" On that, Sa`d bin Ubada got up, and he was the chief of the Khazraj, and before this incident he had been a pious man but he was incited by his zeal for his tribe. He said to Sa`d (bin Mu`adh), \"By Allah the Eternal, you have told a lie! You shall not kill him and you will never be able to kill him!\" On that, Usaid bin Hudair, the cousin of Sa`d (bin Mu`adh) got up and said to Sa`d bin Ubada, \"You are a liar! By Allah the Eternal, we will surely kill him; and you are a hypocrite defending the hypocrites!\" So the two tribes of Al-Aus and Al-Khazraj got excited till they were on the point of fighting with each other while Allahs Apostle was standing on the pulpit. Allahs Apostle continued quietening them till they became silent whereupon he became silent too. On that day I kept on weeping so much that neither did my tears stop, nor could I sleep. In the morning my parents were with me, and I had wept for two nights and a day without sleeping and with incessant tears till they thought that my liver would burst with weeping. While they were with me and I was weeping, an Ansari woman asked permission to see me. I admitted her and she sat and started weeping with me. While I was in that state, Allahs Apostle came to us, greeted, and sat down,. He had never sat with me since the day what was said, was said. He had stayed a month without receiving any Divine Inspiration concerning my case. Allahs Apostle recited the Tashahhud after he had sat down, and then said, \"Thereafter, O `Aisha! I have been informed such and-such a thing about you; and if you are innocent, Allah will reveal your innocence, and if you have committed a sin, then ask for Allahs forgiveness and repent to Him, for when a slave confesses his sin and then repents to Allah, Allah accepts his repentance.\" When Allahs Apostle had finished his speech, my tears ceased completely so that I no longer felt even a drop thereof. Then I said to my father, \"Reply to Allahs Apostle on my behalf as to what he said.\" He said, \"By Allah, I do not know what to say to Allahs Apostle.\" Then I said to my mother, \"Reply to Allahs Apostle.\" She said, \"I do not know what to say to Allahs Apostle.\" Still a young girl as I was and though I had little knowledge of Quran, I said, \"By Allah, I know that you heard this story (of the Ifk) so much so that it has been planted in your minds and you have believed it. So now, if I tell you that I am innocent, and Allah knows that I am innocent, you will not believe me; and if I confess something, and Allah knows that I am innocent of it, you will believe me. By Allah, I cannot find of you an example except that of Josephs father: \"So (for me) patience is most fitting against that which you assert and it is Allah (Alone) Whose help can be sought. Then I turned away and lay on my bed, and at that time I knew that I was innocent and that Allah would reveal my innocence. But by Allah, I never thought that Allah would sent down about my affair, Divine Inspiration that would be recited (forever), as I considered myself too unworthy to be talked of by Allah with something that was to be recited: but I hoped that Allahs Apostle might have a vision in which Allah would prove my innocence. By Allah, Allahs Apostle had not left his seat and nobody had left the house when the Divine Inspiration came to Allahs Apostle . So there overtook him the same hard condition which used to overtake him (when he was Divinely Inspired) so that the drops of his sweat were running down, like pearls, though it was a (cold) winter day, and that was because of the heaviness of the Statement which was revealed to him. When that state of Allahs Apostle was over, and he was smiling when he was relieved, the first word he said was, \"Aisha, Allah has declared your innocence.\" My mother said to me, \"Get up and go to him.\" I said, \"By Allah, I will not go to him and I will not thank anybody but Allah.\" So Allah revealed: \"Verily! They who spread the Slander are a gang among you. Think it not....\" (24.11-20). When Allah revealed this to confirm my innocence, Abu Bakr As-Siddiq who used to provide for Mistah bin Uthatha because of the latters kinship to him and his poverty, said, \"By Allah, I will never provide for Mistah anything after what he has said about Aisha\". So Allah revealed: (continued...) (continuing... 1): -6.274:... ... \"Let not those among you who are good and are wealthy swear not to give (help) to their kinsmen, those in need, and those who have left their homes for Allahs Cause. Let them Pardon and forgive (i.e. do not punish them). Do you not love that should forgive you? Verily Allah is Oft-forgiving. Most Merciful.\" (24.22) Abu Bakr said, \"Yes, by Allah, I wish that Allah should forgive me.\" So he resumed giving Mistah the aid he used to give him before and said, \"By Allah, I will never withold it from him at all.\" Aisha further said: Allahs Apostle also asked Zainab bint Jahsh about my case. He said, \"O Zainab! What have you seen?\" She replied, \"O Allahs Apostle! I protect my hearing and my sight (by refraining from telling lies). I know nothing but good (about Aisha).\" Of all the wives of Allahs Apostle, it was Zainab who aspired to receive from him the same favor as I used to receive, yet, Allah saved her (from telling lies) because of her piety. But her sister, Hamna, kept on fighting on her behalf so she was destroyed as were those who invented and spread the slander.<D>Narrated Aisha:(the wife of the Prophet) \"Whenever Allahs Apostle intended to go on a journey, he would draw lots amongst his wives and would take with him the one upon whom the lot fell. During a Ghazwa of his, he drew lots amongst us and the lot fell upon me, and I proceeded with him after Allah had decreed the use of the veil by women. I was carried in a Howdah (on the camel) and dismounted while still in it. When Allahs Apostle was through with his Ghazwa and returned home, and we approached the city of Medina, Allahs Apostle ordered us to proceed at night. When the order of setting off was given, I walked till I was past the army to answer the call of nature. After finishing I returned (to the camp) to depart (with the others) and suddenly realized that my necklace over my chest was missing. So, I returned to look for it and was delayed because of that. The people who used to carry me on the camel, came to my Howdah and put it on the back of the camel, thinking that I was in it, as, at that time, women were light in weight, and thin and lean, and did not use to eat much. So, those people did not feel the difference in the heaviness of the Howdah while lifting it, and they put it over the camel. At that time I was a young lady. They set the camel moving and proceeded on. I found my necklace after the army had gone, and came to their camp to find nobody. So, I went to the place where I used to stay, thinking that they would discover my absence and come back in my search. While in that state, I felt sleepy and slept. Safwan bin Muattal As-Sulami Adh-Dhakwani was behind the army and reached my abode in the morning. When he saw a sleeping person, he came to me, and he used to see me before veiling. So, I got up when I heard him saying, \"Inna lil-lah-wa inn a ilaihi rajiun (We are for Allah, and we will return to Him).\" He made his camel knell down. He got down from his camel, and put his leg on the front legs of the camel and then I rode and sat over it. Safwan set out walking, leading the camel by the rope till we reached the army who had halted to take rest at midday. Then whoever was meant for destruction, fell into destruction, (some people accused me falsely) and the leader of the false accusers was `Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul. After that we returned to Medina, and I became ill for one month while the people were spreading the forged statements of the false accusers. I was feeling during my ailment as if I were not receiving the usual kindness from the Prophet which I used to receive from him when I got sick. But he would come, greet and say, How is that (girl)? I did not know anything of what was going on till I recovered from my ailment and went out with Um Mistah to the Manasi where we used to answer the call of nature, and we used not to go to answer the call of nature except from night to night and that was before we had lavatories near to our houses. And this habit of ours was similar to the habit of the old Arabs in the open country (or away from houses). So. I and Um Mistah bint Ruhm went out walking. Um Mistah stumbled because of her long dress and on that she said, Let Mistah be ruined. I said, You are saying a bad word. Why are you abusing a man who took part in (the battle of) Badr? She said, O Hanata (you there) didnt you hear what they said? Then she told me the rumors of the false accusers. My sickness was aggravated, and when I returned home, Allahs Apostle came to me, and after greeting he said, How is that (girl)? I requested him to allow me to go to my parents. I wanted then to be sure of the news through them I Allahs Apostle allowed me, and I went to my parents and asked my mother, What are the people talking about? She said, O my daughter! Dont worry much about this matter. By Allah, never is there a charming woman loved by her husband who has other wives, but the women would forge false news about her. I said, Glorified be Allah! Are the people really taking of this matter? That night I kept on weeping and could not sleep till morning. In the morning Allahs Apostle called `Ali bin Abu Talib and Usama bin Zaid when he saw the Divine Inspiration delayed, to consul them about divorcing his wife (i.e. `Aisha). Usama bin Zaid said what he knew of the good reputation of his wives and added, O Allahs Apostle! Keep you wife, for, by Allah, we know nothing about her but good. `Ali bin Abu Talib said, O Allahs Apostle! Allah has no imposed restrictions on you, and there are many women other than she, yet you may ask the woman-servant who will tell you the truth. On that Allahs Apostle called Buraira and said, O Burair. Did you ever see anything which roused your suspicions about her? Buraira said, No, by Allah Who has sent you with the Truth, I have never seen in her anything faulty except that she is a girl of immature age, who sometimes sleeps and leaves the dough for the goats to eat. On that day Allahs Apostle ascended the pulpit and requested that somebody support him in punishing `Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul. Allahs Apostle said, Who will support me to punish that person (`Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul) who has hurt me by slandering the reputation of my family? By Allah, I know nothing about my family but good, and they have accused a person about whom I know nothing except good, and he never entered my house except in my company. Sa`d bin Mu`adh got up and said, O Allahs Apostle! by Allah, I will relieve you from him. If that man is from the tribe of the Aus, then we will chop his head off, and if he is from our brothers, the Khazraj, then order us, and we will fulfill your order. On that Sa`d bin Ubada, the chief of the Khazraj and before this incident, he had been a pious man, got up, motivated by his zeal for his tribe and said, By Allah, you have told a lie; you cannot kill him, and you will never be able to kill him. On that Usaid bin Al-Hadir got up and said (to Sa`d bin Ubada), By Allah! you are a liar. By Allah, we will kill him; and you are a hypocrite, defending the hypocrites. On this the two tribes of Aus and Khazraj got excited and were about to fight each other, while Allahs Apostle was standing on the pulpit. He got down and quieted them till they became silent and he kept quiet. On that day I kept on weeping so much so that neither did my tears stop, nor could I sleep. In the morning my parents were with me and I had wept for two nights and a day, till I thought my liver would burst from weeping. While they were sitting with me and I was weeping, an Ansari woman asked my permission to enter, and I allowed her to come in. She sat down and started weeping with me. While we were in this state, Allahs Apostle came and sat down and he had never sat with me since the day they forged the accusation. No revelation regarding my case came to him for a month. He recited Tashah-hud (i.e. None has the right to be worshipped but Allah and Muhammad is His Apostle) and then said, O `Aisha! I have been informed such-and-such about you; if you are innocent, then Allah will soon reveal your innocence, and if you have committed a sin, then repent to Allah and ask Him to forgive you, for when a person confesses his sin and asks Allah for forgiveness, Allah accepts his repentance. When Allahs Apostle finished his speech my tears ceased completely and there remained not even a single drop of it. I requested my father to reply to Allahs Apostle on my behalf. My father said, By Allah, I do not know what to say to Allahs Apostle. I said to my mother, Talk to Allahs Apostle on my behalf. She said, By Allah, I do not know what to say to Allahs Apostle. I was a young girl and did not have much knowledge of the Quran. I said. I know, by Allah, that you have listened to what people are saying and that has been planted in your minds and you have taken it as a truth. Now, if I told you that I am innocent and Allah knows that I am innocent, you would not believe me and if I confessed to you falsely that I am guilty, and Allah knows that I am innocent you would believe me. By Allah, I dont compare my situation with you except to the situation of Josephs father (i.e. Jacob) who said, So (for me) patience is most fitting against that which you assert and it is Allah (Alone) whose help can be sought. Then I turned to the other side of my bed hoping that Allah would prove my innocence. By Allah I never thought that Allah would reveal Divine Inspiration in my case, as I considered myself too inferior to be talked of in the Holy Quran. I had hoped that Allahs Apostle might have a dream in which Allah would prove my innocence. By Allah, Allahs Apostle had not got up and nobody had left the house before the Divine Inspiration came to Allahs Apostle. So, there overtook him the same state which used to overtake him, (when he used to have, on being inspired divinely). He was sweating so much so that the drops of the sweat were dropping like pearls though it was a (cold) wintry day. When that state of Allahs Apostle was over, he was smiling and the first word he said, `Aisha! Thank Allah, for Allah has declared your innocence. My mother told me to go to Allahs Apostle . I replied, By Allah I will not go to him and will not thank but Allah. So Allah revealed: \"Verily! They who spread the slander are a gang among you . . .\" (24.11) When Allah gave the declaration of my Innocence, Abu Bakr, who used to provide for Mistah bin Uthatha for he was his relative, said, By Allah, I will never provide Mistah with anything because of what he said about Aisha. But Allah later revealed: -- \"And let not those who are good and wealthy among you swear not to help their kinsmen, those in need and those who left their homes in Allahs Cause. Let them forgive and overlook. Do you not wish that Allah should forgive you? Verily! Allah is Oft-forgiving, Most Merciful.\" (24.22) After that Abu Bakr said, Yes ! By Allah! I like that Allah should forgive me, and resumed helping Mistah whom he used to help before. Allahs Apostle also asked Zainab bint Jahsh (i.e. the Prophets wife about me saying, What do you know and what did you see? She replied, O Allahs Apostle! I refrain to claim hearing or seeing what I have not heard or seen. By Allah, I know nothing except goodness about Aisha.\" Aisha further added \"Zainab was competing with me (in her beauty and the Prophets love), yet Allah protected her (from being malicious), for she had piety.\"<D>Anas bin Malik narrated that :the Messenger of Allah said: The acceptable Wudu is with two Ratils of water.\"<D>(For they, if they) the Magians (should come to know of you, will stone you) kill you (or turn you back to their religion) Zoroastrianism; (then ye will never prosper) you will never escape from Allahs punishment.<D>(That ye serve none) you confess the divine Oneness of none, (save Allah. Lo! I fear for you) I know that there shall come upon you if you do not believe (the retribution of a painful Day) which is drowning.<D>(But he was not long in coming, and he said: I have found out (a thing) that thou apprehendest not) O king! I reached a place that you have not reached and have come to know that which you do not, (and I come unto thee from Sheba) the city of Sheba (with sure tidings) with an amazing, true information.", "Generated_Answer": "I understand how incredibly difficult and distressing this situation is for you. Living with OCD, especially when it targets your worship, can feel like an unbearable burden. Please know that what you are experiencing is a common struggle for those with OCD, and there is light at the end of the tunnel, both through Islamic guidance and professional treatment.\n\nLet's break down your situation from an Islamic perspective, keeping in mind the principles of ease and mercy in our beautiful deen, especially for those suffering from *waswasah* (whispers/doubts, which is what OCD often manifests as).\n\n**1. The Islamic Ruling on Doubt and Wudu (Taharah):**\n\nThis is the most crucial point for you. Islam has a clear principle: **Certainty is not removed by doubt.**\n\n*   **If you are certain you had Wudu, and then you *doubt* whether it broke, your Wudu is still valid.** You do not need to renew it.\n*   You only need to renew your Wudu if you are **100% certain** that something specific occurred that definitively breaks Wudu (e.g., passing wind, urinating, defecating, deep sleep, sexual discharge).\n*   **Thoughts alone, no matter how \"dirty\" or \"bad,\" do NOT break Wudu.** This is a trick from Shaytan and a symptom of your OCD. Vaginal discharge caused solely by thoughts is not a valid concern for breaking Wudu. Normal vaginal discharge/moisture does not break Wudu unless it is *madhy* (pre-seminal fluid from arousal) or *maniy* (semen from orgasm). These are physical discharges, not just thoughts.\n*   **You do not need to \"feel\" or \"know\" if discharge occurred due to a thought.** This is an impossible standard and is what your OCD is forcing upon you.\n*   **The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) taught us to ignore such doubts.** There's a famous Hadith where a man complained about feeling something during prayer. The Prophet said: \"He should not leave (the prayer) unless he hears a sound or perceives a smell.\" (Bukhari, Muslim). This means you must have *certainty* of breaking Wudu, not just a feeling or doubt.\n\n**Your situation regarding Wudu:**\n\nBased on the above, your Wudu is almost certainly valid most of the time.\n\n*   When you make Wudu, consider yourself pure and with valid Wudu.\n*   **Do not check for discharge.**\n*   **Do not re-do Wudu due to thoughts.**\n*   **Do not re-do Wudu because you \"feel like\" it might have broken due to a thought or a vague sensation.**\n\n**2. Addressing Your OCD and Washing/Wudu Repetition:**\n\nWhat you are doing right now (washing 5 times a day, long Wudu, repeating Wudu due to thoughts) is actually *feeding* your OCD. Every time you give in to the compulsion, you are reinforcing the idea that the obsession (bad thoughts leading to broken Wudu/impurity) is true and needs to be addressed. This makes the cycle stronger.\n\n**What you need to do, according to Islamic principles and effective OCD management, is to IGNORE the thoughts and resist the compulsions.**\n\n*   **For Wudu:**\n    *   Make Wudu once, properly, and then **assume it is valid until you are absolutely, unequivocally certain (not just a feeling or thought) that you broke it.**\n    *   Do not spend excessive time washing. Do it normally, as a person without OCD would.\n    *   When a \"dirty thought\" comes, acknowledge it as an OCD thought, say \"A'udhu billahi minash shaytanir rajim\" (I seek refuge in Allah from the accursed Shaytan), and then immediately **ignore it**. Do not engage with it, do not try to analyze it, do not try to suppress it (as that makes it worse). Just let it pass like a cloud.\n    *   **Do not repeat your Wudu if a thought occurs.** Your Wudu is still valid.\n    *   **Do not check for discharge after a thought.** Your Wudu is still valid.\n\n*   **For Prayer (Namaz):**\n    *   Once you have made Wudu (once, quickly, and properly), go directly to pray.\n    *   If doubts come during prayer, **ignore them**. Focus on your prayer. Do not repeat your prayer.\n    *   Praying on time is very important. Your current routine is making you late, which causes more stress. By following the correct approach, you will be able to pray on time and with ease.\n\n**3. Seeking Professional Help (Crucial for OCD):**\n\nPlease understand that OCD is a medical condition. Just as you would seek help for a broken bone or a chronic illness, you must seek professional help for OCD.\n\n*   **Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) with Exposure and Response Prevention (ERP)** is the gold standard for OCD treatment. A therapist specializing in OCD will guide you through gradually confronting your fears (exposure) and, crucially, **preventing you from performing the compulsions** (like excessive washing and re-doing Wudu). This will train your brain to realize that the feared outcomes do not occur even without the rituals.\n*   **Medication** may also be an option alongside therapy, especially for severe cases.\n*   **How this relates to Islam:** Seeking knowledge and healing is encouraged in Islam. The Prophet (PBUH) said, \"For every disease there is a cure.\" Getting professional help is a step towards recovering your health and peace of mind, which will, in turn, make your worship easier and more enjoyable.\n\n**Summary of Action Plan:**\n\n1.  **Change Your Understanding of Wudu:** Your Wudu is valid unless you are *certain* it broke due to a physical event that breaks Wudu. Thoughts do not break Wudu. Vaginal discharge does not occur just because of a thought in a way that breaks Wudu.\n2.  **Make Wudu Once:** Do it normally, don't spend too long. Once done, consider it valid.\n3.  **Ignore the Doubts/Thoughts:** This is key. When a \"bad thought\" or a doubt about Wudu comes:\n    *   Say \"A'udhu billahi minash shaytanir rajim.\"\n    *   Remind yourself: \"This is my OCD/waswasah, thoughts do not break Wudu.\"\n    *   **Do not re-do Wudu.**\n    *   **Do not check for discharge.**\n    *   **Do not repeat prayer.**\n    *   Carry on with your prayer or daily activities. The more you resist the compulsion, the weaker the OCD will become.\n4.  **Communicate with Your Parents:** Explain that you are suffering from a recognized medical condition (OCD) and that part of your treatment, and the correct Islamic ruling, is to *reduce* washing and time in the bathroom, not increase it. Show them this advice if you feel comfortable.\n5.  **Seek Professional Help Immediately:** Look for a therapist specializing in OCD (CBT/ERP). This is not optional; it's essential for your recovery.\n6.  **Make Du'a:** Continue to pray to Allah for ease, healing, and strength. He knows your suffering and will help you. Recite \"La hawla wa la quwwata illa billah\" (There is no power or might except with Allah) frequently.\n\nYou are not alone in this, and you can overcome it. Your prayer is valid, your Wudu is valid. Allah is All-Merciful and does not burden a soul beyond its capacity. He wants ease for you, not hardship. By following these steps, you will be aligning your actions with both sound Islamic principles and effective medical treatment for your condition. May Allah grant you complete healing and ease your affairs."}
