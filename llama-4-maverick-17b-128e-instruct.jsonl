{"Question": "Q: A member of my family ordered a pizza from a takeaway which I do not trust as there is a rumour that the chicken could be dodgy, anyway one of the pizza slices touched my home cooked food which I was eating so my question is will this make my food haraam because I ate the roti which the slice touched. ? --T--", "Answer": "It will not be haraam. And Allah Taala ( ) knows best", "Document": "Narrated Wahab bin Kaisan:Jabir bin `Abdullah said, \"Allahs Apostle sent troops to the sea coast and appointed Abu Ubaida bin Al-Jarrah as their commander, and they were 300 (men). We set out, and we had covered some distance on the way, when our journey food ran short. So Abu Ubaida ordered that all the food present with the troops be collected, and it was collected. Our journey food was dates, and Abu Ubaida kept on giving us our daily ration from it little by little (piecemeal) till it decreased to such an extent that we did not receive except a date each.\" I asked (Jabir), \"How could one date benefit you?\" He said, \"We came to know its value when even that finished.\" Jabir added, \"Then we reached the sea (coast) where we found a fish like a small mountain. The people (i.e. troops) ate of it for 18 nights (i.e. days). Then Abu Ubaida ordered that two of its ribs be fixed on the ground (in the form of an arch) and that a she-camel be ridden and passed under them. So it passed under them without touching them.\"<D>Narrated Jabir bin `Abdullah:\"Allahs Apostle sent an army towards the east coast and appointed Abu Ubaida bin Al-Jarrah as their chief, and the army consisted of three-hundred men including myself. We marched on till we reached a place where our food was about to finish. Abu- Ubaida ordered us to collect all the journey food and it was collected. My (our) journey food was dates. Abu Ubaida kept on giving us our daily ration in small amounts from it, till it was exhausted. The share of everyone of us used to be one date only.\" I said, \"How could one date benefit you?\" Jabir replied, \"We came to know its value when even that too finished.\" Jabir added, \"When we reached the sea-shore, we saw a huge fish which was like a small mountain. The army ate from it for eighteen days. Then Abu Ubaida ordered that two of its ribs be fixed and they were fixed in the ground. Then he ordered that a she-camel be ridden and it passed under the two ribs (forming an arch) without touching them.\"<D>Narrated Ikrash bin Dhuaib:\"Banu Murrah bin Ubaid sent me to bring the Sadaqah from their wealth of the Messenger of Allah (). I arrived with him in Al-Madinah and found him sitting between the Muhajirin and the Ansar.\" He said: \"Then he took my hand and brought me to the home of Umm Salamah and he said: Do you have any food? So a bowl containing a lot of Tharid with pieces of meat was brought to us, and presented for us to eat from it. So I began wandering my around it while the Messenger of Allah () ate from what was in front of him. He grabbed my right hand with his left hand, then he said: O Ikrash! Eat from one spot, for indeed the food is one. Then a plate containing various dried dates\" - or fresh dates - Ubaidullah (a narrator) was not sure. He said: \"I began eating what was in front of me, while the hand of the Messenger of Allah () roamed about the plate. He said: O Ikrash! Eat from wherever you like, for indeed it is not all from the same variety. Then water was brought, so the Messenger of Allah () washed his hands, and with the wetness of his hands he wiped his face, his forearms, and his head, and he said: O Ikrash!

", "Generated_Answer": "To address your concern, let's break down the key elements involved in determining whether your home-cooked food becomes haram (forbidden) due to coming into contact with a potentially haram pizza slice.\n\n1. **Understanding Haram**: First, it's crucial to understand what makes food haram. In Islamic dietary laws, haram foods are those that are forbidden. This includes pork and its by-products, animals that have died of natural causes or been strangled, animals not slaughtered according to Islamic guidelines, and certain other animals or substances.\n\n2. **The Status of the Pizza's Chicken**: The concern here is that the chicken on the pizza might not have been halal (permissible). If the chicken was not slaughtered according to Islamic guidelines, it would be considered haram.\n\n3. **Cross-Contamination**: You've mentioned that one of the pizza slices came into contact with your home-cooked food. The question is whether this contact renders your food haram.\n\nIslamic jurisprudence generally considers the concept of cross-contamination in the context of whether the haram substance has significantly affected the halal food. There are different opinions among scholars on this matter, but a common consideration is the quantity of the haram substance transferred and whether it alters the taste, smell, or character of the halal food.\n\n4. **Analysis**:\n   - **Minor Contact**: If the contact was minor and did not result in a significant transfer of the potentially haram substance (e.g., just a light touch without any substance transferring), many scholars would consider the home-cooked food to remain halal.\n   - **Transfer of Substance**: If the pizza slice left behind a substance (like sauce or cheese that had come into contact with the potentially haram chicken) on your home-cooked food, the ruling might differ. Some scholars might argue that if the amount transferred is negligible and doesn't change the nature of your food, it remains halal.\n\n5. **Precaution**: In cases of doubt, Islamic teachings often encourage taking the path of caution. If you're genuinely concerned that the chicken on the pizza was not halal and that it contaminated your food, you might choose to err on the side of caution and avoid consuming the potentially contaminated food.\n\n6. **Scholarly Opinions**: Different Islamic schools of thought and scholars may have varying opinions on this matter. Some might be more stringent, while others more lenient. It might be helpful to consult with a local scholar or imam for a more specific guidance based on your circumstances."}
{"Question": "When you do ghusl and you have to make sure all your hair or skin is wet, does this mean that you have to maintain its wetness till the end of the ghusl? ? --T--", "Answer": "Assalamu alaykum Yes, one must indeed wash all of the hairs on ones body to the roots. One should be sure to avoid misgivings (waswasa) regarding this. Please look up baseless misgivings and doubts in the SunniPath archives (at www.SunniPath.com) in this regard. One is not obliged to perform the ritual bath (ghusl) in one sitting. The ghusl is valid as long as the entirety of ones body is washed, regardless of whether the whole body is wet by the end or whether some parts are dry and others wet. It is however a confirmed sunna to perform it from beginning to end without an unnecessarily prolonged delay", "Document": "It was narrated that Aishah said:\"When the Messenger of Allah () performed Ghusl from Janabah, he would wash his hands, then perform Wudu as for prayer, then he would perform Ghusl, then run his fingers through his hair to be sure that the water pour water over his head three times, then wash the rest of his body.\"<D>Narrated Abu Huraira:The Prophet (or Abul Qasim) said, \"While a man was walking, clad in a two-piece garment and proud of himself with his hair well-combed, suddenly Allah made him sink into the earth and he will go on sinking into it till the Day of Resurrection.<D>Narrated Hisham bin `Urwa:(on the authority of his father) `Aisha said, \"Whenever Allahs Apostle took the bath of Janaba, he cleaned his hands and performed ablution like that for prayer and then took a bath and rubbed his hair, till he felt that the whole skin of the head had become wet, then he would pour water thrice and wash the rest of the body.\" `Aisha further said, \"I and Allahs Apostle used to take a bath from a single water container, from which we took water simultaneously.\"<D>(Or (bethink thee) the like of him who, passing by a township) He says: do you not know about Uzayr Ibn Shurahya who passed by the township of Dayr Hiraql (which had fallen into utter ruin, exclaimed: How shall Allah give this township life after its death) How can Allah bring the people of this township back to life after their death? (So Allah made him die) right on the spot (a hundred years, then brought him back to life) at the end of the day. (He) Allah (said: How long hast thou tarried) O Uzayr? (He said: I have tarried for aday) and then looked at the sun still in the horizon and said (or part of a day. He) Allah (said: Nay, but thouhast tarried) you were dead (for a hundred years. Just look at thy food) figs and grapes (and drink) juice(which have not rotted! Look at thine ass!) look at the bones of your ass how white they look! (And, thatWe may make thee a token) a sign (to mankind) regarding the matter of bringing the dead to life, that they will be resurrected in the same state they died in, because Uzayr died young and was brought back to life as a young person. It is said that Allah made him a lesson for people, for he died when he was 40 years old and was brought back to life when his son was 120 years old, (look at the bones) the bones of your ass, (how We adjust them and then cover them with flesh!) after this. He then said: We will make grow on it nerves and veins, flesh, skin and hair and put the spirit in it. (And when (the matter) became clear untohim) how Allah gathers the bones, (he said: I know) I had known (that Allah is Able to do all things) of lifeand death. <D>(And the cattle) i.e. the camels (hath He created, whence ye have warm clothing) made of their skin (and uses) you drink their milk and use them as a means of transport, (and whereof ye eat) and you eat their meat.<D>(On honoured leaves) He says: the Quran is written on scrolls made of skin which are honoured in the sight of Allah", "Generated_Answer": "No, it is not required to maintain the wetness of the hair or skin till the end of the ghusl. What is necessary is that the water reaches all parts of the body, including the hair, during the ghusl. The key is to ensure that water reaches every part of the body at least once during the ghusl. \n\nThe process involves washing the private parts, then the rest of the body, making sure that water touches every area. If water reaches all parts of the body and the hair, and then some parts dry out during the completion of the ghusl, it is still considered valid.\n\nThe condition is met as long as the initial application of water is done properly, and there's no need to keep those areas wet throughout the entire ghusl. So, the requirement is about ensuring that water initially reaches all parts, not about maintaining the wetness throughout."}
{"Question": "I am currently working as an Assistant Manager in a cinema. Im finding it very hard to protect my Islam and good character in this job. There is free mixing, alcohol is sold, I am frequently locked in a room with a women  during end of day cash reconciliation and the hours (shift work) make it very hard for me to pray. The reason I took this job was so that my parents could stop working. Al-Hamdo- Lillah I was able to take the burden of work off my Dad. Prior to my getting this job his health had been deteriorating rapidly  he has high blood pressure (he was a bus driver). Soon he will go to Pakistan and stay there for a while  something which I hope will be better for his health and his Islam. At my current cinema I am treated very badly by my boss. However I will soon move to another cinema where Im hoping it will be easier for me to protect myself  most cinemas have a majority of male supervisors and my boss may be more lenient. However there will still be alcohol and the hours will still be long. I currently pray at work  this is very difficult as I have to be available all the time throughout my shift. Things will be easier if I stop doing this and read Kaza when I get home  something which my family are putting pressure on me about. Is there any way I can justify doing this? I dont want to leave because then my Dad will have to start work again in which case his Islam and his health will suffer. Is it ok if I stay in this job until I find a new one  bearing in mind the economic situation and the fact that while working I dont have much time for job seeking. Also it is very difficult to find a truly Halal job in a non-Muslim country  I may be unemployed for years if I leave. Im feeling very trapped ? --T--", "Answer": "Assalamu alaykum, Dear brother, You have to understand that Allah MOST HIGH is the provider and sustainer. Engaging in haram activities to earn rizq deprives that rizq of barakah. You must try to find a new job immediately. Serving alcohol, or being associated with it in any way is haraam. According to a hadith, all of the people associate with alcohol are cursed by Allah MOST HIGH.Narrated Jabir bin Abdullah: I heard Allahs Messenger, in the year of the Conquest of Mecca, saying, Allah and His Messenger made illegal the trade of alcohol, dead animals, pigs and idols. The people asked, O Allahs Messenger! What about the fat of dead animals, for it was used for greasing the boats and the hides; and people use it for lights? He said, No, it is illegal. Allahs Messenger further said, May Allah curse the Jews, for Allah made the fat (of animals) illegal for them, yet they melted the fat and sold it and ate its price.Ibn Abbas (Allah be pleased with him) reported: This news reached Umar that Samura had sold wine, whereupon he said: May Allah destroy Samura; does he not know that Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: Let there be the curse of Allah upon the Jews that fat was declared forbidden for them, but they melted it and then sold it?>From the way that you write, it seems that you are from England. I do know that in England there is a very good social security system that helps unemployed people. If this is not the case, continue to work there until you find more work, then leave the job.

Completed memorization of Quran at 16, then went on to complete the alim course. All education was conducted in the UK, at the Institute of Islamic Education, Dewsbury. Studies totalled 12 years.After graduating in 1994, was imam in Manchester, England, for one year. Then I moved to the USA, and have been an imam at various Islamic Centers.Currently Imam and teacher at the Islamic Community of Tampa Bay, Florida", "Document": "Narrated Aisha:(the wife of the Prophet) \"Whenever Allahs Apostle intended to go on a journey, he would draw lots amongst his wives and would take with him the one upon whom the lot fell. During a Ghazwa of his, he drew lots amongst us and the lot fell upon me, and I proceeded with him after Allah had decreed the use of the veil by women. I was carried in a Howdah (on the camel) and dismounted while still in it. When Allahs Apostle was through with his Ghazwa and returned home, and we approached the city of Medina, Allahs Apostle ordered us to proceed at night. When the order of setting off was given, I walked till I was past the army to answer the call of nature. After finishing I returned (to the camp) to depart (with the others) and suddenly realized that my necklace over my chest was missing. So, I returned to look for it and was delayed because of that. The people who used to carry me on the camel, came to my Howdah and put it on the back of the camel, thinking that I was in it, as, at that time, women were light in weight, and thin and lean, and did not use to eat much. So, those people did not feel the difference in the heaviness of the Howdah while lifting it, and they put it over the camel. At that time I was a young lady. They set the camel moving and proceeded on. I found my necklace after the army had gone, and came to their camp to find nobody. So, I went to the place where I used to stay, thinking that they would discover my absence and come back in my search. While in that state, I felt sleepy and slept. Safwan bin Muattal As-Sulami Adh-Dhakwani was behind the army and reached my abode in the morning. When he saw a sleeping person, he came to me, and he used to see me before veiling. So, I got up when I heard him saying, \"Inna lil-lah-wa inn a ilaihi rajiun (We are for Allah, and we will return to Him).\" He made his camel knell down. He got down from his camel, and put his leg on the front legs of the camel and then I rode and sat over it. Safwan set out walking, leading the camel by the rope till we reached the army who had halted to take rest at midday. Then whoever was meant for destruction, fell into destruction, (some people accused me falsely) and the leader of the false accusers was `Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul. After that we returned to Medina, and I became ill for one month while the people were spreading the forged statements of the false accusers. I was feeling during my ailment as if I were not receiving the usual kindness from the Prophet which I used to receive from him when I got sick. But he would come, greet and say, How is that (girl)? I did not know anything of what was going on till I recovered from my ailment and went out with Um Mistah to the Manasi where we used to answer the call of nature, and we used not to go to answer the call of nature except from night to night and that was before we had lavatories near to our houses. And this habit of ours was similar to the habit of the old Arabs in the open country (or away from houses). So. I and Um Mistah bint Ruhm went out walking. Um Mistah stumbled because of her long dress and on that she said, Let Mistah be ruined. I said, You are saying a bad word. Why are you abusing a man who took part in (the battle of) Badr? She said, O Hanata (you there) didnt you hear what they said? Then she told me the rumors of the false accusers. My sickness was aggravated, and when I returned home, Allahs Apostle came to me, and after greeting he said, How is that (girl)? I requested him to allow me to go to my parents. I wanted then to be sure of the news through them I Allahs Apostle allowed me, and I went to my parents and asked my mother, What are the people talking about? She said, O my daughter! Dont worry much about this matter. By Allah, never is there a charming woman loved by her husband who has other wives, but the women would forge false news about her. I said, Glorified be Allah! Are the people really taking of this matter? That night I kept on weeping and could not sleep till morning. In the morning Allahs Apostle called `Ali bin Abu Talib and Usama bin Zaid when he saw the Divine Inspiration delayed, to consul them about divorcing his wife (i.e. `Aisha). Usama bin Zaid said what he knew of the good reputation of his wives and added, O Allahs Apostle! Keep you wife, for, by Allah, we know nothing about her but good. `Ali bin Abu Talib said, O Allahs Apostle! Allah has no imposed restrictions on you, and there are many women other than she, yet you may ask the woman-servant who will tell you the truth. On that Allahs Apostle called Buraira and said, O Burair. Did you ever see anything which roused your suspicions about her? Buraira said, No, by Allah Who has sent you with the Truth, I have never seen in her anything faulty except that she is a girl of immature age, who sometimes sleeps and leaves the dough for the goats to eat. On that day Allahs Apostle ascended the pulpit and requested that somebody support him in punishing `Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul. Allahs Apostle said, Who will support me to punish that person (`Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul) who has hurt me by slandering the reputation of my family? By Allah, I know nothing about my family but good, and they have accused a person about whom I know nothing except good, and he never entered my house except in my company. Sa`d bin Mu`adh got up and said, O Allahs Apostle! by Allah, I will relieve you from him. If that man is from the tribe of the Aus, then we will chop his head off, and if he is from our brothers, the Khazraj, then order us, and we will fulfill your order. On that Sa`d bin Ubada, the chief of the Khazraj and before this incident, he had been a pious man, got up, motivated by his zeal for his tribe and said, By Allah, you have told a lie; you cannot kill him, and you will never be able to kill him. On that Usaid bin Al-Hadir got up and said (to Sa`d bin Ubada), By Allah! you are a liar. By Allah, we will kill him; and you are a hypocrite, defending the hypocrites. On this the two tribes of Aus and Khazraj got excited and were about to fight each other, while Allahs Apostle was standing on the pulpit. He got down and quieted them till they became silent and he kept quiet. On that day I kept on weeping so much so that neither did my tears stop, nor could I sleep. In the morning my parents were with me and I had wept for two nights and a day, till I thought my liver would burst from weeping. While they were sitting with me and I was weeping, an Ansari woman asked my permission to enter, and I allowed her to come in. She sat down and started weeping with me. While we were in this state, Allahs Apostle came and sat down and he had never sat with me since the day they forged the accusation. No revelation regarding my case came to him for a month. He recited Tashah-hud (i.e. None has the right to be worshipped but Allah and Muhammad is His Apostle) and then said, O `Aisha! I have been informed such-and-such about you; if you are innocent, then Allah will soon reveal your innocence, and if you have committed a sin, then repent to Allah and ask Him to forgive you, for when a person confesses his sin and asks Allah for forgiveness, Allah accepts his repentance. When Allahs Apostle finished his speech my tears ceased completely and there remained not even a single drop of it. I requested my father to reply to Allahs Apostle on my behalf. My father said, By Allah, I do not know what to say to Allahs Apostle. I said to my mother, Talk to Allahs Apostle on my behalf. She said, By Allah, I do not know what to say to Allahs Apostle. I was a young girl and did not have much knowledge of the Quran. I said. I know, by Allah, that you have listened to what people are saying and that has been planted in your minds and you have taken it as a truth. Now, if I told you that I am innocent and Allah knows that I am innocent, you would not believe me and if I confessed to you falsely that I am guilty, and Allah knows that I am innocent you would believe me. By Allah, I dont compare my situation with you except to the situation of Josephs father (i.e. Jacob) who said, So (for me) patience is most fitting against that which you assert and it is Allah (Alone) whose help can be sought. Then I turned to the other side of my bed hoping that Allah would prove my innocence. By Allah I never thought that Allah would reveal Divine Inspiration in my case, as I considered myself too inferior to be talked of in the Holy Quran. I had hoped that Allahs Apostle might have a dream in which Allah would prove my innocence. By Allah, Allahs Apostle had not got up and nobody had left the house before the Divine Inspiration came to Allahs Apostle. So, there overtook him the same state which used to overtake him, (when he used to have, on being inspired divinely). He was sweating so much so that the drops of the sweat were dropping like pearls though it was a (cold) wintry day. When that state of Allahs Apostle was over, he was smiling and the first word he said, `Aisha! Thank Allah, for Allah has declared your innocence. My mother told me to go to Allahs Apostle . I replied, By Allah I will not go to him and will not thank but Allah. So Allah revealed: \"Verily! They who spread the slander are a gang among you . . .\" (24.11) When Allah gave the declaration of my Innocence, Abu Bakr, who used to provide for Mistah bin Uthatha for he was his relative, said, By Allah, I will never provide Mistah with anything because of what he said about Aisha. But Allah later revealed: -- \"And let not those who are good and wealthy among you swear not to help their kinsmen, those in need and those who left their homes in Allahs Cause. Let them forgive and overlook. Do you not wish that Allah should forgive you? Verily! Allah is Oft-forgiving, Most Merciful.\" (24.22) After that Abu Bakr said, Yes ! By Allah! I like that Allah should forgive me, and resumed helping Mistah whom he used to help before. Allahs Apostle also asked Zainab bint Jahsh (i.e. the Prophets wife about me saying, What do you know and what did you see? She replied, O Allahs Apostle! I refrain to claim hearing or seeing what I have not heard or seen. By Allah, I know nothing except goodness about Aisha.\" Aisha further added \"Zainab was competing with me (in her beauty and the Prophets love), yet Allah protected her (from being malicious), for she had piety.\"<D>Narrated Sa`id bin Jubair:I said to Ibn `Abbas, \"Nauf Al-Bukah claims that Moses, the companion of Al-Khadir was not Moses (the prophet) of the children of Israel, but some other Moses.\" Ibn `Abbas said, \"Allahs enemy (i.e. Nauf) has told a lie. Ubai bin Ka`b told us that the Prophet said, Once Moses stood up and addressed Bani Israel. He was asked who was the most learned man amongst the people. He said, I. Allah admonished him as he did not attribute absolute knowledge to Him (Allah). So, Allah said to him, Yes, at the junction of the two seas there is a Slave of Mine who is more learned than you. Moses said, O my Lord! How can I meet him? Allah said, Take a fish and put it in a large basket and you will find him at the place where you will lose the fish. Moses took a fish and put it in a basket and proceeded along with his (servant) boy, Yusha` bin Noon, till they reached the rock where they laid their heads (i.e. lay down). Moses slept, and the fish, moving out of the basket, fell into the sea. It took its way into the sea (straight) as in a tunnel. Allah stopped the flow of water over the fish and it became like an arch (the Prophet pointed out this arch with his hands). They travelled the rest of the night, and the next day Moses said to his boy (servant), Give us our food, for indeed, we have suffered much fatigue in this journey of ours. Moses did not feel tired till he crossed that place which Allah had ordered him to seek after. His boy (servant) said to him, Do you know that when we were sitting near that rock, I forgot the fish, and none but Satan caused me to forget to tell (you) about it, and it took its course into the sea in an amazing way?. So there was a path for the fish and that astonished them. Moses said, That was what we were seeking after. So, both of them retraced their footsteps till they reached the rock. There they saw a man Lying covered with a garment. Moses greeted him and he replied saying, How do people greet each other in your land? Moses said, I am Moses. The man asked, Moses of Bani Israel? Moses said, Yes, I have come to you so that you may teach me from those things which Allah has taught you. He said, O Moses! I have some of the Knowledge of Allah which Allah has taught me, and which you do not know, while you have some of the Knowledge of Allah which Allah has taught you and which I do not know. Moses asked, May I follow you? He said, But you will not be able to remain patient with me for how can you be patient about things which you will not be able to understand? (Moses said, You will find me, if Allah so will, truly patient, and I will not disobey you in aught.) So, both of them set out walking along the sea-shore, a boat passed by them and they asked the crew of the boat to take them on board. The crew recognized Al-Khadir and so they took them on board without fare. When they were on board the boat, a sparrow came and stood on the edge of the boat and dipped its beak once or twice into the sea. Al-Khadir said to Moses, O Moses! My knowledge and your knowledge have not decreased Allahs Knowledge except as much as this sparrow has decreased the water of the sea with its beak. Then suddenly Al-Khadir took an adze and plucked a plank, and Moses did not notice it till he had plucked a plank with the adze. Moses said to him, What have you done? They took us on board charging us nothing; yet you I have intentionally made a hole in their boat so as to drown its passengers. Verily, you have done a dreadful thing. Al-Khadir replied, Did I not tell you that you would not be able to remain patient with me? Moses replied, Do not blame me for what I have forgotten, and do not be hard upon me for my fault. So the first excuse of Moses was that he had forgotten. When they had left the sea, they passed by a boy playing with other boys. Al-Khadir took hold of the boys head and plucked it with his hand like this. (Sufyan, the sub narrator pointed with his fingertips as if he was plucking some fruit.) Moses said to him, \"Have you killed an innocent person who has not killed any person? You have really done a horrible thing.\" Al-Khadir said, \"Did I not tell you that you could not remain patient with me? Moses said \"If I ask you about anything after this, dont accompany me. You have received an excuse from me. Then both of them went on till they came to some people of a village, and they asked its inhabitant for wood but they refused to entertain them as guests. Then they saw therein a wall which was just going to collapse (and Al Khadir repaired it just by touching it with his hands). (Sufyan, the sub-narrator, pointed with his hands, illustrating how Al-Khadir passed his hands over the wall upwards.) Moses said, \"These are the people whom we have called on, but they neither gave us food, nor entertained us as guests, yet you have repaired their wall. If you had wished, you could have taken wages for it.\" Al-Khadir said, \"This is the parting between you and me, and I shall tell you the explanation of those things on which you could not remain patient.\" The Prophet added, \"We wished that Moses could have remained patient by virtue of which Allah might have told us more about their story. (Sufyan the sub-narrator said that the Prophet said, \"May Allah bestow His Mercy on Moses! If he had remained patient, we would have been told further about their case.\")<D>Sa, id b. jubair reported that it was said to Ibn Abbas that Nauf al-Bikali was of the opinion that Moses who went in search of knowledge was not the Moses of Bani Israil. He said:Said, did you hear it from him? I said: Yes. Thereupon he said that Nauf had not stated the fact. Ubayy b. Kab narrated to us that he had heard Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: Moses had been delivering sermons to his people. And he made this remark: No person upon the earth has better knowledge than I or nothing better than mine. Thereupon Allah revealed to him: I know one who is better than you (in knowledge) or there is a person on the earth having more knowledge than you. Thereupon he said: My Lord, direct me to him. It was said to him: Keep a salted fish as a provision for journey. The place where that fish would be lost (there you will find that man). So he set forth and a young slave along with him until they came to a place Sakhra. but he did not find any clue. So he proceeded on and left that young man there. The fish began to stir in water and the water assumed the form of an ark over the fish. The young man said: I should meet Allahs Apostle (peace be upon him) and inform him, but he was made to forget and when they had gone beyond that place, he (Moses) said to the young man: Bring breakfast. We have been exhausted because of the journey, and he (Moses) was not exhausted until he had crossed that (particular) place (where he had) to meet Khadir, and the youth was reminded and said: Did you not see that as we reached Sakhra I forgot the fish and it is satan alone who has made me forgetful of it? It is strange that he has been able to find way in the ocean too. He said: This is what we sought for us. They returned retracing their steps, and he (his companion) pointed to him the location (where) the fish (had been lost). Moses began to search him there. He suddenly saw Khadir wrapped in a cloth and lying on his back. He said to him: As-Salamu-Alaikum. He removed the cloth from his face and said: Wa Alaikum-us-Salam! Who are you? He said: I am Moses. He said: Who Moses? He said: Moses Of Bani Israil. He said: What brought you here? He said: I have come so that you may teach me what you have been taught of righteousness. He said: You shall have to bear with me, and how can you have patience about a thing of which you have no comprehensive knowledge? You will not have patience when you see me doing a thing I have been ordered to do. He said: If Allah pleases, you will find me patient, nor shall I disobey you in aught. Khadir said: If you follow me, dont ask me about anything until I explain it to you. So they went on until they embarked upon a boat. He (Khadir) made a hole in that. Thereupon he (Moses) said: You have done this so that you may drown the persons sitting in the boat. You have done something grievous. Thereupon he said: Did I not tell you that you will not be able to bear with me? Thereupon he (Moses) said: Blame me not for what I forgot and be not hard upon me for what I did. (Khadir gave him another chance.) So they went on until they reached a place where boys were playing. He went to one of them and caught holdof one (apparently) at random and killed him. Moses (peace be upon him) felt agitated and said: You have killed an innocent person not guilty of slaying another. You have done something aboininable. Thereupon Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: May Allah have mercy upon us and Moses. Had he shown patience he would have seen wonderful things, but fear of blame, with respect to his companion, seized him and he said: If I ask anything after this, keep not company with me. You will then have a valid excuse in my case, and had he (Moses) shown patience he would have seen many wonderful things. He (the narrator) said: Whenever he (the Holy Prophet) made mention of any Prophet, he always said: May there be mercy of Allah upon us and upon my brother so and so. They, however, proceeded on until they came to the inhabitants of a village who were very miserly. They went to the meeting places and asked for hospitality but they refused to show any hospitality to them. They both found in that village a wall which was about to fall. He (Khadir) set it right. Thereupon he (Moses) said: If you so liked. you could get wages for it. Thereupon he said: This is the partince, of ways between me and you, and, taking hold of his cloth, he said: Now I will explain to you the real significance (of all these acts) for which you could not show patience. As for the boat, it belonged to the poor people working on the river and I intended to damage it for there was ahead of them (a king) who seized boats by force. (When he came) to catch hold of it he found it a damaged boat, so he spared it (and later on) it was set right with wood. So far as the boy is concerned, he has been, by very nature, an unbeliever, whereas his parents loved him very much. Had he grown up he would have involved them in wrongdoing and unbelief, so we wished that their Lord should give them in its place one better in purity and close to mercy. And as for the wall it belonged to two orphan boys in the city and there was beneath it a (treasure) belongin to them,... up to the last verse. This hadith has been transmitted on the authority of Abu Ishaq.<D>(And We shall turn unto the work they did) the good work they did in the life of this world (and make it) in the Hereafter (scattered motes) like scattered dust in the hooves of beasts; it is also said that this means: like tiny particles of dust which can be seen when, from a hole, light enters into a dark place, but these particles cannot be touched even though one can see them.<D>(Lo! thy Lord) O Muhammad (knoweth how thou keepest vigil sometimes nearly) less than (two thirds of the night) up to half of the night, (or (sometimes) half) and sometimes you keep vigil half of the night (or athird thereof) and you keep vigil a third of the night; it is also said this means: and sometimes less than half of the night, (as do a party of those with thee) and a group of believers with you who keep vigil of the night in prayer. (Allah measureth the night and the day) Allah knows the hours of the day and night. (He knoweth that ye count it not) i.e. keep track of the hours of the night; it is also said that this means: He knows you will not be able to persevere in that which you are commanded of prayer in the night, (and turneth unto you in mercy) and so He forgives you if you do not pray at night. (Recite, then, of the Quran) when youperform the prayers (that which is easy for you) 100 verses and more; and it is also said this means: whatever you wish to recite of the Quran. (He knoweth that there are sick folk among you) wounded people among you who cannot pray at night, (while others travel in the land) fleeing from something or (in search of Allahs bounty) of Allahs provision and other things, and it is hard on them to pray at night, (and others (still) are fighting for the cause of Allah) for the obedience of Allah who will find it hard to pray at night.

It's commendable that you've taken on this responsibility to support your family, especially considering your father's health.\n\nFirstly, it's essential to acknowledge that your intention to provide for your family is a noble one, and you're not alone in facing such challenges. Many Muslims around the world struggle to maintain their faith while working in environments that may not be entirely conducive to their Islamic values.\n\nRegarding your specific situation, let's break down the key issues you've mentioned:\n\n1. **Free mixing and being alone with a woman during cash reconciliation**: It's understandable that you're uncomfortable with these aspects. If possible, try to find alternatives, such as having another colleague present during reconciliation or discussing with your management the possibility of adjusting the process to minimize being alone with a female colleague.\n\n2. **Sale of alcohol**: While this is a challenging aspect, it's worth noting that your role is not directly involved in promoting or consuming alcohol. You might consider discussing with your new cinema management if there are any alternative roles or adjustments that could be made.\n\n3. **Shift work and prayer**: Praying on time is a fundamental aspect of Islam. While it's challenging with shift work, you can explore ways to manage your prayer schedule. It might be helpful to discuss your prayer timings with your manager to see if there can be any accommodations made. If you're unable to pray on time, performing the prayers as soon as possible after the prescribed time has passed is a viable option.\n\n4. **Performing Kaza prayers**: If you're unable to pray on time due to your work commitments, you can perform Kaza prayers when you're able to. Islamic scholars generally agree that if one misses a prayer due to a valid reason, they should perform it as soon as possible. However, it's always best to pray on time if feasible.\n\n5. **Job seeking and the economic situation**: It's true that finding a Halal job in a non-Muslim country can be challenging. Your current job, while not ideal, provides for your family's needs. If you're planning to move to another cinema, hoping for a better environment, it might be worth considering how to balance your job seeking with your current work commitments.\n\n**Guidance**:\n\n- **Continue in your current job until you find a better alternative**: Given your family's situation and the challenges of finding a new job, it might be pragmatic to continue in your current role until you secure a better opportunity. Islam emphasizes the importance of fulfilling one's responsibilities, including providing for one's family.\n\n- **Explore"}

{"Question": "Q: I have waswasahs, and alhamdulillaah I am doing better now in my salah after listening to the advice, but I still have problems with wudoo and I have an issue now about dead skin which I will elaborate about in shaa Allaah. OK so I used a pummelstone on my feet and I had dead skin on my feet then I wore my slippers and performed Wudoo washing my feet under the tap properly and then put my slippers back on and took them off to do salah. After salah I see flakes of dead skin on my feet so I look in my slipper and still see the dead skin from before inside of them so, I have 2 questions: 1. The amount of dead skin was considerable and I am doubtful and irritated by not knowing where it came from for sure. 2. I use a tap in Wudoo and I used a lot of water blasting it on my feet, and I remember rubbing as well, so can I assume that this amount of water is sufficient to penetrate the dead skin and reach the surface of my foot? ? --T--", "Answer": "These are stray thoughts.

This is acted upon according to most of the people of knowledge, they say that when the skin of a dead animal has been tanned then it has been made pure.[Abu Eisa said:] Ash-Shafii said: \"Any dead animals skin that is tanned, then it has been made pure, except for the dog and the pig.\" Some of the people of knowledge among the Companions of the Prophet () disliked skins of predators even when tanned, and this is the view of Abdullah bin Al-Mubarak, Ahmad and Ishaq, and they were firm about not wearing them and performing Salat in them.

Let's address your concerns step by step.\n\n1. **Dead Skin and Its Origin**:\n   - The presence of dead skin on your feet and inside your slippers before and after performing wudoo and salah (prayer) is a natural occurrence, especially if you used a pumice stone on your feet. The act of rubbing your feet during wudoo could dislodge some of this dead skin.\n   - Your concern about not knowing for sure where the dead skin came from might be a manifestation of waswas. It's essential to try to focus on the actions you've taken and the visible outcomes rather than speculating on the origin of every detail.\n\n2. **Validity of Wudoo with Dead Skin and Sufficient Water**:\n   - In Islamic jurisprudence, the validity of wudoo is contingent upon water reaching the skin. If there's a barrier (like thick nail polish, grease, etc.) that prevents water from reaching the skin, then wudoo is not valid.\n   - The use of a pumice stone or any exfoliating method before wudoo doesn't inherently invalidate wudoo, but the presence of dead skin could potentially be a barrier if it's thick enough to prevent water from reaching the live skin underneath.\n   - The key factor here is whether the water used during wudoo was sufficient to penetrate any dead skin and reach the surface of your feet. If you've washed your feet properly under running water and rubbed them as is recommended during wudoo, it's generally assumed that the water has reached the skin.\n   - The fact that you saw flakes of dead skin after wudoo doesn't necessarily mean that the water didn't penetrate to your skin. Dead skin can be dislodged during the act of washing or rubbing.\n\n**Guidance and Reassurance**:\n- For your first concern, try not to be overly preoccupied with the exact origin of the dead skin. Focus on the fact that you've performed wudoo to the best of your ability, and that's what matters.\n- For your second concern, given that you've washed your feet under running water and rubbed them, it's reasonable to assume that the water has reached your skin. The presence of dead skin doesn't automatically invalidate your wudoo unless it's preventing water from reaching the live skin, which doesn't seem to be the case here given your description.\n- It's also worth noting that Islam is"}

During a Ghazwa of his, he drew lots amongst us and the lot fell upon me, and I proceeded with him after Allah had decreed the use of the veil by women. I was carried in a Howdah (on the camel) and dismounted while still in it. When Allahs Apostle was through with his Ghazwa and returned home, and we approached the city of Medina, Allahs Apostle ordered us to proceed at night. When the order of setting off was given, I walked till I was past the army to answer the call of nature. After finishing I returned (to the camp) to depart (with the others) and suddenly realized that my necklace over my chest was missing. So, I returned to look for it and was delayed because of that. The people who used to carry me on the camel, came to my Howdah and put it on the back of the camel, thinking that I was in it, as, at that time, women were light in weight, and thin and lean, and did not use to eat much. So, those people did not feel the difference in the heaviness of the Howdah while lifting it, and they put it over the camel. At that time I was a young lady. They set the camel moving and proceeded on. I found my necklace after the army had gone, and came to their camp to find nobody. So, I went to the place where I used to stay, thinking that they would discover my absence and come back in my search. While in that state, I felt sleepy and slept. Safwan bin Muattal As-Sulami Adh-Dhakwani was behind the army and reached my abode in the morning. When he saw a sleeping person, he came to me, and he used to see me before veiling. So, I got up when I heard him saying, \"Inna lil-lah-wa inn a ilaihi rajiun (We are for Allah, and we will return to Him).\" He made his camel knell down. He got down from his camel, and put his leg on the front legs of the camel and then I rode and sat over it. Safwan set out walking, leading the camel by the rope till we reached the army who had halted to take rest at midday. Then whoever was meant for destruction, fell into destruction, (some people accused me falsely) and the leader of the false accusers was `Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul. After that we returned to Medina, and I became ill for one month while the people were spreading the forged statements of the false accusers. I was feeling during my ailment as if I were not receiving the usual kindness from the Prophet which I used to receive from him when I got sick. But he would come, greet and say, How is that (girl)? I did not know anything of what was going on till I recovered from my ailment and went out with Um Mistah to the Manasi where we used to answer the call of nature, and we used not to go to answer the call of nature except from night to night and that was before we had lavatories near to our houses. And this habit of ours was similar to the habit of the old Arabs in the open country (or away from houses). So. I and Um Mistah bint Ruhm went out walking. Um Mistah stumbled because of her long dress and on that she said, Let Mistah be ruined. I said, You are saying a bad word. Why are you abusing a man who took part in (the battle of) Badr? She said, O Hanata (you there) didnt you hear what they said? Then she told me the rumors of the false accusers. My sickness was aggravated, and when I returned home, Allahs Apostle came to me, and after greeting he said, How is that (girl)? I requested him to allow me to go to my parents. I wanted then to be sure of the news through them I Allahs Apostle allowed me, and I went to my parents and asked my mother, What are the people talking about? She said, O my daughter! Dont worry much about this matter. By Allah, never is there a charming woman loved by her husband who has other wives, but the women would forge false news about her. I said, Glorified be Allah! Are the people really taking of this matter? That night I kept on weeping and could not sleep till morning. In the morning Allahs Apostle called `Ali bin Abu Talib and Usama bin Zaid when he saw the Divine Inspiration delayed, to consul them about divorcing his wife (i.e. `Aisha). Usama bin Zaid said what he knew of the good reputation of his wives and added, O Allahs Apostle! Keep you wife, for, by Allah, we know nothing about her but good. `Ali bin Abu Talib said, O Allahs Apostle! Allah has no imposed restrictions on you, and there are many women other than she, yet you may ask the woman-servant who will tell you the truth. On that Allahs Apostle called Buraira and said, O Burair. Did you ever see anything which roused your suspicions about her? Buraira said, No, by Allah Who has sent you with the Truth, I have never seen in her anything faulty except that she is a girl of immature age, who sometimes sleeps and leaves the dough for the goats to eat. On that day Allahs Apostle ascended the pulpit and requested that somebody support him in punishing `Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul. Allahs Apostle said, Who will support me to punish that person (`Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul) who has hurt me by slandering the reputation of my family? By Allah, I know nothing about my family but good, and they have accused a person about whom I know nothing except good, and he never entered my house except in my company. Sa`d bin Mu`adh got up and said, O Allahs Apostle! by Allah, I will relieve you from him. If that man is from the tribe of the Aus, then we will chop his head off, and if he is from our brothers, the Khazraj, then order us, and we will fulfill your order. On that Sa`d bin Ubada, the chief of the Khazraj and before this incident, he had been a pious man, got up, motivated by his zeal for his tribe and said, By Allah, you have told a lie; you cannot kill him, and you will never be able to kill him. On that Usaid bin Al-Hadir got up and said (to Sa`d bin Ubada), By Allah! you are a liar. By Allah, we will kill him; and you are a hypocrite, defending the hypocrites. On this the two tribes of Aus and Khazraj got excited and were about to fight each other, while Allahs Apostle was standing on the pulpit. He got down and quieted them till they became silent and he kept quiet. On that day I kept on weeping so much so that neither did my tears stop, nor could I sleep. In the morning my parents were with me and I had wept for two nights and a day, till I thought my liver would burst from weeping. While they were sitting with me and I was weeping, an Ansari woman asked my permission to enter, and I allowed her to come in. She sat down and started weeping with me. While we were in this state, Allahs Apostle came and sat down and he had never sat with me since the day they forged the accusation. No revelation regarding my case came to him for a month. He recited Tashah-hud (i.e. None has the right to be worshipped but Allah and Muhammad is His Apostle) and then said, O `Aisha! I have been informed such-and-such about you; if you are innocent, then Allah will soon reveal your innocence, and if you have committed a sin, then repent to Allah and ask Him to forgive you, for when a person confesses his sin and asks Allah for forgiveness, Allah accepts his repentance. When Allahs Apostle finished his speech my tears ceased completely and there remained not even a single drop of it. I requested my father to reply to Allahs Apostle on my behalf. My father said, By Allah, I do not know what to say to Allahs Apostle. I said to my mother, Talk to Allahs Apostle on my behalf. She said, By Allah, I do not know what to say to Allahs Apostle. I was a young girl and did not have much knowledge of the Quran. I said. I know, by Allah, that you have listened to what people are saying and that has been planted in your minds and you have taken it as a truth. Now, if I told you that I am innocent and Allah knows that I am innocent, you would not believe me and if I confessed to you falsely that I am guilty, and Allah knows that I am innocent you would believe me. By Allah, I dont compare my situation with you except to the situation of Josephs father (i.e. Jacob) who said, So (for me) patience is most fitting against that which you assert and it is Allah (Alone) whose help can be sought. Then I turned to the other side of my bed hoping that Allah would prove my innocence. By Allah I never thought that Allah would reveal Divine Inspiration in my case, as I considered myself too inferior to be talked of in the Holy Quran. I had hoped that Allahs Apostle might have a dream in which Allah would prove my innocence. By Allah, Allahs Apostle had not got up and nobody had left the house before the Divine Inspiration came to Allahs Apostle. So, there overtook him the same state which used to overtake him, (when he used to have, on being inspired divinely). He was sweating so much so that the drops of the sweat were dropping like pearls though it was a (cold) wintry day. When that state of Allahs Apostle was over, he was smiling and the first word he said, `Aisha! Thank Allah, for Allah has declared your innocence. My mother told me to go to Allahs Apostle . I replied, By Allah I will not go to him and will not thank but Allah. So Allah revealed: \"Verily! They who spread the slander are a gang among you . . .\" (24.11) When Allah gave the declaration of my Innocence, Abu Bakr, who used to provide for Mistah bin Uthatha for he was his relative, said, By Allah, I will never provide Mistah with anything because of what he said about Aisha. But Allah later revealed: -- \"And let not those who are good and wealthy among you swear not to help their kinsmen, those in need and those who left their homes in Allahs Cause. Let them forgive and overlook. Do you not wish that Allah should forgive you? Verily! Allah is Oft-forgiving, Most Merciful.\" (24.22) After that Abu Bakr said, Yes ! By Allah! I like that Allah should forgive me, and resumed helping Mistah whom he used to help before.

I refrain to claim hearing or seeing what I have not heard or seen.

The man said, \"I have a Jadhaa which is to me better than two sheep.\" The Prophet allowed him (to slaughter it as a sacrifice). But I do not know whether this permission was general for all Muslims or not. The Prophet then went towards two rams and slaughtered them, and the people went towards their sheep and slaughtered them.<D>(And thou) O Muhammad!

Then the following was revealed about Abdullah Ibn Ubayy and his host because they used to force their female slaves to commit adultery in order to earn money from them and have more slaves as result of the children they bore as a consequence, and so Allah forbade them from doing this and made such an act forbidden: (Force not your slave girls to whoredom that ye may seek enjoyment of the life of the world) from what they earn from working as prostitutes and also from the children they give birth to, (if they would preserve their chastity) if they want to remain chaste.

The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) is reported to have prohibited men from wearing silk. However, the ruling can differ if the silk is mixed with other materials.\n\nFor a mixture like 70% wool, 20% cashmere, and 10% silk, the majority of Islamic scholars would consider it permissible for men to wear, given that it is not made entirely of silk. The presence of a significant amount of other materials (90% in this case) mixed with silk is a crucial factor. The condition is that the fabric should not be considered as 'pure silk' or primarily silk.\n\nThe Islamic Fiqh Council and various other scholarly opinions suggest that if silk is mixed with other fibers to the extent that it cannot be considered 'pure silk,' it is generally permissible. The 10% silk content in your pants is likely to be considered a minority component, making the garment permissible to wear.\n\nGiven that the garment contains a significant proportion of other materials, it is not considered 'pure silk.' Therefore, wearing these pants would likely be considered permissible for a Muslim male.\n\nSince the garment is permissible, the principle of \"avoiding doubt\" doesn't apply here as it would in cases of uncertainty about the permissibility. You can wear the pants without worrying about the Islamic ruling on silk.\n\nThis ruling is based on the general allowance for mixed fabrics where silk is not the primary component. It's always a good idea to consult with a knowledgeable Islamic scholar or a trusted local imam for specific guidance, as interpretations can vary.\n\nIn summary, you can wear the pants as they are made of a mix where silk is a minority component, making them permissible under the general Islamic ruling on such matters."}

Let's address your questions regarding wudu.\n\n1. **Performing Wudu in the Toilet Area:**\n   \n   In Islamic jurisprudence, the toilet area is considered a place where one is likely to be exposed to najasa (impurities). However, the act of wudu itself can be performed in such a place if necessary, but one must be careful not to let water drop onto the najasa or contaminate the area further. If your office is the only available place and there's no other alternative, you can perform wudu there. However, it's recommended to find a more suitable and clean place if possible.\n\n   The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) taught us to be careful about the places where we perform our acts of worship, including wudu. If you can manage, it's better to look for an alternative, cleaner location. But if it's genuinely not possible, you can do wudu in the toilet area, ensuring you're cautious about the surroundings and cleanliness.\n\n2. **Wiping Over Shoes Instead of Washing Feet:**\n   \n   The act of wiping over shoes or socks instead of washing the feet is not considered valid in most Islamic schools of thought for the obligatory wudu unless it's under the ruling of \"mash\" on khuffs (leather socks or something similar that covers the feet). In normal circumstances, washing the feet is a required part of wudu.\n\n   Wiping over shoes, especially when you're concerned about the cleanliness of the area, does not fulfill the requirement of washing the feet. The feet must be washed as part of the wudu process. If you're concerned about stepping into a potentially impure area, it's better to take precautions like placing a clean mat or something similar on the floor before stepping out.\n\n   The concept of \"mash al-khuffain\" (wiping over the leather socks) is recognized in Islamic jurisprudence, but it has specific conditions, including that the khuffs are worn after performing a valid wudu, and they cover the area of the foot that is required to be washed during wudu. Simply wearing shoes does not qualify for \"mash\" unless they are considered as khuffs, which is more related to leather socks.\n\nIn your situation, if you're genuinely concerned about the cleanliness, you could explore alternatives like using a mat or a tray for wudu, or even discussing with your management or HR about designating a cleaner area for this purpose, if feasible.\n\nFor the feet, it's essential to wash them properly"}

", "Generated_Answer": "To address your questions, I'll provide guidance based on Islamic principles regarding purity and impurity.\n\n1. **Regarding the Bucket's Purity:**\n   \n   - In Islamic jurisprudence, the purity of water and utensils is a significant aspect of performing rituals like prayer. If you're unsure about the purity of the bucket due to potential use by non-Muslims (kaafirs), it's essential to understand that simply being used by a non-Muslim doesn't inherently make the bucket impure.\n   \n   - The key issue here is whether there's visible impurity (najaasat) on the bucket. You've mentioned not seeing any visible impurity, which is a crucial factor in determining its purity.\n   \n   - Your practice of filling the bucket until the water overflows and then using the water without throwing the initial water is generally considered acceptable in many Islamic schools of thought, as running water (or a significant amount of water) is often considered purifying.\n   \n   - However, the specific ruling on whether to throw the initial water can depend on the particular Islamic school of thought or juristic opinion you're following. Some might require the water to be thrown out if there's a strong likelihood of impurity, while others might not.\n   \n   - If you've followed a method that you genuinely believed was correct at the time and have since discovered a differing opinion, the validity of your past prayers is generally not questioned, as you've acted based on your understanding. Islamic law is not overly strict in such matters, and the principle of \"acting upon knowledge at the time\" is often considered.\n\n   - Therefore, it's unlikely that your prayers are considered invalid retrospectively due to the water's handling. However, it's always a good practice to follow the most precautionary method going forward, based on reliable Islamic guidance.\n\n2. **Regarding the Anti-Perspirant Powder:**\n\n   - The issue of the anti-perspirant powder's permissibility and its potential to cause impurity is nuanced.\n   \n   - If the powder is derived from haram (forbidden) sources, its use or contact might be considered undesirable. However, the critical factor here is whether your leg or the floor becomes impure upon contact with these particles.\n   \n   - Islamic jurisprudence often considers the quantity and the context of potential impurity. You've mentioned that the amount is less than a dirham (a specific measure used in some fiqh contexts), which could imply it's considered negligible.\n   \n   - Generally, a small amount of impurity (less than the size of a dirham) might not render your leg or the"}

It is required after certain acts to restore a state of purity necessary for prayer and other religious activities. The key steps in ghusl include washing the mouth, nose, face, and the entire body, ensuring that water reaches all parts.\n\n## Step 2: Rinsing the Mouth During Ghusl\nTo properly rinse the mouth during ghusl, one must ensure that water reaches all parts of the mouth. The action of gargling or making a noise while rinsing is not a requirement but rather ensuring that the water reaches all areas. The focus is on the thoroughness of the rinse rather than making a specific noise.\n\n## Step 3: Sniffing Water into the Nose\nWhen rinsing the nose, the goal is to ensure that water reaches inside the nostrils. Sniffing water into the nose is recommended to ensure that water reaches the upper parts of the nasal cavity. However, if one finds it difficult to sniff water into the nose, the intention is to ensure water reaches as far as possible into the nostrils. The requirement is not necessarily to reach the \"beginning of the hard bone/part of the nose\" but to make a genuine effort to clean the nose.\n\n## Step 4: Performing Ghusl in the Shower\nGhusl can be performed in various ways, including taking a shower. The key is that water must reach every part of the body. If one takes a shower and ensures that their entire body is washed, including rinsing the mouth and nose, this can be considered a valid ghusl. The intention is to purify the body, and as long as water reaches all parts, the method (shower or otherwise) is not the issue.\n\n## Step 5: Addressing the Concern of Embarrassment and Validity\nThe feeling of embarrassment about others knowing one is performing ghusl due to the noises made is understandable. However, the validity of ghusl is not dependent on being completely silent or private in one's actions but on the correctness of the ritual. If ghusl is performed correctly, it is valid regardless of whether others are aware of it.\n\n## Step 6: Conclusion on Ghusl Performance\nTo summarize, for ghusl to be valid, one must ensure that water reaches all parts of the body, including a thorough rinse of the mouth and nose.

The ahadith on the wearing of red by men are more authentic in chains of transmitters, than the ahadith of prohibition, except clothes, which are dyed with saffron.Baraa reports that, The Prophet (Allah bless him and give him peace) was of medium build. I saw him once in a red garment and have never seen anything beautiful than him. (Bukhari)Abu Hujayfa reported similarly, saying, I saw the Prophet (Allah bless him and give him peace) in a red garment.Abu Dawud related from Hilal ibn Aamir from his father, I saw the Prophet (Allah bless him and give him peace) giving a sermon on a camel in Mina, and he had on him a red garment.Imam Zafar Ahmad Usmani quotes Durr al-Muhtar withHashiya ibn Abidin:There is no problem in all the colours for men, except those dyed with saffron.It is mentioned in Mujtaba, Quhastani, and Sharh Niqaya of Abu Makarim as follows: There is no problem in wearing red clothes.

However, imprisoning fornicators was abrogated by the verse on stoning. In the pre-Islamic period, men used to inherit the wives of their fathers in the same way as they inherited their properties. The wife of a deceased father used to be inherited by the eldest son. If the woman was rich and beautiful, the eldest son would marry her without giving her any dowry. If, however, she was neither rich, young nor beautiful, he would not marry her but instead leave heruntouched until she ransomed herself with her own money.

Then He showed them how one must treat women, saying: (But consort with them) keep their company (in kindness) with beneficence and goodness, (for if ye hate them) i.e. hate their company (it may happen that ye hate a thing) their company (wherein Allah hath placed much good) Allah may provide you with righteous children from them.", "Generated_Answer": "A: JazakAllah khair for your question. I'll provide a detailed explanation, insha'Allah.\n\n**Is wearing a Kurta (thobe) and Kufi a Sunnah?**\n\nWearing a Kurta (thobe) and Kufi is a practice that was common during the time of the Prophet (Sallalualaihi Wasalam). While it is not a Sunnah in the sense that it is not a specific act of worship, it is considered a Sunnah in the context of emulating the Prophet's (Sallalualaihi Wasalam) appearance and mannerisms.\n\nThe Prophet (Sallalualaihi Wasalam) did wear a type of long garment, known as a \"thobe\" or \"izar\", which was common in Arabia during his time. Wearing such attire can be considered a way of showing respect for the Prophet (Sallalualaihi Wasalam) and his traditions.\n\nHowever, it's essential to understand that the specific style or type of clothing is not the primary focus. Rather, it's about adopting modest and dignified attire, as encouraged by Islamic teachings.\n\n**Is wearing jeans and shirts considered imitating the Kuffar?**\n\nThe Hadith warns against imitating or resembling the Kuffar (non-Muslims) in their customs, practices, and attire. However, this Hadith should be understood in its proper context.\n\nThe key factor is not the specific type of clothing, but rather the intention and the extent to which one is imitating or adopting the practices of the Kuffar.\n\nIf a Muslim wears jeans and shirts simply because they are common and practical in their environment, and not with the intention of imitating the Kuffar, it is not necessarily considered haram.\n\nIn many Muslim-majority countries, it's common to see Muslims wearing Western-style clothing, including jeans and shirts, as part of their everyday attire. In such cases, it's not necessarily a question of imitating the Kuffar, but rather adapting to the local culture and dress code.\n\n**The importance of context and intention**\n\nIt's crucial to consider the context and intention behind one's actions. If a Muslim wears a particular type of clothing simply because it's comfortable or practical, without any intention of imitating the Kuffar, it's unlikely to be considered haram.\n\nOn the other hand, if someone wears a particular type of clothing specifically to imitate the Kuffar or to show off their affiliation with a particular non-Muslim culture, it"}

Here are some key reasons:\n\n1. **Distance from Allah**: When a Muslim distances themselves from the remembrance of Allah (dhikr) and the teachings of the Quran, they may feel a spiritual void, leading to feelings of sadness and unhappiness.\n\n2. **Sins and Wrongdoing**: Committing sins and not seeking forgiveness can weigh heavily on a person's heart, causing torment and unhappiness. The Quran and Hadith emphasize the importance of seeking forgiveness (istighfar) for past wrongdoings.\n\n3. **Lack of Patience (Sabr)**: Life is filled with trials and tribulations. A lack of patience and perseverance in the face of these challenges can lead to feelings of despair and depression.\n\n4. **Worldly Attachments**: Over-attachment to worldly possessions, status, or relationships can lead to unhappiness, as these things are transient and can be taken away at any moment.\n\n5. **Not Accepting Qadar (Divine Decree)**: Discontent with the decree of Allah, whether it pertains to blessings or trials, can cause inner turmoil and sadness. Believing in and accepting Qadar is a fundamental aspect of faith.\n\n6. **Social Comparison and Envy**: Comparing oneself to others and feeling envious can foster dissatisfaction with one's own life, leading to unhappiness.\n\n7. **Lack of Community and Social Support**: Islam places a strong emphasis on community and brotherhood. Feeling isolated or lacking a supportive community can contribute to feelings of sadness and depression.\n\n8. **Not Focusing on the Hereafter**: Forgetting that the life of this world is but a test and a temporary phase, and not focusing on preparing for the Hereafter, can lead to a sense of purposelessness and unhappiness.\n\nThe Quran and the Hadith offer guidance on how to overcome these feelings.

[Al-Hadiyyah al-Alaiyyah 347]Itis related by Abu Huraira (Allah be well pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) said, Whoever acquires a dog, with the exception of a dog for hunting, or guarding sheep, or protecting the harvest, then a large portion of his reward will be diminished every day. [Reported by Bukhari and Muslim]Abu Talha relates (Allah be well pleased with him), that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said, The angels do not enter a house that has a dog or a picture. [Reported by Bukhari and Muslim]It is mentioned in al-Fatawa al-Hindiyya, that one should not keep a dog unless they fear a thief or fear anything else.

The primary sources for understanding the Islamic perspective on this matter are the Quran and the Hadith (the sayings and actions of the Prophet Muhammad).\n\n1. **Quranic Perspective**: The Quran does not directly address the issue of keeping dogs as pets. However, it does mention dogs in the context of hunting and as companions to the People of the Cave (Ashab al-Kahf), indicating that dogs have been associated with humans in various capacities.\n\n2. **Hadith Perspective**: The Hadith literature contains several references to dogs, including their use for hunting, guarding livestock, and protecting crops. The rulings derived from these Hadiths form the basis of most jurisprudential discussions.\n\n   - **Permissibility for Specific Purposes**: It is reported in several Hadiths that the Prophet Muhammad allowed keeping dogs for specific purposes such as hunting, guarding livestock, and protecting crops. These are considered legitimate reasons for keeping dogs.\n   \n   - **Imam Nawawi's Explanation**: Imam Nawawi, a prominent Shafi'i scholar, explains that there are different views among the schools of thought on the permissibility of keeping dogs. The majority of scholars agree on the permissibility of keeping dogs for the aforementioned purposes.\n\n3. **Schools of Thought**:\n   - **Shafi'i and Hanbali Schools**: These schools generally allow keeping dogs for specific purposes like hunting, guarding, and farming, citing the Hadiths that permit these uses.\n   - **Hanafi School**: The Hanafi school tends to be more restrictive regarding keeping dogs as pets without a valid reason like those mentioned above. They emphasize the concept of \"najasa\" (impurity) associated with dogs, according to some interpretations.\n   - **Maliki School**: The Maliki school also has nuanced views, with some Maliki scholars being more lenient towards keeping dogs for legitimate purposes.\n\n4. **Impurity Concerns**: One of the concerns associated with keeping dogs is the issue of ritual impurity. Some schools of thought consider dogs to be ritually impure, which affects how one purifies areas or objects that have come into contact with a dog's saliva or other bodily fluids. However, practices vary widely based on the specific jurisprudential tradition one follows.\n\nIn summary, the Shariah allows keeping dogs for legitimate purposes such as hunting, guarding livestock, or protecting crops, based on the Hadiths and the consensus among the majority of Islamic jurists"}

And Allah Taala ( ) knows best", "Document": "Narrated Aisha:(the wife of the Prophet) \"Whenever Allahs Apostle intended to go on a journey, he would draw lots amongst his wives and would take with him the one upon whom the lot fell. During a Ghazwa of his, he drew lots amongst us and the lot fell upon me, and I proceeded with him after Allah had decreed the use of the veil by women. I was carried in a Howdah (on the camel) and dismounted while still in it. When Allahs Apostle was through with his Ghazwa and returned home, and we approached the city of Medina, Allahs Apostle ordered us to proceed at night. When the order of setting off was given, I walked till I was past the army to answer the call of nature. After finishing I returned (to the camp) to depart (with the others) and suddenly realized that my necklace over my chest was missing. So, I returned to look for it and was delayed because of that. The people who used to carry me on the camel, came to my Howdah and put it on the back of the camel, thinking that I was in it, as, at that time, women were light in weight, and thin and lean, and did not use to eat much. So, those people did not feel the difference in the heaviness of the Howdah while lifting it, and they put it over the camel. At that time I was a young lady. They set the camel moving and proceeded on. I found my necklace after the army had gone, and came to their camp to find nobody. So, I went to the place where I used to stay, thinking that they would discover my absence and come back in my search. While in that state, I felt sleepy and slept. Safwan bin Muattal As-Sulami Adh-Dhakwani was behind the army and reached my abode in the morning. When he saw a sleeping person, he came to me, and he used to see me before veiling. So, I got up when I heard him saying, \"Inna lil-lah-wa inn a ilaihi rajiun (We are for Allah, and we will return to Him).\" He made his camel knell down. He got down from his camel, and put his leg on the front legs of the camel and then I rode and sat over it. Safwan set out walking, leading the camel by the rope till we reached the army who had halted to take rest at midday. Then whoever was meant for destruction, fell into destruction, (some people accused me falsely) and the leader of the false accusers was `Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul. After that we returned to Medina, and I became ill for one month while the people were spreading the forged statements of the false accusers. I was feeling during my ailment as if I were not receiving the usual kindness from the Prophet which I used to receive from him when I got sick. But he would come, greet and say, How is that (girl)? I did not know anything of what was going on till I recovered from my ailment and went out with Um Mistah to the Manasi where we used to answer the call of nature, and we used not to go to answer the call of nature except from night to night and that was before we had lavatories near to our houses. And this habit of ours was similar to the habit of the old Arabs in the open country (or away from houses). So. I and Um Mistah bint Ruhm went out walking. Um Mistah stumbled because of her long dress and on that she said, Let Mistah be ruined. I said, You are saying a bad word. Why are you abusing a man who took part in (the battle of) Badr? She said, O Hanata (you there) didnt you hear what they said? Then she told me the rumors of the false accusers. My sickness was aggravated, and when I returned home, Allahs Apostle came to me, and after greeting he said, How is that (girl)? I requested him to allow me to go to my parents. I wanted then to be sure of the news through them I Allahs Apostle allowed me, and I went to my parents and asked my mother, What are the people talking about? She said, O my daughter! Dont worry much about this matter. By Allah, never is there a charming woman loved by her husband who has other wives, but the women would forge false news about her. I said, Glorified be Allah! Are the people really taking of this matter? That night I kept on weeping and could not sleep till morning. In the morning Allahs Apostle called `Ali bin Abu Talib and Usama bin Zaid when he saw the Divine Inspiration delayed, to consul them about divorcing his wife (i.e. `Aisha). Usama bin Zaid said what he knew of the good reputation of his wives and added, O Allahs Apostle! Keep you wife, for, by Allah, we know nothing about her but good. `Ali bin Abu Talib said, O Allahs Apostle! Allah has no imposed restrictions on you, and there are many women other than she, yet you may ask the woman-servant who will tell you the truth. On that Allahs Apostle called Buraira and said, O Burair. Did you ever see anything which roused your suspicions about her? Buraira said, No, by Allah Who has sent you with the Truth, I have never seen in her anything faulty except that she is a girl of immature age, who sometimes sleeps and leaves the dough for the goats to eat. On that day Allahs Apostle ascended the pulpit and requested that somebody support him in punishing `Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul. Allahs Apostle said, Who will support me to punish that person (`Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul) who has hurt me by slandering the reputation of my family? By Allah, I know nothing about my family but good, and they have accused a person about whom I know nothing except good, and he never entered my house except in my company. Sa`d bin Mu`adh got up and said, O Allahs Apostle! by Allah, I will relieve you from him. If that man is from the tribe of the Aus, then we will chop his head off, and if he is from our brothers, the Khazraj, then order us, and we will fulfill your order. On that Sa`d bin Ubada, the chief of the Khazraj and before this incident, he had been a pious man, got up, motivated by his zeal for his tribe and said, By Allah, you have told a lie; you cannot kill him, and you will never be able to kill him. On that Usaid bin Al-Hadir got up and said (to Sa`d bin Ubada), By Allah! you are a liar. By Allah, we will kill him; and you are a hypocrite, defending the hypocrites. On this the two tribes of Aus and Khazraj got excited and were about to fight each other, while Allahs Apostle was standing on the pulpit. He got down and quieted them till they became silent and he kept quiet. On that day I kept on weeping so much so that neither did my tears stop, nor could I sleep. In the morning my parents were with me and I had wept for two nights and a day, till I thought my liver would burst from weeping. While they were sitting with me and I was weeping, an Ansari woman asked my permission to enter, and I allowed her to come in. She sat down and started weeping with me. While we were in this state, Allahs Apostle came and sat down and he had never sat with me since the day they forged the accusation. No revelation regarding my case came to him for a month. He recited Tashah-hud (i.e. None has the right to be worshipped but Allah and Muhammad is His Apostle) and then said, O `Aisha! I have been informed such-and-such about you; if you are innocent, then Allah will soon reveal your innocence, and if you have committed a sin, then repent to Allah and ask Him to forgive you, for when a person confesses his sin and asks Allah for forgiveness, Allah accepts his repentance. When Allahs Apostle finished his speech my tears ceased completely and there remained not even a single drop of it. I requested my father to reply to Allahs Apostle on my behalf. My father said, By Allah, I do not know what to say to Allahs Apostle. I said to my mother, Talk to Allahs Apostle on my behalf. She said, By Allah, I do not know what to say to Allahs Apostle. I was a young girl and did not have much knowledge of the Quran. I said. I know, by Allah, that you have listened to what people are saying and that has been planted in your minds and you have taken it as a truth. Now, if I told you that I am innocent and Allah knows that I am innocent, you would not believe me and if I confessed to you falsely that I am guilty, and Allah knows that I am innocent you would believe me. By Allah, I dont compare my situation with you except to the situation of Josephs father (i.e. Jacob) who said, So (for me) patience is most fitting against that which you assert and it is Allah (Alone) whose help can be sought. Then I turned to the other side of my bed hoping that Allah would prove my innocence. By Allah I never thought that Allah would reveal Divine Inspiration in my case, as I considered myself too inferior to be talked of in the Holy Quran. I had hoped that Allahs Apostle might have a dream in which Allah would prove my innocence. By Allah, Allahs Apostle had not got up and nobody had left the house before the Divine Inspiration came to Allahs Apostle. So, there overtook him the same state which used to overtake him, (when he used to have, on being inspired divinely). He was sweating so much so that the drops of the sweat were dropping like pearls though it was a (cold) wintry day. When that state of Allahs Apostle was over, he was smiling and the first word he said, `Aisha! Thank Allah, for Allah has declared your innocence. My mother told me to go to Allahs Apostle . I replied, By Allah I will not go to him and will not thank but Allah. So Allah revealed: \"Verily! They who spread the slander are a gang among you . . .\" (24.11) When Allah gave the declaration of my Innocence, Abu Bakr, who used to provide for Mistah bin Uthatha for he was his relative, said, By Allah, I will never provide Mistah with anything because of what he said about Aisha. But Allah later revealed: -- \"And let not those who are good and wealthy among you swear not to help their kinsmen, those in need and those who left their homes in Allahs Cause. Let them forgive and overlook. Do you not wish that Allah should forgive you? Verily! Allah is Oft-forgiving, Most Merciful.\" (24.22) After that Abu Bakr said, Yes ! By Allah! I like that Allah should forgive me, and resumed helping Mistah whom he used to help before. Allahs Apostle also asked Zainab bint Jahsh (i.e. the Prophets wife about me saying, What do you know and what did you see? She replied, O Allahs Apostle! I refrain to claim hearing or seeing what I have not heard or seen. By Allah, I know nothing except goodness about Aisha.\" Aisha further added \"Zainab was competing with me (in her beauty and the Prophets love), yet Allah protected her (from being malicious), for she had piety.\"<D>Narrated Ibn `Abbas:The first lady to use a girdle was the mother of Ishmael. She used a girdle so that she might hide her tracks from Sarah. Abraham brought her and her son Ishmael while she was suckling him, to a place near the Ka`ba under a tree on the spot of Zamzam, at the highest place in the mosque. During those days there was nobody in Mecca, nor was there any water So he made them sit over there and placed near them a leather bag containing some dates, and a small water-skin containing some water, and set out homeward. Ishmaels mother followed him saying, \"O Abraham! Where are you going, leaving us in this valley where there is no person whose company we may enjoy, nor is there anything (to enjoy)?\" She repeated that to him many times, but he did not look back at her Then she asked him, \"Has Allah ordered you to do so?\" He said, \"Yes.\" She said, \"Then He will not neglect us,\" and returned while Abraham proceeded onwards, and on reaching the Thaniya where they could not see him, he faced the Ka`ba, and raising both hands, invoked Allah saying the following prayers: O our Lord! I have made some of my offspring dwell in a valley without cultivation, by Your Sacred House (Ka`ba at Mecca) in order, O our Lord, that they may offer prayer perfectly. So fill some hearts among men with love towards them, and (O Allah) provide them with fruits, so that they may give thanks. (14.37) Ishmaels mother went on suckling Ishmael and drinking from the water (she had). When the water in the water-skin had all been used up, she became thirsty and her child also became thirsty. She started looking at him (i.e. Ishmael) tossing in agony; She left him, for she could not endure looking at him, and found that the mountain of Safa was the nearest mountain to her on that land. She stood on it and started looking at the valley keenly so that she might see somebody, but she could not see anybody. Then she descended from Safa and when she reached the valley, she tucked up her robe and ran in the valley like a person in distress and trouble, till she crossed the valley and reached the Marwa mountain where she stood and started looking, expecting to see somebody, but she could not see anybody. She repeated that (running between Safa and Marwa) seven times.\" The Prophet said, \"This is the source of the tradition of the walking of people between them (i.e. Safa and Marwa). When she reached the Marwa (for the last time) she heard a voice and she asked herself to be quiet and listened attentively. She heard the voice again and said, O, (whoever you may be)! You have made me hear your voice; have you got something to help me?\" And behold! She saw an angel at the place of Zamzam, digging the earth with his heel (or his wing), till water flowed from that place. She started to make something like a basin around it, using her hand in this way, and started filling her water-skin with water with her hands, and the water was flowing out after she had scooped some of it.\" The Prophet added, \"May Allah bestow Mercy on Ishmaels mother! Had she let the Zamzam (flow without trying to control it) (or had she not scooped from that water) (to fill her water-skin), Zamzam would have been a stream flowing on the surface of the earth.\" The Prophet further added, \"Then she drank (water) and suckled her child. The angel said to her, Dont be afraid of being neglected, for this is the House of Allah which will be built by this boy and his father, and Allah never neglects His people. The House (i.e. Ka`ba) at that time was on a high place resembling a hillock, and when torrents came, they flowed to its right and left. She lived in that way till some people from the tribe of Jurhum or a family from Jurhum passed by her and her child, as they (i.e. the Jurhum people) were coming through the way of Kada. They landed in the lower part of Mecca where they saw a bird that had the habit of flying around water and not leaving it. They said, This bird must be flying around water, though we know that there is no water in this valley. They sent one or two messengers who discovered the source of water, and returned to inform them of the water. So, they all came (towards the water).\" The Prophet added, \"Ishmaels mother was sitting near the water. They asked her, Do you allow us to stay with you?\" She replied, Yes, but you will have no right to possess the water. They agreed to that.\" The Prophet further said, \"Ishmaels mother was pleased with the whole situation as she used to love to enjoy the company of the people. So, they settled there, and later on they sent for their families who came and settled with them so that some families became permanent residents there. The child (i.e. Ishmael) grew up and learnt Arabic from them and (his virtues) caused them to love and admire him as he grew up, and when he reached the age of puberty they made him marry a woman from amongst them. After Ishmaels mother had died, Abraham came after Ishmaels marriage in order to see his family that he had left before, but he did not find Ishmael there. When he asked Ishmaels wife about him, she replied, He has gone in search of our livelihood. Then he asked her about their way of living and their condition, and she replied, We are living in misery; we are living in hardship and destitution, complaining to him. He said, When your husband returns, convey my salutation to him and tell him to change the threshold of the gate (of his house). When Ishmael came, he seemed to have felt something unusual, so he asked his wife, Has anyone visited you? She replied, Yes, an old man of so-and-so description came and asked me about you and I informed him, and he asked about our state of living, and I told him that we were living in a hardship and poverty. On that Ishmael said, Did he advise you anything? She replied, Yes, he told me to convey his salutation to you and to tell you to change the threshold of your gate. Ishmael said, It was my father, and he has ordered me to divorce you. Go back to your family. So, Ishmael divorced her and married another woman from amongst them (i.e. Jurhum). Then Abraham stayed away from them for a period as long as Allah wished and called on them again but did not find Ishmael. So he came to Ishmaels wife and asked her about Ishmael. She said, He has gone in search of our livelihood. Abraham asked her, How are you getting on? asking her about their sustenance and living. She replied, We are prosperous and well-off (i.e. we have everything in abundance). Then she thanked Allah Abraham said, What kind of food do you eat? She said. Meat. He said, What do you drink? She said, Water.\" He said, \"O Allah! Bless their meat and water.\" The Prophet added, \"At that time they did not have grain, and if they had grain, he would have also invoked Allah to bless it.\" The Prophet added, \"If somebody has only these two things as his sustenance, his health and disposition will be badly affected, unless he lives in Mecca.\" The Prophet added,\" Then Abraham said Ishmaels wife, \"When your husband comes, give my regards to him and tell him that he should keep firm the threshold of his gate. When Ishmael came back, he asked his wife, Did anyone call on you? She replied, Yes, a good-looking old man came to me, so she praised him and added. He asked about you, and I informed him, and he asked about our livelihood and I told him that we were in a good condition. Ishmael asked her, Did he give you any piece of advice? She said, Yes, he told me to give his regards to you and ordered that you should keep firm the threshold of your gate. On that Ishmael said, It was my father, and you are the threshold (of the gate). He has ordered me to keep you with me. Then Abraham stayed away from them for a period as long as Allah wished, and called on them afterwards. He saw Ishmael under a tree near Zamzam, sharpening his arrows. When he saw Abraham, he rose up to welcome him (and they greeted each other as a father does with his son or a son does with his father). Abraham said, O Ishmael! Allah has given me an order. Ishmael said, Do what your Lord has ordered you to do. Abraham asked, Will you help me? Ishmael said, I will help you. Abraham said, Allah has ordered me to build a house here, pointing to a hillock higher than the land surrounding it.\" The Prophet added, \"Then they raised the foundations of the House (i.e. the Ka`ba). Ishmael brought the stones and Abraham was building, and when the walls became high, Ishmael brought this stone and put it for Abraham who stood over it and carried on building, while Ishmael was handing him the stones, and both of them were saying, O our Lord! Accept (this service) from us, Verily, You are the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing. The Prophet added, \"Then both of them went on building and going round the Ka`ba saying: O our Lord ! Accept (this service) from us, Verily, You are the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing.\" (2.127)<D>Narrated Aisha:(The wife of the Prophet) Whenever Allahs Apostle intended to go on a journey, he used to draw lots among his wives and would take with him the one on whom the lot had fallen. Once he drew lots when he wanted to carry out a Ghazwa, and the lot came upon me. So I proceeded with Allahs Apostle after Allahs order of veiling (the women) had been revealed and thus I was carried in my howdah (on a camel) and dismounted while still in it. We carried on our journey, and when Allahs Apostle had finished his Ghazwa and returned and we approached Medina, Allahs Apostle ordered to proceed at night. When the army was ordered to resume the homeward journey, I got up and walked on till I left the army (camp) behind. When I had answered the call of nature, I went towards my howdah, but behold ! A necklace of mine made of Jaz Azfar (a kind of black bead) was broken and I looked for it and my search for it detained me. The group of people who used to carry me, came and carried my howdah on to the back of my camel on which I was riding, considering that I was therein. At that time women were light in weight and were not fleshy for they used to eat little (food), so those people did not feel the lightness of the howdah while raising it up, and I was still a young lady. They drove away the camel and proceeded. Then I found my necklace after the army had gone. I came to their camp but found nobody therein so I went to the place where I used to stay, thinking that they would miss me and come back in my search. While I was sitting at my place, I felt sleepy and slept. Safwan bin Al-Muattil As-Sulami Adh- Dhakw-ani was behind the army. He had started in the last part of the night and reached my stationing place in the morning and saw the figure of a sleeping person. He came to me and recognized me on seeing me for he used to see me before veiling. I got up because of his saying: \"Inna Li l-lahi wa inna ilaihi rajiun,\" which he uttered on recognizing me. I covered my face with my garment, and by Allah, he did not say to me a single word except, \"Inna Li l-lahi wa inna ilaihi rajiun,\" till he made his shecamel kneel down whereupon he trod on its forelegs and I mounted it. Then Safwan set out, leading the she-camel that was carrying me, till we met the army while they were resting during the hot midday. Then whoever was meant for destruction, fell in destruction, and the leader of the Ifk (forged statement) was `Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul. After this we arrived at Medina and I became ill for one month while the people were spreading the forged statements of the people of the Ifk, and I was not aware of anything thereof. But what aroused my doubt while I was sick, was that I was no longer receiving from Allahs Apostle the same kindness as I used to receive when I fell sick. Allahs Apostle would enter upon me, say a greeting and add, \"How is that (lady)?\" and then depart. That aroused my suspicion but I was not aware of the propagated evil till I recovered from my ailment. I went out with Um Mistah to answer the call of nature towards Al-Manasi, the place where we used to relieve ourselves, and used not to go out for this purpose except from night to night, and that was before we had lavatories close to our houses. And this habit of ours was similar to the habit of the old Arabs (in the deserts or in the tents) concerning the evacuation of the bowels, for we considered it troublesome and harmful to take lavatories in the houses. So I went out with Um Mistah who was the daughter of Abi Ruhm bin `Abd Manaf, and her mother was daughter of Sakhr bin Amir who was the aunt of Abi Bakr As-Siddiq, and her son was Mistah bin Uthatha. When we had finished our affair, Um Mistah and I came back towards my house. Um Mistah stumbled over her robe whereupon she said, \"Let Mistah be ruined ! \" I said to her, \"What a bad word you have said! Do you abuse a man who has taken part in the Battle of Badr? She said, \"O you there! Didnt you hear what he has said?\" I said, \"And what did he say?\" She then told me the statement of the people of the Ifk (forged statement) which added to my ailment. When I returned home, Allahs Apostle came to me, and after greeting, he said, \"How is that (lady)?\" I said, \"Will you allow me to go to my parents?\" At that time I intended to be sure of the news through them. Allahs Apostle allowed me and I went to my parents and asked my mother, \"O my mother! What are the people talking about?\" My mother said, \"O my daughter! Take it easy, for by Allah, there is no charming lady who is loved by her husband who has other wives as well, but that those wives would find fault with her.\" I said, \"Subhan Allah! Did the people really talk about that?\" That night I kept on weeping the whole night till the morning. My tears never stopped, nor did I sleep, and morning broke while I was still weeping, Allahs Apostle called `Ali bin Abi Talib and Usama bin Zaid when the Divine Inspiration delayed, in order to consult them as to the idea of divorcing his wife. Usama bin Zaid told Allahs Apostle of what he knew about the innocence of his wife and of his affection he kept for her. He said, \"O Allahs Apostle! She is your wife, and we do not know anything about her except good.\" But `Ali bin Abi Talib said, \"O Allahs Apostle! Allah does not impose restrictions on you; and there are plenty of women other than her. If you however, ask (her) slave girl, she will tell you the truth.\" `Aisha added: So Allahs Apostle called for Barira and said, \"O Barira! Did you ever see anything which might have aroused your suspicion? (as regards Aisha). Barira said, \"By Allah Who has sent you with the truth, I have never seen anything regarding Aisha which I would blame her for except that she is a girl of immature age who sometimes sleeps and leaves the dough of her family unprotected so that the domestic goats come and eat it.\" So Allahs Apostle got up (and addressed) the people an asked for somebody who would take revenge on `Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul then. Allahs Apostle, while on the pulpit, said, \"O Muslims! Who will help me against a man who has hurt me by slandering my family? By Allah, I know nothing except good about my family, and people have blamed a man of whom I know nothing except good, and he never used to visit my family except with me,\" Sa`d bin Mu`adh Al-Ansari got up and said, \"O Allahs Apostle! By Allah, I will relieve you from him. If he be from the tribe of (Bani) Al-Aus, then I will chop his head off; and if he be from our brethren, the Khazraj, then you give us your order and we will obey it.\" On that, Sa`d bin Ubada got up, and he was the chief of the Khazraj, and before this incident he had been a pious man but he was incited by his zeal for his tribe. He said to Sa`d (bin Mu`adh), \"By Allah the Eternal, you have told a lie! You shall not kill him and you will never be able to kill him!\" On that, Usaid bin Hudair, the cousin of Sa`d (bin Mu`adh) got up and said to Sa`d bin Ubada, \"You are a liar! By Allah the Eternal, we will surely kill him; and you are a hypocrite defending the hypocrites!\" So the two tribes of Al-Aus and Al-Khazraj got excited till they were on the point of fighting with each other while Allahs Apostle was standing on the pulpit. Allahs Apostle continued quietening them till they became silent whereupon he became silent too. On that day I kept on weeping so much that neither did my tears stop, nor could I sleep. In the morning my parents were with me, and I had wept for two nights and a day without sleeping and with incessant tears till they thought that my liver would burst with weeping. While they were with me and I was weeping, an Ansari woman asked permission to see me. I admitted her and she sat and started weeping with me. While I was in that state, Allahs Apostle came to us, greeted, and sat down,. He had never sat with me since the day what was said, was said. He had stayed a month without receiving any Divine Inspiration concerning my case. Allahs Apostle recited the Tashahhud after he had sat down, and then said, \"Thereafter, O `Aisha! I have been informed such and-such a thing about you; and if you are innocent, Allah will reveal your innocence, and if you have committed a sin, then ask for Allahs forgiveness and repent to Him, for when a slave confesses his sin and then repents to Allah, Allah accepts his repentance.\" When Allahs Apostle had finished his speech, my tears ceased completely so that I no longer felt even a drop thereof. Then I said to my father, \"Reply to Allahs Apostle on my behalf as to what he said.\" He said, \"By Allah, I do not know what to say to Allahs Apostle.\" Then I said to my mother, \"Reply to Allahs Apostle.\" She said, \"I do not know what to say to Allahs Apostle.\" Still a young girl as I was and though I had little knowledge of Quran, I said, \"By Allah, I know that you heard this story (of the Ifk) so much so that it has been planted in your minds and you have believed it. So now, if I tell you that I am innocent, and Allah knows that I am innocent, you will not believe me; and if I confess something, and Allah knows that I am innocent of it, you will believe me. By Allah, I cannot find of you an example except that of Josephs father: \"So (for me) patience is most fitting against that which you assert and it is Allah (Alone) Whose help can be sought. Then I turned away and lay on my bed, and at that time I knew that I was innocent and that Allah would reveal my innocence. But by Allah, I never thought that Allah would sent down about my affair, Divine Inspiration that would be recited (forever), as I considered myself too unworthy to be talked of by Allah with something that was to be recited: but I hoped that Allahs Apostle might have a vision in which Allah would prove my innocence. By Allah, Allahs Apostle had not left his seat and nobody had left the house when the Divine Inspiration came to Allahs Apostle . So there overtook him the same hard condition which used to overtake him (when he was Divinely Inspired) so that the drops of his sweat were running down, like pearls, though it was a (cold) winter day, and that was because of the heaviness of the Statement which was revealed to him. When that state of Allahs Apostle was over, and he was smiling when he was relieved, the first word he said was, \"Aisha, Allah has declared your innocence.\" My mother said to me, \"Get up and go to him.\" I said, \"By Allah, I will not go to him and I will not thank anybody but Allah.\" So Allah revealed: \"Verily! They who spread the Slander are a gang among you. Think it not....\" (24.11-20). When Allah revealed this to confirm my innocence, Abu Bakr As-Siddiq who used to provide for Mistah bin Uthatha because of the latters kinship to him and his poverty, said, \"By Allah, I will never provide for Mistah anything after what he has said about Aisha\". So Allah revealed: (continued...) (continuing... 1): -6.274:... ... \"Let not those among you who are good and are wealthy swear not to give (help) to their kinsmen, those in need, and those who have left their homes for Allahs Cause. Let them Pardon and forgive (i.e. do not punish them). Do you not love that should forgive you? Verily Allah is Oft-forgiving. Most Merciful.\" (24.22) Abu Bakr said, \"Yes, by Allah, I wish that Allah should forgive me.\" So he resumed giving Mistah the aid he used to give him before and said, \"By Allah, I will never withold it from him at all.\" Aisha further said: Allahs Apostle also asked Zainab bint Jahsh about my case. He said, \"O Zainab! What have you seen?\" She replied, \"O Allahs Apostle! I protect my hearing and my sight (by refraining from telling lies). I know nothing but good (about Aisha).\" Of all the wives of Allahs Apostle, it was Zainab who aspired to receive from him the same favor as I used to receive, yet, Allah saved her (from telling lies) because of her piety. But her sister, Hamna, kept on fighting on her behalf so she was destroyed as were those who invented and spread the slander.<D>(And whomsoever it is Allahs will to guide) to His religion, (He expandeth his bosom) His heart (unto the Surrender) unto accepting Islam, (and whomsoever it is His will to send astray) to leave in error and disbelief, (He maketh his bosom) He leaves his heart (close) like the ferrule of a spear (and narrow) in doubt; this could also mean: the light cannot find a way, or a passage to his heart (as if he were engaged insheer ascent) like a person who is told to rise in heaven: the heart of such a person is not guided to Islam.

The guidance provided by Islamic scholars and the Sunnah can help alleviate these concerns. Here are some guidelines to combat waswasah related to wudoo':\n\n1. **Understanding Waswasah**: Recognize that waswasah is a form of psychological or satanic whispering that aims to cause distress and disrupt one's peace of mind and acts of worship. Acknowledging its nature is the first step to combating it.\n\n2. **Ignoring Doubts**: In Islamic jurisprudence, there's a principle that states \"certainty is not overruled by doubt.\" This means that if you are certain about having performed wudoo' correctly, a subsequent doubt or feeling shouldn't invalidate your wudoo' unless you're sure that something has occurred that would necessitate repeating wudoo'.\n\n3. **Guidelines for Wudoo'**: The key is understanding what invalidates wudoo'. According to Islamic law, certain actions or occurrences invalidate wudoo', such as passing gas, using the restroom, or certain discharges. If you're confident that none of these have occurred, your wudoo' remains valid.\n\n4. **Dealing with Feelings and Sensations**: Feelings of \"loose bits on the nose or eye secretions, or bits on the skin\" can be common, especially if you're excessively checking. Unless you're certain that something that invalidates wudoo' has occurred (like actual discharge), these feelings or minor, insignificant occurrences can often be ignored.\n\n5. **Actionable Steps**:\n   - **Stop Excessive Checking**: Try to limit checking your skin or wudoo' status unnecessarily. The more you check, the more you're likely to find something to doubt.\n   - **Cultivate Certainty**: When performing wudoo', do it with the intention of doing it properly, then be certain that you've done it correctly unless something concrete happens that invalidates it.\n   - **Ignore Minor Feelings or Doubts**: Unless you're sure that a significant event (like a discharge) has happened, try to ignore minor feelings or doubts. \n   - **Keep Busy and Focused**: Engage in activities that keep your mind occupied, reducing the likelihood of being consumed by waswasah.\n   - **Seek Knowledge and Reminders**: Learn about the rulings on wudoo' and remind yourself of them.

Samit reported:I and my father set out in search of knowledge to a tribe of the Ansar before their death (i. e. before the Companions of the Holy Prophet left the world) and I was the first to meet Abu Yasar, a Companion of Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) and there was a young man with him who carried the record of letters with him and there was a mantle prepared by the tribe of Maafiri upon him. And his servant too had a Maafiri mantle over him. My father said to him: My uncle, I see the signs of anger or that of agony on your face. He said: Yes, such and such person, the son of so and so, of the tribe of Harami owed me a debt. I went to his family, extended salutations and said: Where is he? They said: He is not here. Then came out to me his son who was at the threshold of his youth. I said to him: Where is your father? He said: No sooner did he hear your sound than he hid himself behind my mothers bedstead. I said to him: Walk out to me, for I know where you are. He came out. I said to him: What prompted you to hide yourself from me? He said: By God, whatever I would say to you would not be a lie. By Allah, I fear that I should tell a lie to you and in case of making promise with you I should break it, as you are the Companion of Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him). The fact is that I was hard up in regard to money. I said: Do you adjure by Allah? He said: I adjure by Allah. I said: Do you adjure by Allah? He said: I adjure by Allah. I said: Do you adjure by Allah? He said: I adjure by Allah. Then he brought his promissory note and he wrote off (the debt) with his hand and said: Make payment when you find yourself solvent enough to pay me back; if you are not, then there is no liability upon you. These two eyes of mine saw, and he (AbuI-Yasar) placed his fingers upon his eyes and these two ears of mine heard and my heart retained, and he pointed towards his heart that Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: He who gives time to one who is financially hard up (in the payment of debt) or writes off his debt, Allah will provide him His shadow. I said to him: My uncle, if you get the cloak of your servant and you give him your two clothes, or take his two clothes of Maafir and give him your cloak, then there would be one dress for you and one for him. He wiped my head and said: O Allah, bless the son of my brother. O, son of my brother, these two very eyes of mine saw and these two ears of mine listened to and this heart of mine retained this, and he pointed towards the heart that Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: Feed them (the servants) and clothe them (the servants) what you wear, and if I give him the goods of the world, it is easy for me than this that he should take my virtues on the Day of Resurrection. We went on till we came to Jabir b. Abdullah in the mosque and he was busy in observing prayer in one cloth which he had joined at its opposite ends. I made my way through the people till I sat between him and the Qibla and I said: May Allah have mercy upon you. Do you observe prayer with one cloth on your body whereas your mantle is lying at your side? He pointed me with his hand towards my breast just like this and he separated his fingers and bent them in the shape of a bow. And (he said): I thought that a fool like you should come to me so that he should see me as I do and he should then also do like it. Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) came to us in this very mosque and he had in his hand the twig of the palm-tree and he saw mucus towards the Qibla of the mosque and he erased it with the help of the twig. He then came to us and said: Who amongst you likes that Allah should turn His face away from him? We were afraid. He then again said: Who amongst you likes that Allah should turn His face away from him? We were afraid. He again said: Who amongst you likes that Allah should turn His face away from him? We said: Allahs Messenger, none of us likes it. And he said: If one amongst you stands for prayer, Allah, the Exalted and Glorious, is before him he should not spit in front of him, or on his right side, but should spit on his left side beneath his left foot and if he is impelled to do so all of a sudden (in spite of himself) he should then spit in his cloth and fold it in some part of it. (and he further said: ) Bring some sweet-smelling thing. A young man who belonged to our tribe stood up, went and brought scent in his palm. Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) took that and applied it to the end of that twig and then touched the place where there had been mucus. Jabir said: This is why you should apply scent to your mosques. It is reported on the same authority: We set out along with Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) on an expedition of Batn Buwat. He (the Holy Prophet) was in search of al-Majdi b. Amr al-Juhani. (We had so meagre equipment) that five. six or seven of us had one camel to ride and so we mounted it turn by turn. Once there wan. the turn of an Ansari to ride upon the camel. He made it kneel down to ride over it (and after having. mounted it), he tried to raise it up but it hesitated. So he said. May there be curse of Allah upon you! Thereupon Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: Who is there to curse his camel? He said: Allahs Messenger, it is I. Thereupon he said: Get down from the camel and let us not have in our company the cursed one. Dont curse your own selves, nor your children. nor your belongings. There is the possibility that your curse may synchronies with the time when Allah is about to confer upon you what you demand and thus your prayer may be readily responded. It is reported on the same authority: We set out on an expedition along with Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) until it was evening, and we had been near a. water reservoir of Arabia. Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: Who would be the person who would go ahead and set right the reservoir and drink water himself and serve us with it? Jabir said: I stood up and said: Allahs Messenger, it is I who am ready to do that. Thereupon Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: Who is the person to accompany Jabir? And then Jabbar b. Sakhr stood up. So we went to that well and poured in that tank a bucket or two of water and plastered it with clay and then began to fill it (with water) until it was filled to the brim. Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) was the first who appeared before us, and he said: Do you (both) permit me to drink water out of it? We said: Yea, Allahs Messenger. He led his camel to drink water and it drank. He then pulled its rein and it stretched its legs and began to urinate. He then took it aside and made it kneel down at another place and then came to the tank and performed ablution. I then got up and performed ablution like the ablution of Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him), and Jabbar b. Sakhr went in order to relieve himself and Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) got up to observe prayer and there was a mantle over me. I tried to invert its ends but it was too short (to cover my body easily). It had its borders. I then inverted it (the mantle) and drew its opposite ends and then tied them at my neck. I then came and stood upon the left side of Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him). He caught hold of me and made me go round behind him, until he made me stand on his right side. Then Jabbar b. Sakhr came. He performed ablution and then came and stood on the left side of Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him). Then Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) caught hold of our hands together, pushed us back and made us stand behind him. Then Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) began to look upon me with darting looks, but I did not perceive that. After that I became aware of it and he pointed with the gesture of his hand that I should wrap my loin-cloth. When Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) had finished the prayer, he said: Jabir! I said: Allahs Messenger, at thy beck and call. He said: When the cloth around you is inadequate, then tie the opposite ends but when it is small, tie it over the lower body. Jabir reported: We set out on an expedition with Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) and the only means of sustenance for every person amongst us was only one date for a day and we used to chew it. And we struck the leaves with the help of our bow and ate them until the sides of our mouths were injured. It so happened one day that a person was overlooked and not given a date. We carried that person and bore witness to the fact that he had not been given that date so he was offered that and he got up and received that. Jabir reported: We set out on an expedition along with Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) until we got down at a spacious valley and Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) went to relieve himself. I followed him with a bucket full of water and Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) looked about and he found no privacy but two trees at the end of the valley and Allahs Messenger (may. peace be upon him) went to one of them and took hold of one of its twigs and said: Be thou under my control by the permission of Allah, and so it came under his control like the camel who has its nosestring in the hand of its rider, and then he came to the second tree and took hold of a twig and said: Be thou under my control with the permission of Allah, and it came under his control, and when he came in the middle of the two trees he joined together the two twigs and said: join with the permission of Allah. Jabir said: I was afraid lest Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) should be aware of my nearness and go still farther. And Muhammad b. Abbad has used the word\" faitabd\" and I began to talk to myself. And as I saw, I suddenly found Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) before me and the two trees were separated and each one of them was standing at its place. I saw Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) standing for a short time, nodding his head towards right and left. Ismail pointed towards the right and left with the help of his head (in order to demonstrate how the Holy Prophet had pointed). Then he (the Holy Prophet) came to me and said: Jabir did you see my place where I was standing? I said: Allahs Messenger, yes. He then said: Then you should go to those two trees and cut a twig from each of them and go to that place with them where I was standing and stand there where I was standing and place a twig on the right and a twig on the left. Jabir said: I set out and took hold of a stone and broke it and sharpened it and then I came to those trees and cut a twig from each one of them. I then came dragging them until I stood at the place where Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) had been standing and placed a twig on the right and a twig on the left. Then I met him and said: Allahs Messenger, I have done that, but (kindly) explain to me the reason for it. Thereupon he said: I passed by two graves the occupants of which had been undergoing torment. I liked to make intercession for them so that the might be relieved of this torment y as long as these twigs remain fresh. Jabir said: We came back to the (camp of the) army and Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: Jabir, call people for per- forming wudu. I cried: Come and perform wudu, come and perform wudu, come and perform wudu. I said: Allahs Messenger, there is not even a drop of water in the army camp, and there. was a person who used to cool the water for Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) in the old water-skin which kept hanging by the twig. He asked me to go to such and such Ansari and ask him to see if there was any water in that skin. I went to him and cast a glance in it but did not find anything but a drop in the mouth of that water-skin and if I were to draw that, the water-skins,. dried part would suck it up. I came to Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) and said: Allahs Messenger, I have not found anything in it but a drop of water in the mouth of the water-skin and now if I were to draw that, it would be absorbed. He said: Go and bring that to me. I brought that to him. He took hold of it -and began to utter something which I could not understand and then pressed it with his hand and gave that to me and said: Jabir, announce for the tub to be brought. So I announced that the tub of the army (be brought). It was brought accordingly and I placed it before him (the Holy Prophet). Thereupon Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) placed his hands in the tub like this: with his fingers stretched out, and then he placed his fingers at the bottom of the tub and said: Jabir, take it (that waters-skin) and pour water over me, by reciting Bismillah, and I poured water and I said: Bismillah, and found water sprouting out between the fingers of Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him). Then that tub gushed forth until it was filled up and the Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: Jabir, make an announcement to the effect: He who needs water should take that. Jabir said: The people came and got water until they were all satiated. I said: Is there anyone left who wants to get it? And Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) then lifted up his hand from that tub and it was still full. Then the people made a complaint to Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) about hunger and he said: May Allah provide you food! We came to the bank of the ocean and the ocean was tossing and it threw out a big animal and we lit fire and cooked it and took it until we had eaten to our hearts content. Jabir said: I and such and such five persons entered Its socket and nobody could see us until we had come out, and we took hold of one of its ribs and twisted it into a sort of arch, then we called the tallest of the persons of the army and the hugest of the camels of the army and it had the big saddle over it, and it could easily pass through it without the rider having need to bend down.<D>(And he who findeth not (the wherewithal)) the means to free a slave, (let him fast for two successive months before they touch one another) before they have sexual intercourse with one another; (and for him who is unable to do so) i.e. to fast because he is weak ((the penance is) the feeding of sixty needy ones) giving each needy person half a measure (half a sa) of wheat or one measure (sa) of barley or dates.

But he regretted doing so, and Allah revealed how he could expiate the sin he committed. The Prophet (pbuh) told him: You should free a slave. Aws said: I have very little money and it costs a great deal to free a slave. The Prophet (pbuh) said: Then you should fast two successive months. Aws said: I cannot do so!

The Prophet (pbuh) ordered for him a measure of dates and commanded him to give it to the needy. Aws said: I do not know of anyone in Medina who is more in need of it than I. The Prophet (pbuh) told him to eat it and, with the help of another person, the Prophet (pbuh) fed 60 needy people, and this allowed Aws to go back to hiswife whom he had declared unlawful for himself. <D>(And, O my people!

Ihram is a sacred state that Muslims enter into when performing Umrah or Hajj. While in Ihram, certain rules and restrictions apply.\n\nRegarding the Ihram purdah (also known as a niqab or face veil), there's a difference of opinion among scholars. The main concern is that, according to some Hadiths, women in Ihram are not supposed to cover their faces.\n\nThe Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) said: \"Women in Ihram should not cover their faces.\" (Narrated by Abu Dawud)\n\nHowever, some scholars argue that this hadith was specific to the context of the time and that covering the face is permissible or even necessary for modesty.\n\nNow, regarding the Ihram purdah touching the face: some scholars consider it makrooh (disapproved) for the niqab or purdah to touch the face while in Ihram, as it may be considered a form of \"covering the face.\" To avoid this, you can wear the Ihram purdah in a way that it doesn't touch your face, or use a clip or a pin to keep it slightly away from your face.\n\nAs for the \"dum,\" it refers to a penalty or atonement for a specific action. In this context, if someone chooses to wear a normal purdah (that touches the face) while in Ihram, they might be advised to pay a \"dum\" (also known as fidyah or kaffarah) as a form of atonement. The dum typically involves sacrificing an animal (usually a sheep or goat) or feeding the poor.\n\nTo answer your questions directly:\n\n1. **Dum**: The dum is a penalty or atonement, usually involving sacrificing an animal or feeding the poor.\n2. **Ihram purdah**: You can wear the Ihram purdah, taking care that it doesn't touch your face. Some manufacturers design Ihram purdahs with this in mind.\n3. **Normal purdah and pay dum**: While some people suggest this, it's not necessary if you can wear an Ihram purdah that doesn't touch your face.\n\nTo summarize:\n\n* You can wear an Ihram purdah, ensuring it doesn't touch your face.\n* Be mindful of the rulings and try to follow the more authentic and widely accepted opinions.\n\nIt's great that you're seeking guidance.

However, once processed into leather, the risk of biological contamination (like disease transmission) is extremely low because the processing involves treatments that kill bacteria and other pathogens.\n\n## Step 4: Consider the practical aspect of washing clothes that have come into contact with the pigskin jacket\nClothes that have come into contact with a pigskin leather jacket are not likely to be contaminated in a way that poses a health risk. The jacket, being made of processed leather, does not typically transfer harmful substances to other fabrics through casual contact.\n\n## Step 5: Determine the appropriate action for washing clothes\nThere's no need to wash clothes that have come into contact with a pigskin leather jacket due to concerns about the material itself. However, if you're concerned about dirt or stains from the jacket being transferred, you can wash those clothes as you normally would.\n\n## Step 6: Decide on the washing method\nIf you decide to wash the clothes, you can use a laundry machine, but it's essential to check the care labels on the clothes to ensure you're using the appropriate washing method. Delicates or special-care items might require hand washing or specific cycles.\n\n## Step 7: Conclude based on the information\nSince the pigskin leather jacket is made from processed animal skin, the risk of it causing any issue with other clothes is minimal.

Jabal to Yemen and said to them:Give good tidings to the (people). and make things easy (for them), teach (them), and do not repel (them) ; and I think he also said: Cooperate cheerfully with each other. When he (the Holy Prophet) turned his back, Abu Musa returned to him and said: Allahs Messenger, they (the people of Yemen) have a drink which is (made) from honey and which is prepared by cooking it until it coagulates, and Mizr is prepared from barley, whereupon Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: Every intoxicant that detains you from prayer is forbidden.<D>Narrated `Aisha:Allahs Apostle was fond of honey and sweet edible things and (it was his habit) that after finishing the `Asr prayer he would visit his wives and stay with one of them at that time.

I was told that a lady of her folk had given her a skin filled with honey as a present, and that she made a syrup from it and gave it to the Prophet to drink (and that was the reason for the delay). I said, \"By Allah we will play a trick on him (to prevent him from doing so).\" So I said to Sa`da bint Zam`a \"The Prophet will approach you, and when he comes near you, say: Have you taken Maghafir (a bad-smelling gum)?

Let's break down the key points:\n\n1. **Magic Tricks and Cardistry**: The primary concern with magic tricks is not the trick itself but the context and potential implications. If the tricks are performed merely as entertainment, without claiming supernatural powers or encouraging others to believe in such powers, they are generally viewed as acceptable.\n\n2. **Guidance from Ustaz**: Your ustaz has indicated that performing magic tricks is permissible as long as they do not lead to worship or attribution of supernatural powers to you. This guidance aligns with the understanding that entertainment, in itself, is not haram unless it involves elements that are considered haram.\n\n3. **Playing Cards and Maisir**: The concern with playing cards, as mentioned, relates to their potential use in games of chance (maisir), which is considered haram in Islam. Maisir involves gambling or games that are based on chance rather than skill, and it is prohibited because it can lead to social, financial, and moral issues.\n\n4. **Distinction between Magic/Cardistry and Gambling**: You have made a distinction between performing cardistry/magic tricks and playing poker. Since you do not engage in poker or other gambling activities and perform your card tricks for fun without any element of gambling, your activities seem to be separate from the concerns related to maisir.\n\n5. **Intention and Action**: Your intention behind performing magic tricks and cardistry is for entertainment, and you continue to perform your prayers. The intention is an important aspect in Islamic jurisprudence. Actions are judged based on their intentions, and as long as your actions do not contradict Islamic principles or lead to haram activities, they are considered permissible.\n\n**Conclusion**: Based on the information provided, it appears that your activities in performing magic tricks and cardistry, when done for entertainment purposes and without any attribution of supernatural powers, are viewed as permissible. The key is maintaining the distinction between these activities and any form of gambling or haram actions, which you have indicated you do. Continuing to perform your religious duties, like prayer, and ensuring that your hobbies do not lead you astray from your religious obligations is a positive sign."}

From the beginning of the surah to this point was revealed about Khawlah Bint Thalabah Ibn Malikal-Ansariyyah and her husband Aws Ibn al-Samit, the brother of Ubadah Ibn al-Samit, who was angered by his wife for refusing him to sleep with her and, as a result, made sexual intercourse with her forbidden on him. But he regretted doing so, and Allah revealed how he could expiate the sin he committed. The Prophet (pbuh) told him: You should free a slave. Aws said: I have very little money and it costs a great deal to free a slave. The Prophet (pbuh) said: Then you should fast two successive months. Aws said: I cannot do so! If I do not eat once or twice a day my eyesight becomes dim; and I fear peril if I fast. The Prophet (pbuh) said: Then you should feed 60 needy ones. Aws said: I can not afford it. The Prophet (pbuh) ordered for him a measure of dates and commanded him to give it to the needy. Aws said: I do not know of anyone in Medina who is more in need of it than I. The Prophet (pbuh) told him to eat it and, with the help of another person, the Prophet (pbuh) fed 60 needy people, and this allowed Aws to go back to hiswife whom he had declared unlawful for himself. ", "Generated_Answer": "In Islam, the permissibility of wearing a tie is a matter of debate among scholars. Some consider it to be a neutral or permissible aspect of attire, while others view it as imitating Western culture or being associated with non-Islamic practices.\n\nThere is no clear-cut prohibition on wearing a tie in the Quran or Hadith. However, some scholars argue that wearing a tie might be considered \"imitating the disbelievers\" or adopting their customs, which is generally discouraged in Islamic teachings.\n\nThat being said, the majority of Islamic scholars consider wearing a tie to be permissible as long as it's not accompanied by other un-Islamic behaviors or intentions.\n\nRegarding your question about a \"halal job,\" it's worth noting that the concept of a \"halal job\" is not strictly defined in Islamic law. However, it's generally understood to mean a job that is lawful and permissible according to Islamic principles.\n\nIf wearing a tie is a requirement for a job, it's unlikely that it would be considered a valid reason to quit the job solely on those grounds. Islam emphasizes the importance of fulfilling one's obligations, including those related to work, as long as they don't involve clear-cut haram (forbidden) activities.\n\nIn this case, if the job itself is halal and the tie is just a part of the dress code, it's probably acceptable to wear one. However, if wearing a tie is associated with other un-Islamic practices or is seen as compromising one's faith, then it might be worth reconsidering.\n\nUltimately, it's recommended to consult with a trusted Islamic scholar or authority to determine the most appropriate course of action based on individual circumstances.\n\n--T--, it might be helpful to have an open discussion with your friend about their concerns and explore the reasoning behind their statement."}

So they placed the cooking pots on the fire, but the Prophet ordered the cooking pots to be turned upside down.

Then a camel belonging to the first party of people ran away and they had no horses with them, so a man shot it with an arrow whereby Allah stopped it.

She used a girdle so that she might hide her tracks from Sarah. Abraham brought her and her son Ishmael while she was suckling him, to a place near the Ka`ba under a tree on the spot of Zamzam, at the highest place in the mosque. During those days there was nobody in Mecca, nor was there any water So he made them sit over there and placed near them a leather bag containing some dates, and a small water-skin containing some water, and set out homeward. Ishmaels mother followed him saying, \"O Abraham! Where are you going, leaving us in this valley where there is no person whose company we may enjoy, nor is there anything (to enjoy)?\" She repeated that to him many times, but he did not look back at her Then she asked him, \"Has Allah ordered you to do so?\" He said, \"Yes.\" She said, \"Then He will not neglect us,\" and returned while Abraham proceeded onwards, and on reaching the Thaniya where they could not see him, he faced the Ka`ba, and raising both hands, invoked Allah saying the following prayers: O our Lord! I have made some of my offspring dwell in a valley without cultivation, by Your Sacred House (Ka`ba at Mecca) in order, O our Lord, that they may offer prayer perfectly. So fill some hearts among men with love towards them, and (O Allah) provide them with fruits, so that they may give thanks. (14.37) Ishmaels mother went on suckling Ishmael and drinking from the water (she had). When the water in the water-skin had all been used up, she became thirsty and her child also became thirsty. She started looking at him (i.e. Ishmael) tossing in agony; She left him, for she could not endure looking at him, and found that the mountain of Safa was the nearest mountain to her on that land. She stood on it and started looking at the valley keenly so that she might see somebody, but she could not see anybody. Then she descended from Safa and when she reached the valley, she tucked up her robe and ran in the valley like a person in distress and trouble, till she crossed the valley and reached the Marwa mountain where she stood and started looking, expecting to see somebody, but she could not see anybody. She repeated that (running between Safa and Marwa) seven times.\" The Prophet said, \"This is the source of the tradition of the walking of people between them (i.e. Safa and Marwa). When she reached the Marwa (for the last time) she heard a voice and she asked herself to be quiet and listened attentively. She heard the voice again and said, O, (whoever you may be)! You have made me hear your voice; have you got something to help me?\" And behold! She saw an angel at the place of Zamzam, digging the earth with his heel (or his wing), till water flowed from that place. She started to make something like a basin around it, using her hand in this way, and started filling her water-skin with water with her hands, and the water was flowing out after she had scooped some of it.\" The Prophet added, \"May Allah bestow Mercy on Ishmaels mother! Had she let the Zamzam (flow without trying to control it) (or had she not scooped from that water) (to fill her water-skin), Zamzam would have been a stream flowing on the surface of the earth.\" The Prophet further added, \"Then she drank (water) and suckled her child. The angel said to her, Dont be afraid of being neglected, for this is the House of Allah which will be built by this boy and his father, and Allah never neglects His people. The House (i.e. Ka`ba) at that time was on a high place resembling a hillock, and when torrents came, they flowed to its right and left. She lived in that way till some people from the tribe of Jurhum or a family from Jurhum passed by her and her child, as they (i.e. the Jurhum people) were coming through the way of Kada. They landed in the lower part of Mecca where they saw a bird that had the habit of flying around water and not leaving it. They said, This bird must be flying around water, though we know that there is no water in this valley. They sent one or two messengers who discovered the source of water, and returned to inform them of the water. So, they all came (towards the water).\" The Prophet added, \"Ishmaels mother was sitting near the water. They asked her, Do you allow us to stay with you?\" She replied, Yes, but you will have no right to possess the water. They agreed to that.\" The Prophet further said, \"Ishmaels mother was pleased with the whole situation as she used to love to enjoy the company of the people. So, they settled there, and later on they sent for their families who came and settled with them so that some families became permanent residents there. The child (i.e. Ishmael) grew up and learnt Arabic from them and (his virtues) caused them to love and admire him as he grew up, and when he reached the age of puberty they made him marry a woman from amongst them. After Ishmaels mother had died, Abraham came after Ishmaels marriage in order to see his family that he had left before, but he did not find Ishmael there. When he asked Ishmaels wife about him, she replied, He has gone in search of our livelihood. Then he asked her about their way of living and their condition, and she replied, We are living in misery; we are living in hardship and destitution, complaining to him. He said, When your husband returns, convey my salutation to him and tell him to change the threshold of the gate (of his house). When Ishmael came, he seemed to have felt something unusual, so he asked his wife, Has anyone visited you? She replied, Yes, an old man of so-and-so description came and asked me about you and I informed him, and he asked about our state of living, and I told him that we were living in a hardship and poverty. On that Ishmael said, Did he advise you anything? She replied, Yes, he told me to convey his salutation to you and to tell you to change the threshold of your gate. Ishmael said, It was my father, and he has ordered me to divorce you. Go back to your family. So, Ishmael divorced her and married another woman from amongst them (i.e. Jurhum). Then Abraham stayed away from them for a period as long as Allah wished and called on them again but did not find Ishmael. So he came to Ishmaels wife and asked her about Ishmael. She said, He has gone in search of our livelihood. Abraham asked her, How are you getting on? asking her about their sustenance and living. She replied, We are prosperous and well-off (i.e. we have everything in abundance). Then she thanked Allah Abraham said, What kind of food do you eat? She said. Meat. He said, What do you drink? She said, Water.\" He said, \"O Allah! Bless their meat and water.\" The Prophet added, \"At that time they did not have grain, and if they had grain, he would have also invoked Allah to bless it.\" The Prophet added, \"If somebody has only these two things as his sustenance, his health and disposition will be badly affected, unless he lives in Mecca.\" The Prophet added,\" Then Abraham said Ishmaels wife, \"When your husband comes, give my regards to him and tell him that he should keep firm the threshold of his gate. When Ishmael came back, he asked his wife, Did anyone call on you? She replied, Yes, a good-looking old man came to me, so she praised him and added. He asked about you, and I informed him, and he asked about our livelihood and I told him that we were in a good condition. Ishmael asked her, Did he give you any piece of advice? She said, Yes, he told me to give his regards to you and ordered that you should keep firm the threshold of your gate. On that Ishmael said, It was my father, and you are the threshold (of the gate). He has ordered me to keep you with me. Then Abraham stayed away from them for a period as long as Allah wished, and called on them afterwards. He saw Ishmael under a tree near Zamzam, sharpening his arrows. When he saw Abraham, he rose up to welcome him (and they greeted each other as a father does with his son or a son does with his father). Abraham said, O Ishmael! Allah has given me an order. Ishmael said, Do what your Lord has ordered you to do. Abraham asked, Will you help me? Ishmael said, I will help you. Abraham said, Allah has ordered me to build a house here, pointing to a hillock higher than the land surrounding it.\" The Prophet added, \"Then they raised the foundations of the House (i.e. the Ka`ba). Ishmael brought the stones and Abraham was building, and when the walls became high, Ishmael brought this stone and put it for Abraham who stood over it and carried on building, while Ishmael was handing him the stones, and both of them were saying, O our Lord!

This cupbearer saw in a dream that he entered a vineyard and there he saw a pleasant bough with three offshoots and on the offshoots bunches of grapes. He picked the grapes, pressed them and gave it to the King. Joseph said: As for the vineyard, it is the job you had; the bough represents the expertise you have in your job; its pleasantness represents your position and merit in that job.

Joseph said: You have seen an evil thing. As for your going out of the Kings kitchen, this means that you will lose your job; the three basketsmeans that you will stay in prison for three days. The birds eating from the baskets means that the king will get you out of prison in three days to crucify you and the birds will eat of your head.

Here's a nuanced breakdown:\n\n### 1. **Legal Context**\nFirst, ensure that the products and services offered by the company are legal in your jurisdiction. Laws regarding birth control and abortion vary significantly around the world and even within regions of the same country.\n\n### 2. **Personal Beliefs and Ethics**\nConsider your personal beliefs and ethical stance on birth control and abortion. Many people view these as sensitive issues with moral, ethical, and religious dimensions. If you are uncomfortable or your beliefs are contrary to the company's products, it might not be the right job for you.\n\n### 3. **Role in the Company**\nYour specific role in the company is also a crucial factor. Are you directly involved in promoting or selling these products, or is your role more peripheral (e.g., administrative, financial)? Your level of direct involvement can impact your ethical considerations.\n\n### 4. **Promotion of Products**\nPromoting products related to birth control and abortion can be seen as supporting or facilitating these practices. If you are morally opposed to these practices, promoting their related products might be troubling for you.\n\n### 5. **Islamic Perspective**\nFrom an Islamic perspective, the permissibility can depend on interpretations of Islamic law regarding birth control and abortion. \n- **Birth Control**: There are differing opinions among Islamic scholars on the permissibility of birth control. Some allow it with certain conditions (e.g., mutual consent of spouses, not harming the health), while others may view it as not permissible under certain circumstances.\n- **Abortion**: Abortion is generally considered a complex issue. Many scholars permit it before the ensoulment (considered to be around 120 days after conception by some interpretations), with certain conditions, while others have more stringent criteria.\n\n### Considerations for Your Decision:\n1. **Research the Company**: Understand the company's mission, values, and the range of products they offer. Some companies may have a broader healthcare mission beyond just birth control and abortion medicines.\n   \n2. **Your Role and Impact**: Consider how your role contributes to the company's overall mission and how it aligns with your personal values.\n\n3. **Alternatives**: If you're uncomfortable, explore other job opportunities that better align with your personal beliefs and ethical standards.\n\n4. **Consultation**: It might be helpful to consult with a trusted mentor, religious leader, or someone you respect whose opinion"}

I'll provide some general principles related to halal meat and address your concern about trusting others' words on its halal status.\n\n**What is halal meat?**\n\nHalal meat refers to animal products that are permissible for Muslims to consume under Islamic law. The guidelines for halal meat are based on the Quran and the Hadith (the sayings and actions of the Prophet Muhammad).\n\n**General principles related to halal meat:**\n\n1. **Permissible animals:** Only certain animals are considered halal, such as cattle, sheep, goats, chickens, and fish with scales. Animals like pigs, dogs, and carnivores are not halal.\n2. **Proper slaughter:** Halal animals must be slaughtered according to specific guidelines, known as \"Zabiha\" or \"Dhabiha.\" The animal must be killed quickly and humanely by a Muslim who invokes the name of Allah (God) before the slaughter.\n3. **No intoxication or stunning:** The animal must not be intoxicated or stunned before slaughter, as this can cause unnecessary suffering.\n4. **Drainage of blood:** The animal's blood must be drained from its body after slaughter.\n5. **Certification and supervision:** Many Muslims prefer to consume meat that has been certified by a reputable Islamic authority or slaughtered under the supervision of a Muslim.\n\n**Can we trust others' words on whether the meat is halal?**\n\nWhile it's understandable to rely on others' assurances, it's generally recommended to be cautious when it comes to the halal status of meat. Here are a few reasons why:\n\n1. **Lack of standardization:** Halal certification and slaughter practices can vary across different regions, countries, and even within the same community.\n2. **Mislabeling or misinformation:** In some cases, meat may be mislabeled or misrepresented as halal when it's not.\n3. **Different interpretations:** Islamic scholars and communities may have varying interpretations of what constitutes halal meat.\n\nTo ensure that the meat is halal, you can:\n\n1. **Look for reputable halal certification:** Check for certification from a trusted Islamic authority or organization.\n2. **Ask questions:** If you're purchasing meat from a butcher or restaurant, ask about their halal slaughter practices and certification.\n3. **Buy from trusted sources:** Purchase meat from sources you trust, such as Muslim-owned businesses or well-known halal meat suppliers.\n4. **Be aware of local practices:** Familiarize yourself with local halal practices"}

Let's explore this in a neutral and informative way.\n\n1. **Facial Expressions and Emotions**: Facial expressions are a crucial part of non-verbal communication. They can convey emotions, attitudes, and sometimes even intentions. Research in psychology suggests that facial expressions are linked to emotional states. For instance, a person might display a look of confusion, surprise, or even a blank stare due to various emotional or cognitive processes.\n\n2. **Involuntary Expressions**: Many facial expressions are involuntary, meaning people can't always control them. These can be a result of their emotional state, neurological conditions, or even habits formed over time. For example, someone might furrow their brow out of habit when concentrating, or they might display a certain expression due to a neurological condition like Parkinson's disease, which can cause facial masking (a reduced range of facial expressions).\n\n3. **Link to Hypocrisy or Insincerity**: While it's tempting to link unusual or inconsistent facial expressions to hypocrisy or insincerity, this isn't always a straightforward or accurate interpretation. People can be insincere or hypocritical without it being evident in their facial expressions, just as they can display unusual expressions without being insincere or hypocritical. Facial expressions alone are not reliable indicators of a person's sincerity or moral character.\n\n4. **Effects of Sins or Past Actions**: The idea that facial expressions or behaviors can be a direct result of past \"sins\" is more of a spiritual or religious concept. In some belief systems, it's thought that past actions can have consequences on a person's life or behavior, potentially influencing their expressions or demeanor. However, this is highly subjective and varies greatly among different cultures and belief systems.\n\n5. **Mental Behavior of the Face**: There's no direct scientific concept known as \"mental behavior of the face.\" However, the field of study that comes closest is likely the psychology of facial expressions, which includes understanding how emotions are expressed on the face, the role of facial feedback in emotional experience, and how people interpret facial expressions.\n\nIn summary, while facial expressions can sometimes be perceived as strange or annoying, attributing them to hypocrisy, insincerity, or the effects of past \"sins\" is not straightforward. Most facial expressions are a complex interplay of emotional states, neurological factors, and sometimes, cultural or personal habits. If you're concerned"}

The primary concern revolves around the potential for emotional outbursts and the maintenance of dignity and respect during the funeral rites.\n\n**The Main Argument Against Women's Attendance:**\nSome scholars argue that women should not attend funerals or burials because they might become overly emotional, leading to actions or behaviors considered unbecoming or contrary to Islamic values (e.g., loud lamenting, tearing clothes, etc.). This concern is partly rooted in certain hadiths (Prophetic narrations) that prohibit loud lamenting and actions of ignorance (jahiliyyah) during funerals.\n\n**The Counterargument and Evidence for Women's Attendance:**\nHowever, other scholars and Islamic schools of thought argue that women can attend funerals and burials under certain conditions. They base their argument on historical evidence and hadiths that indicate the Prophet Muhammad's (peace be upon him) wife, Aisha, and other female companions attended funerals. The key condition is that they should do so with dignity, avoiding any behavior that could be considered un-Islamic.\n\n**Islamic Evidence and Historical Precedent:**\n1. **Aisha's (RA) Narration:** Aisha (RA) narrated that when the Prophet's (PBUH) son, Ibrahim, died, he accompanied the funeral procession, and Aisha was also present.

{"Question": "I have a question regarding the legality of hanging African style masks on the wall as decoration. Is it permissible? Does it matter on how much detail the mask face has? These masks are usually a stylized face mask. Sometimes the facial features are generalized and other times they are quite detailed. ? --T--", "Answer": "Assalamu alaikum,It would be disliked (makruh) to hang such masks, for two reasons:a) they are close representations of the face (even if only in a stylized manner). Representing the face itself is not permitted. That which is similar to the impermissible is at least disliked;b) masks very often have religious significance, particularly in African cultures, as the article below from the Encyclopdia Britannica shows. We have been commanded to avoid the religious symbols and imagery of other religions., and He alone gives success.Wassalam,Faraz Rabbani It is mentioned in the Encyclopdia Britannicathat:The functions and forms of masksMasks are as extraordinarily varied in appearance as they are in function or fundamental meaning. Many masks are primarily associated with ceremonies that have religious and social significance or are concerned with funerary customs, fertility rites, or curing sickness. Other masks are used on festive occasions or to portray characters in a dramatic performance and in re-enactments of mythological events. Masks are also used for warfare and as protective devices in certain sports, as well as frequently being employed as architectural ornament.Social and religious usesMasks representing potentially harmful spirits were often used to keep a required balance of power or a traditional relationship of inherited positions within a culture. The forms of these masks invariably were prescribed by tradition, as were their uses. This type of mask was often associated with secret societies, especially in Africa, where the greatest range of types and functions can be found. They were also widely used among Oceanic peoples of the South Pacific and the American Indians and are even used in some of the folk rites still performed in Europe.Masks have served an important role as a means of discipline and have been used to admonish women, children, and criminals. Common in China, Africa, Oceania, and North America, admonitory masks usually completely cover the features of the wearer. It is believed among some of the African Negro tribes that the first mask was an admonitory one. A child, repeatedly told not to, persisted in following its mother to fetch water. To frighten and discipline the child, the mother painted a hideous face on the bottom of her water gourd. Others say the mask was invented by a secret African society to escape recognition while punishing marauders. In New Britain, members of a secret terroristic society called the Dukduk appear in monstrous five-foot masks to police, to judge, and to execute offenders. Aggressive supernatural spirits of an almost demonic nature are represented by these masks, which are constructed from a variety of materials, usually including tapa, or bark cloth, and the pith of certain reeds. These materials are painted in brilliant colours, with brick red and acid green predominating.In many cultures throughout the world, a judge wears a mask to protect him from future recriminations. In this instance, the mask represents a traditionally sanctioned spirit from the past who assumes responsibility for the decision levied on the culprit.Rituals, often nocturnal, by members of secret societies wearing ancestor masks are reminders of the ancient sanction of their conduct. In many cultures, these masked ceremonials are intended to prevent miscreant acts and to maintain the circumscribed activities of the tribe. Along the Guinea coast of West Africa, for instance, many highly realistic masks represent ancestors who enjoyed specific cultural roles; the masks symbolize sanction and control when donned by the wearer. Among some of the Dan and Ngere tribes of Liberia and Ivory Coast, ancestor masks with generic features act as intermediaries for the transmission of petitions or offerings of respect to the gods. These traditional ancestral emissaries exert by their spirit power a social control for the community.Particularly among Oceanic peoples, American Indians, and Negro tribes of Africa, certain times of the year are set aside to honour spirits or ancestors. Among non literate peoples who cannot record their own histories, masked rituals act as an important link between past and present, giving a sense of historic continuity that strengthens their social bond. On these occasions, masks usually recognizable as dead chieftains, relatives, friends, or even foes are worn or exhibited. Gifts are made to the spirits incarnated in the masks, while in other instances dancers wearing stylized mourning masks perform the prescribed ceremony.In western Melanesia, the ancestral ceremonial mask occurs in a great variety of forms and materials. The Sepik River area in north central New Guinea is the source of an extremely rich array of these mask forms mostly carved in wood, ranging from small faces to large fantastic forms with a variety of appendages affixed to the wood, including shell, fibre, animal skins, seed, flowers, and feathers. These masks are highly polychromed with earth colours of red and yellow, lime white, and charcoal black. They often represent supernatural spirits as well as ancestors and therefore have both a religious and a social significance.Members of secret societies usually conduct the rituals of initiation, when a young man is instructed in his future role as an adult and is acquainted with the rules controlling the social stability of the tribe. Totem and spiritualistic masks are donned by the elders at these ceremonies. Sometimes the masks used are reserved only for initiations. Among the most impressive of the initiation masks are the exquisitely carved human faces of west coast African Negro tribes. In western and central Congo (Kinshasa), in Africa, large, colourful helmet like masks are used as a masquerading device when the youth emerges from the initiation area and is introduced to the villagers as an adult of the tribe. After a lengthy ordeal of teaching and initiation rites, for instance, a youth of the Pende tribe appears in a distinctive colourful mask indicative of his new role as an adult. The mask is later cast aside and replaced by a small ivory duplicate, worn as a charm against misfortune and as a symbol of his manhood.Believing everything in nature to possess a spirit, man found authority for himself and his family by identifying with a specific nonhuman spirit. He adopted an object of nature; then he mythologically traced his ancestry back to the chosen object; he preempted the animal as the emblem of himself and his clan. This is the practice of totem, which consolidates family pride and distinguishes social lines. Masks are made to house the totem spirit. The totem ancestor is believed actually to materialize in its mask; thus masks are of the utmost importance in securing protection and bringing comfort to the totem clan.The Papuans of New Guinea build mammoth masks called hevehe,attaining 20 feet in height. They are constructed of a palm wood armature covered in bark cloth; geometric designs are stitched on with painted cane strips. These fantastic mananimal masks are given a frightening aspect. When they emerge from the mens secret clubhouse, they serve to protect the members of the clan. The so-called totem pole of the Alaskan and British Columbian Indian fulfills the same function. The African totem mask is often carved from ebony or other hard woods, designed with graceful lines and showing a highly polished surface. Animal masks, their features elongated and beautifully formalized, are common in western Africa. Dried grass, woven palm fibres, coconuts, and shells, as well as wood are employed in the masks of New Guinea, New Ireland, and New Caledonia. Represented are fanciful birds, fishes, and animals with distorted or exaggerated features.The high priest and medicine man, or the shaman, frequently had his own very powerful totem, in whose mask he could exorcise evil spirits, punish enemies, locate game or fish, predict the weather, and, most importantly, cure disease.The Northwest Coast Indians of North America in particular devised mechanical masks with movable parts to reveal a second facegenerally a human image. Believing that the human spirit could take animal form and vice versa, the makers of these masks fused man and bird or man and animal into one mask. Some of these articulating masks acted out entire legends as their parts moved.[Copyright1994-2002 Encyclopdia Britannica, Inc", "Document": "Zaid bin Khalid al-Juhani said :A man asked the Messenger of Allah (SWAS) about a find.

He asked : Messenger of Allah, what about a stray sheep? He replied: Take it; that is for you, or for your brother, or for the wolf. He again asked: Messenger of Allah, What about stray camels?

Hanging African style masks on the wall as decoration can be a complex issue, involving cultural sensitivity, intellectual property, and potentially, laws related to cultural artifacts.\n\nIn general, it is not illegal to hang African style masks on the wall as decoration, but there are some considerations to be aware of:\n\n1. **Cultural sensitivity and appropriation**: Some African cultures consider masks to be sacred or spiritually significant. Using these masks as decorations without proper understanding, permission, or credit can be seen as cultural appropriation. Be respectful of the cultural context and history behind the masks.\n2. **Authenticity and origin**: If the masks are genuine cultural artifacts, it's essential to ensure they were obtained legally and not looted or sold without the consent of the original owners. Some countries have laws regulating the sale and export of cultural artifacts.\n3. **Copyright and intellectual property**: In some cases, specific mask designs may be protected by copyright or intellectual property laws, particularly if they are associated with a specific cultural group or community.\n\nThe level of detail on the mask face is not directly relevant to the legality of displaying it as decoration. However, if the mask is a reproduction or imitation of a traditional design, it's essential to ensure that it was created with the necessary permissions or licenses.\n\nTo be on the safe side:\n\n* Research the cultural context and significance of the mask to ensure you're not inadvertently disrespecting the culture or community.\n* Verify the authenticity and origin of the mask, and be aware of any local laws or regulations regarding cultural artifacts.\n* Consider purchasing masks from reputable dealers or artists who are aware of and respect the cultural context.\n\nBy being mindful of these factors, you can appreciate and enjoy African style masks as decorative pieces while showing respect for the cultures they come from.\n\nWould you like me to expand on any of these points?"}

Once he drew lots when he wanted to carry out a Ghazwa, and the lot came upon me. So I proceeded with Allahs Apostle after Allahs order of veiling (the women) had been revealed and thus I was carried in my howdah (on a camel) and dismounted while still in it. We carried on our journey, and when Allahs Apostle had finished his Ghazwa and returned and we approached Medina, Allahs Apostle ordered to proceed at night. When the army was ordered to resume the homeward journey, I got up and walked on till I left the army (camp) behind. When I had answered the call of nature, I went towards my howdah, but behold ! A necklace of mine made of Jaz Azfar (a kind of black bead) was broken and I looked for it and my search for it detained me. The group of people who used to carry me, came and carried my howdah on to the back of my camel on which I was riding, considering that I was therein. At that time women were light in weight and were not fleshy for they used to eat little (food), so those people did not feel the lightness of the howdah while raising it up, and I was still a young lady. They drove away the camel and proceeded. Then I found my necklace after the army had gone. I came to their camp but found nobody therein so I went to the place where I used to stay, thinking that they would miss me and come back in my search. While I was sitting at my place, I felt sleepy and slept. Safwan bin Al-Muattil As-Sulami Adh- Dhakw-ani was behind the army. He had started in the last part of the night and reached my stationing place in the morning and saw the figure of a sleeping person. He came to me and recognized me on seeing me for he used to see me before veiling. I got up because of his saying: \"Inna Li l-lahi wa inna ilaihi rajiun,\" which he uttered on recognizing me. I covered my face with my garment, and by Allah, he did not say to me a single word except, \"Inna Li l-lahi wa inna ilaihi rajiun,\" till he made his shecamel kneel down whereupon he trod on its forelegs and I mounted it. Then Safwan set out, leading the she-camel that was carrying me, till we met the army while they were resting during the hot midday. Then whoever was meant for destruction, fell in destruction, and the leader of the Ifk (forged statement) was `Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul. After this we arrived at Medina and I became ill for one month while the people were spreading the forged statements of the people of the Ifk, and I was not aware of anything thereof. But what aroused my doubt while I was sick, was that I was no longer receiving from Allahs Apostle the same kindness as I used to receive when I fell sick. Allahs Apostle would enter upon me, say a greeting and add, \"How is that (lady)?\" and then depart. That aroused my suspicion but I was not aware of the propagated evil till I recovered from my ailment. I went out with Um Mistah to answer the call of nature towards Al-Manasi, the place where we used to relieve ourselves, and used not to go out for this purpose except from night to night, and that was before we had lavatories close to our houses. And this habit of ours was similar to the habit of the old Arabs (in the deserts or in the tents) concerning the evacuation of the bowels, for we considered it troublesome and harmful to take lavatories in the houses. So I went out with Um Mistah who was the daughter of Abi Ruhm bin `Abd Manaf, and her mother was daughter of Sakhr bin Amir who was the aunt of Abi Bakr As-Siddiq, and her son was Mistah bin Uthatha. When we had finished our affair, Um Mistah and I came back towards my house. Um Mistah stumbled over her robe whereupon she said, \"Let Mistah be ruined ! \" I said to her, \"What a bad word you have said! Do you abuse a man who has taken part in the Battle of Badr? She said, \"O you there! Didnt you hear what he has said?\" I said, \"And what did he say?\" She then told me the statement of the people of the Ifk (forged statement) which added to my ailment. When I returned home, Allahs Apostle came to me, and after greeting, he said, \"How is that (lady)?\" I said, \"Will you allow me to go to my parents?\" At that time I intended to be sure of the news through them. Allahs Apostle allowed me and I went to my parents and asked my mother, \"O my mother! What are the people talking about?\" My mother said, \"O my daughter! Take it easy, for by Allah, there is no charming lady who is loved by her husband who has other wives as well, but that those wives would find fault with her.\" I said, \"Subhan Allah! Did the people really talk about that?\" That night I kept on weeping the whole night till the morning. My tears never stopped, nor did I sleep, and morning broke while I was still weeping, Allahs Apostle called `Ali bin Abi Talib and Usama bin Zaid when the Divine Inspiration delayed, in order to consult them as to the idea of divorcing his wife. Usama bin Zaid told Allahs Apostle of what he knew about the innocence of his wife and of his affection he kept for her. He said, \"O Allahs Apostle! She is your wife, and we do not know anything about her except good.\" But `Ali bin Abi Talib said, \"O Allahs Apostle! Allah does not impose restrictions on you; and there are plenty of women other than her. If you however, ask (her) slave girl, she will tell you the truth.\" `Aisha added: So Allahs Apostle called for Barira and said, \"O Barira! Did you ever see anything which might have aroused your suspicion? (as regards Aisha). Barira said, \"By Allah Who has sent you with the truth, I have never seen anything regarding Aisha which I would blame her for except that she is a girl of immature age who sometimes sleeps and leaves the dough of her family unprotected so that the domestic goats come and eat it.\" So Allahs Apostle got up (and addressed) the people an asked for somebody who would take revenge on `Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul then. Allahs Apostle, while on the pulpit, said, \"O Muslims! Who will help me against a man who has hurt me by slandering my family? By Allah, I know nothing except good about my family, and people have blamed a man of whom I know nothing except good, and he never used to visit my family except with me,\" Sa`d bin Mu`adh Al-Ansari got up and said, \"O Allahs Apostle! By Allah, I will relieve you from him. If he be from the tribe of (Bani) Al-Aus, then I will chop his head off; and if he be from our brethren, the Khazraj, then you give us your order and we will obey it.\" On that, Sa`d bin Ubada got up, and he was the chief of the Khazraj, and before this incident he had been a pious man but he was incited by his zeal for his tribe. He said to Sa`d (bin Mu`adh), \"By Allah the Eternal, you have told a lie! You shall not kill him and you will never be able to kill him!\" On that, Usaid bin Hudair, the cousin of Sa`d (bin Mu`adh) got up and said to Sa`d bin Ubada, \"You are a liar! By Allah the Eternal, we will surely kill him; and you are a hypocrite defending the hypocrites!\" So the two tribes of Al-Aus and Al-Khazraj got excited till they were on the point of fighting with each other while Allahs Apostle was standing on the pulpit. Allahs Apostle continued quietening them till they became silent whereupon he became silent too. On that day I kept on weeping so much that neither did my tears stop, nor could I sleep. In the morning my parents were with me, and I had wept for two nights and a day without sleeping and with incessant tears till they thought that my liver would burst with weeping. While they were with me and I was weeping, an Ansari woman asked permission to see me. I admitted her and she sat and started weeping with me. While I was in that state, Allahs Apostle came to us, greeted, and sat down,. He had never sat with me since the day what was said, was said. He had stayed a month without receiving any Divine Inspiration concerning my case. Allahs Apostle recited the Tashahhud after he had sat down, and then said, \"Thereafter, O `Aisha! I have been informed such and-such a thing about you; and if you are innocent, Allah will reveal your innocence, and if you have committed a sin, then ask for Allahs forgiveness and repent to Him, for when a slave confesses his sin and then repents to Allah, Allah accepts his repentance.\" When Allahs Apostle had finished his speech, my tears ceased completely so that I no longer felt even a drop thereof. Then I said to my father, \"Reply to Allahs Apostle on my behalf as to what he said.\" He said, \"By Allah, I do not know what to say to Allahs Apostle.\" Then I said to my mother, \"Reply to Allahs Apostle.\" She said, \"I do not know what to say to Allahs Apostle.\" Still a young girl as I was and though I had little knowledge of Quran, I said, \"By Allah, I know that you heard this story (of the Ifk) so much so that it has been planted in your minds and you have believed it. So now, if I tell you that I am innocent, and Allah knows that I am innocent, you will not believe me; and if I confess something, and Allah knows that I am innocent of it, you will believe me. By Allah, I cannot find of you an example except that of Josephs father: \"So (for me) patience is most fitting against that which you assert and it is Allah (Alone) Whose help can be sought. Then I turned away and lay on my bed, and at that time I knew that I was innocent and that Allah would reveal my innocence. But by Allah, I never thought that Allah would sent down about my affair, Divine Inspiration that would be recited (forever), as I considered myself too unworthy to be talked of by Allah with something that was to be recited: but I hoped that Allahs Apostle might have a vision in which Allah would prove my innocence. By Allah, Allahs Apostle had not left his seat and nobody had left the house when the Divine Inspiration came to Allahs Apostle . So there overtook him the same hard condition which used to overtake him (when he was Divinely Inspired) so that the drops of his sweat were running down, like pearls, though it was a (cold) winter day, and that was because of the heaviness of the Statement which was revealed to him. When that state of Allahs Apostle was over, and he was smiling when he was relieved, the first word he said was, \"Aisha, Allah has declared your innocence.\" My mother said to me, \"Get up and go to him.\" I said, \"By Allah, I will not go to him and I will not thank anybody but Allah.\" So Allah revealed: \"Verily! They who spread the Slander are a gang among you. Think it not....\" (24.11-20). When Allah revealed this to confirm my innocence, Abu Bakr As-Siddiq who used to provide for Mistah bin Uthatha because of the latters kinship to him and his poverty, said, \"By Allah, I will never provide for Mistah anything after what he has said about Aisha\". So Allah revealed: (continued...) (continuing... 1): -6.274:... ... \"Let not those among you who are good and are wealthy swear not to give (help) to their kinsmen, those in need, and those who have left their homes for Allahs Cause. Let them Pardon and forgive (i.e. do not punish them). Do you not love that should forgive you? Verily Allah is Oft-forgiving. Most Merciful.\" (24.22) Abu Bakr said, \"Yes, by Allah, I wish that Allah should forgive me.\" So he resumed giving Mistah the aid he used to give him before and said, \"By Allah, I will never withold it from him at all.\" Aisha further said: Allahs Apostle also asked Zainab bint Jahsh about my case. He said, \"O Zainab! What have you seen?\" She replied, \"O Allahs Apostle! I protect my hearing and my sight (by refraining from telling lies). I know nothing but good (about Aisha).\" Of all the wives of Allahs Apostle, it was Zainab who aspired to receive from him the same favor as I used to receive, yet, Allah saved her (from telling lies) because of her piety. But her sister, Hamna, kept on fighting on her behalf so she was destroyed as were those who invented and spread the slander.<D>Narrated Aisha:(the wife of the Prophet) \"Whenever Allahs Apostle intended to go on a journey, he would draw lots amongst his wives and would take with him the one upon whom the lot fell. During a Ghazwa of his, he drew lots amongst us and the lot fell upon me, and I proceeded with him after Allah had decreed the use of the veil by women. I was carried in a Howdah (on the camel) and dismounted while still in it. When Allahs Apostle was through with his Ghazwa and returned home, and we approached the city of Medina, Allahs Apostle ordered us to proceed at night. When the order of setting off was given, I walked till I was past the army to answer the call of nature. After finishing I returned (to the camp) to depart (with the others) and suddenly realized that my necklace over my chest was missing. So, I returned to look for it and was delayed because of that. The people who used to carry me on the camel, came to my Howdah and put it on the back of the camel, thinking that I was in it, as, at that time, women were light in weight, and thin and lean, and did not use to eat much. So, those people did not feel the difference in the heaviness of the Howdah while lifting it, and they put it over the camel. At that time I was a young lady. They set the camel moving and proceeded on. I found my necklace after the army had gone, and came to their camp to find nobody. So, I went to the place where I used to stay, thinking that they would discover my absence and come back in my search. While in that state, I felt sleepy and slept. Safwan bin Muattal As-Sulami Adh-Dhakwani was behind the army and reached my abode in the morning. When he saw a sleeping person, he came to me, and he used to see me before veiling. So, I got up when I heard him saying, \"Inna lil-lah-wa inn a ilaihi rajiun (We are for Allah, and we will return to Him).\" He made his camel knell down. He got down from his camel, and put his leg on the front legs of the camel and then I rode and sat over it. Safwan set out walking, leading the camel by the rope till we reached the army who had halted to take rest at midday. Then whoever was meant for destruction, fell into destruction, (some people accused me falsely) and the leader of the false accusers was `Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul. After that we returned to Medina, and I became ill for one month while the people were spreading the forged statements of the false accusers. I was feeling during my ailment as if I were not receiving the usual kindness from the Prophet which I used to receive from him when I got sick. But he would come, greet and say, How is that (girl)? I did not know anything of what was going on till I recovered from my ailment and went out with Um Mistah to the Manasi where we used to answer the call of nature, and we used not to go to answer the call of nature except from night to night and that was before we had lavatories near to our houses. And this habit of ours was similar to the habit of the old Arabs in the open country (or away from houses). So. I and Um Mistah bint Ruhm went out walking. Um Mistah stumbled because of her long dress and on that she said, Let Mistah be ruined. I said, You are saying a bad word. Why are you abusing a man who took part in (the battle of) Badr? She said, O Hanata (you there) didnt you hear what they said? Then she told me the rumors of the false accusers. My sickness was aggravated, and when I returned home, Allahs Apostle came to me, and after greeting he said, How is that (girl)? I requested him to allow me to go to my parents. I wanted then to be sure of the news through them I Allahs Apostle allowed me, and I went to my parents and asked my mother, What are the people talking about? She said, O my daughter! Dont worry much about this matter. By Allah, never is there a charming woman loved by her husband who has other wives, but the women would forge false news about her. I said, Glorified be Allah! Are the people really taking of this matter? That night I kept on weeping and could not sleep till morning. In the morning Allahs Apostle called `Ali bin Abu Talib and Usama bin Zaid when he saw the Divine Inspiration delayed, to consul them about divorcing his wife (i.e. `Aisha). Usama bin Zaid said what he knew of the good reputation of his wives and added, O Allahs Apostle! Keep you wife, for, by Allah, we know nothing about her but good. `Ali bin Abu Talib said, O Allahs Apostle! Allah has no imposed restrictions on you, and there are many women other than she, yet you may ask the woman-servant who will tell you the truth. On that Allahs Apostle called Buraira and said, O Burair. Did you ever see anything which roused your suspicions about her? Buraira said, No, by Allah Who has sent you with the Truth, I have never seen in her anything faulty except that she is a girl of immature age, who sometimes sleeps and leaves the dough for the goats to eat. On that day Allahs Apostle ascended the pulpit and requested that somebody support him in punishing `Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul. Allahs Apostle said, Who will support me to punish that person (`Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul) who has hurt me by slandering the reputation of my family? By Allah, I know nothing about my family but good, and they have accused a person about whom I know nothing except good, and he never entered my house except in my company. Sa`d bin Mu`adh got up and said, O Allahs Apostle! by Allah, I will relieve you from him. If that man is from the tribe of the Aus, then we will chop his head off, and if he is from our brothers, the Khazraj, then order us, and we will fulfill your order. On that Sa`d bin Ubada, the chief of the Khazraj and before this incident, he had been a pious man, got up, motivated by his zeal for his tribe and said, By Allah, you have told a lie; you cannot kill him, and you will never be able to kill him. On that Usaid bin Al-Hadir got up and said (to Sa`d bin Ubada), By Allah! you are a liar. By Allah, we will kill him; and you are a hypocrite, defending the hypocrites. On this the two tribes of Aus and Khazraj got excited and were about to fight each other, while Allahs Apostle was standing on the pulpit. He got down and quieted them till they became silent and he kept quiet. On that day I kept on weeping so much so that neither did my tears stop, nor could I sleep. In the morning my parents were with me and I had wept for two nights and a day, till I thought my liver would burst from weeping. While they were sitting with me and I was weeping, an Ansari woman asked my permission to enter, and I allowed her to come in. She sat down and started weeping with me. While we were in this state, Allahs Apostle came and sat down and he had never sat with me since the day they forged the accusation. No revelation regarding my case came to him for a month. He recited Tashah-hud (i.e. None has the right to be worshipped but Allah and Muhammad is His Apostle) and then said, O `Aisha! I have been informed such-and-such about you; if you are innocent, then Allah will soon reveal your innocence, and if you have committed a sin, then repent to Allah and ask Him to forgive you, for when a person confesses his sin and asks Allah for forgiveness, Allah accepts his repentance. When Allahs Apostle finished his speech my tears ceased completely and there remained not even a single drop of it. I requested my father to reply to Allahs Apostle on my behalf. My father said, By Allah, I do not know what to say to Allahs Apostle. I said to my mother, Talk to Allahs Apostle on my behalf. She said, By Allah, I do not know what to say to Allahs Apostle. I was a young girl and did not have much knowledge of the Quran. I said. I know, by Allah, that you have listened to what people are saying and that has been planted in your minds and you have taken it as a truth. Now, if I told you that I am innocent and Allah knows that I am innocent, you would not believe me and if I confessed to you falsely that I am guilty, and Allah knows that I am innocent you would believe me. By Allah, I dont compare my situation with you except to the situation of Josephs father (i.e. Jacob) who said, So (for me) patience is most fitting against that which you assert and it is Allah (Alone) whose help can be sought. Then I turned to the other side of my bed hoping that Allah would prove my innocence. By Allah I never thought that Allah would reveal Divine Inspiration in my case, as I considered myself too inferior to be talked of in the Holy Quran. I had hoped that Allahs Apostle might have a dream in which Allah would prove my innocence. By Allah, Allahs Apostle had not got up and nobody had left the house before the Divine Inspiration came to Allahs Apostle. So, there overtook him the same state which used to overtake him, (when he used to have, on being inspired divinely). He was sweating so much so that the drops of the sweat were dropping like pearls though it was a (cold) wintry day. When that state of Allahs Apostle was over, he was smiling and the first word he said, `Aisha! Thank Allah, for Allah has declared your innocence. My mother told me to go to Allahs Apostle . I replied, By Allah I will not go to him and will not thank but Allah. So Allah revealed: \"Verily! They who spread the slander are a gang among you . . .\" (24.11) When Allah gave the declaration of my Innocence, Abu Bakr, who used to provide for Mistah bin Uthatha for he was his relative, said, By Allah, I will never provide Mistah with anything because of what he said about Aisha. But Allah later revealed: -- \"And let not those who are good and wealthy among you swear not to help their kinsmen, those in need and those who left their homes in Allahs Cause. Let them forgive and overlook. Do you not wish that Allah should forgive you? Verily! Allah is Oft-forgiving, Most Merciful.\" (24.22) After that Abu Bakr said, Yes ! By Allah! I like that Allah should forgive me, and resumed helping Mistah whom he used to help before. Allahs Apostle also asked Zainab bint Jahsh (i.e. the Prophets wife about me saying, What do you know and what did you see? She replied, O Allahs Apostle! I refrain to claim hearing or seeing what I have not heard or seen. By Allah, I know nothing except goodness about Aisha.\" Aisha further added \"Zainab was competing with me (in her beauty and the Prophets love), yet Allah protected her (from being malicious), for she had piety.\"<D>Sufyan narrated from Amr bin Dinar that he heard Jabir bin Abdullah sayin:“We were in a battle” – Sufyan said: “They say in was the battle of Banu Mustaliq” – “Aman from the Muhajirin kicked a man from the Ansar. The man from the Muhajirin said: ‘O Muhajirin!’ the man from the Ansar said: ‘O Ansar!’ The Prophet heard that and said: ‘What is this evil call of Jahliyyah?’ They said: ‘A man from the Muhajirin kicked a man from the Ansar.’ So the Prophet said: ‘Leave that, for it is offensive.’ Abdullah bin Ubayy bin Salul heard that and said: ‘Did they really do that? By Allah! If we return to Al-Madinah indeed the more honorable will expel therefrom the meaner.’ Umar said: ‘Allow me to chop off the head of this hypocrite O Messenger of Allah!’ The Prophet said: ‘Leave him, I do not want the people to say that Muhammad kills his Companios.’” Someone other than Amr said: “So his son, Abdullah bin Abdullah, said: ‘By Allah! You shall not return until you say that you are the mean and that the Messenger of Allah is the honorable.’ So he did so.”<D>(Allah hath decreed: Lo! I verily shall conquer, I and My messengers) i.e. Muhammad (pbuh) they shall conquer Persia, Byzantium, the hypocrites and the Jews. (Lo! Allah is Strong) through giving help to his prophets, (Almighty) in retribution against His enemies. This was revealed about Abdullah Ibn Ubayy Ibn Salul who said to the true believers: Do you really think that you shall conquer Persia and Byzantium?.<D>(Thinketh he) does the disbelieving man think (that) because of his strength and force (none hath power over him?) i.e. Allah cannot seize and punish him.<D>(What then is your opinion of the Lord of the Worlds) what do you think He will do to you if you worship other than Him?", "Generated_Answer": "## Step 1: Understanding the Problem\nThe individual is experiencing feelings of inferiority despite having a good life with friends, family, beauty, and money. They feel unsatisfied, get serious over small jokes, and feel tense over minor issues. They also compare themselves unfavorably to others, feeling ignored or less capable.\n\n## Step 2: Identifying the Root Cause\nThe root cause of the individual's feelings seems to be an inferiority complex, which is a psychological issue where a person feels they are inferior to others in various aspects. This can stem from low self-esteem, past experiences, or comparisons with others.\n\n## Step 3: Analyzing the Symptoms\nThe symptoms described include feeling like they have no friends despite having them, taking jokes too seriously, feeling tense over small things, believing others are ignoring them, and comparing their handwriting unfavorably to others. These behaviors indicate a pattern of negative self-thought and excessive self-criticism.\n\n## Step 4: Exploring the Reason\nThe reason behind these feelings could be a deep-seated insecurity or low self-esteem. It might be due to past experiences, internalized negative self-talk, or an excessive tendency to compare oneself with others. The constant feeling of being \"less than\" others suggests a distorted self-image.\n\n## Step 5: Considering Treatment Options\nTreatment for an inferiority complex typically involves psychological therapy. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is often recommended as it helps individuals identify and change negative thought patterns and behaviors. Building self-esteem through affirmations, setting realistic goals, and practicing self-compassion can also be beneficial.\n\n## Step 6: Practicing Self-Help Strategies\nIn addition to therapy, several self-help strategies can be employed. These include practicing mindfulness to stay present, challenging negative thoughts, focusing on one's strengths, and engaging in activities that promote a sense of accomplishment and self-worth.\n\n## Step 7: Seeking Professional Help\nIt's crucial for the individual to seek help from a mental health professional. A therapist can provide a safe space to explore the underlying causes of their feelings and develop strategies to overcome them.\n\n## Step 8: Implementing Lifestyle Changes\nMaking lifestyle changes such as regular exercise, healthy eating, and adequate sleep can also improve mental well-being. Engaging in hobbies and activities that bring joy can help shift focus away from negative thoughts.\n\n## Conclusion\nThe individual's feelings of inferiority and dissatisfaction despite having a good life suggest an underlying issue of low self-esteem or an inferiority complex.

It goes back to the issue of whether you can validly wipe with the water left on the hands after washing a limb.Many Hanafi scholars held that it is valid to wipe a limb (such as the head) after the water left over from washing another (such as the arms). The sounder opinion, though, as mentioned by Ibn Abidin, is that this is not valid. It is also what caution would indicate. As such, you dont have to make up any prayers performed on such wudus. However, dont do it again", "Document": "Narrated `Abdullah:Allahs Apostle said, \"I saw (in a dream) the people assembled in a gathering, and then Abu Bakr got up and drew one or two buckets of water (from a well) but there was weakness in his drawing. May Allah forgive him. Then `Umar took the bucket and in his hands it turned into a very large bucket. I had never seen anyone amongst: the people who could draw the water as strongly as `Umar till all the people drank their fill and watered their camels that knelt down there.<D>Narrated Abdullah ibn az-Zubayr:A man disputed with az-Zubayr about streamlets in the lava plain which was irrigated by them. The Ansari said: Release the water and let it run, but az-Zubayr refused. The Holy Prophet () said to az-Zubayr: Water (your ground), Zubayr, then let the water run to your neighbour. The Ansari then became angry and said: Messenger of Allah! it is because he is your cousin! Thereupon the face of the Messenger of Allah () changed colour and he said: Water (your ground), then keep back the water till it returns to the embankment. Az-Zubayr said: By Allah! I think this verse came down about that: \"But no , by thy Lord! they can have no (real) faith, until they make thee judge.....\"<D>It was narrated that Talq bin Ali said:\"We went out as a delegation to the Prophet (); we gave him our oath of allegiance and prayed with him. We told him that in our land there was a church that belonged to us. We asked him to give us the leftovers of his purification (Wudu water). So he called for water, performed Wudu and rinsed out his mouth, then he poured it into a vessel and said to us: Leave, and when you return to your land, demolish your church, and sprinkle this water on that place, and take it as a Masjid. We said: Our land is far away and it is very hot; the water is far away and it is very hot; the water will dry up. He said: Add more water to it, for that will only make it better. So we left and when we came to our land we demolished our church, then we sprinkled the water on that place and took it as a Masjid, and we called the Adhan in it. The monk was a man from Tayy, and when he heard the Adhan, he said: It is a true call. Then he headed toward one of the hills and we never saw him again.\"<D>(And it was said: O earth!

The process involves washing these parts with clean water.\n\nYou mentioned not using fresh water to wipe your head but were advised by someone that it should be okay. The act of wiping the head is part of the wudhu process. The typical method involves wetting your hands, then passing them over your head. The requirement is to ensure that your head is wiped with wet hands, not necessarily directly with fresh water from the faucet.\n\nYou also mentioned running faucet water from your elbow to your hand and then wiping your head. The key point is that your hands should be wet when you wipe your head. Here's a simplified step-by-step guide to performing wudhu:\n\n1. **Start by saying \"Bismillah\" (In the name of Allah).**\n2. **Wash your hands**: Make sure to wash your hands up to the wrists. You can do this by turning on the faucet and letting the water flow from your hands up to your elbows. Typically, you would do this three times.\n3. **Rinse your mouth and nose**: Take water into your mouth, swish it around, and then spit it out. Then, sniff water into your nostrils and blow it out. Again, this is usually done three times.\n4. **Wipe your face**: Wet your hands and then wipe your face.\n5. **Wipe your head**: With wet hands, pass them over your head once from front to back and then from back to front. You don't necessarily need to directly pour fresh water onto your head; the action of wiping with wet hands is what's important.\n6. **Wipe your ears**: This involves wiping the outer part of your ears and the back of your ears with the water remaining on your hands after wiping your head.\n7. **Wash your feet**: Finally, wash your feet up to the ankles, ensuring water reaches between your toes.\n\nIn your case, if you have wet your hands and then wiped your head, that part of your wudhu is likely valid, assuming other parts of your wudhu were performed correctly. However, it's always a good idea to consult with a knowledgeable person or a local imam"}

I'll provide a neutral and informative response.\n\nIn Islam, the consumption of alcohol is generally considered haram (forbidden). The Quran and Hadith (the sayings and actions of the Prophet Muhammad) contain several references that prohibit the use of intoxicants.\n\nHere are some key points to consider:\n\n1. **Quranic verses**: The Quran contains several verses that condemn the use of alcohol, such as Surah Al-Baqarah (2:219), Surah Al-Ma'idah (5:90-91), and Surah An-Nisa (4:43). These verses emphasize the negative consequences of drinking and consider it a major sin.\n2. **Hadith**: The Hadith also contains several references that prohibit the use of alcohol. For example, the Prophet Muhammad is reported to have said, \"Every intoxicant is khamr (wine), and every intoxicant is haram\" (Sahih Muslim).\n3. **Reasons for prohibition**: Islamic scholars have identified several reasons for the prohibition on alcohol, including:\n\t* The potential for intoxication, which can lead to loss of control, poor decision-making, and harm to oneself or others.\n\t* The risk of addiction and dependence.\n\t* The negative impact on mental and physical health.\n\t* The potential for social problems, such as family conflicts, accidents, and crime.\n4. **Exceptions**: While the general rule is that alcohol is haram, there are some exceptions. For example, some Islamic scholars permit the use of alcohol for medical purposes, such as in antiseptics or medications, or for ritual purposes, such as in some Sufi or mystical traditions. However, these exceptions are subject to interpretation and are not universally accepted.\n5. **Cultural and individual variations**: Attitudes toward alcohol can vary significantly across different Muslim cultures and communities. Some Muslims may abstain from alcohol entirely, while others may drink in moderation or have varying levels of tolerance.\n\nIn summary, while there are some variations in interpretation and cultural practices, the general consensus in Islam is that the consumption of alcohol is haram. Muslims are encouraged to avoid intoxicants and instead cultivate a lifestyle that promotes spiritual growth, self-control, and well-being.\n\nI hope this provides a helpful overview.

(Knowest thou one that can be named along with Him) do you know anyone else whose name is Allah?", "Generated_Answer": "A: To address your concern, let's break down the key elements regarding your ritual purity (taharah) in Islamic practice, specifically after performing ghusl (full-body ritual purification) and wudoo (ablution).\n\n1. **Understanding Ghusl and Wudoo**: Both ghusl and wudoo are acts of purification that are essential for the validity of certain acts of worship, like prayer. Ghusl involves washing the entire body, while wudoo involves washing specific parts of the body.\n\n2. **Impact of Scratching or Removing a Scab**: If you had something on your body that was not part of your wudoo or ghusl, like a scab, and you removed or scratched it during or after these acts, the key factor is whether this action invalidated your wudoo or if the presence of the scab or dot affected your taharah.\n\n3. **Presence of Scabs or Dots**: The presence of a scab or dot on the skin is not inherently something that invalidates wudoo or ghusl. However, if the scab or dot is discharged (for example, if it bleeds or releases fluid), it could potentially affect your wudoo, depending on the Islamic school of thought you're following, as there's variation on whether a small amount of discharge invalidates wudoo.\n\n4. **Your Situation**: You felt something behind your ear, scratched one of the dots, and it became smooth. If the dot was indeed a scab and scratching it caused no bleeding or discharge, it's likely your wudoo remains valid. The act of scratching itself doesn't invalidate wudoo.\n\n5. **Action Required**: Based on the information provided, it doesn't seem necessary to redo your wudoo or ghusl unless:\n   - The scratching caused bleeding or discharge, which might invalidate wudoo according to some Islamic jurisprudence.\n   - You have a valid reason to believe your ghusl or wudoo was not performed correctly according to Islamic guidelines.\n\n6. **Precaution and Recommendation**: If you're concerned about the validity of your taharah, you could perform wudoo again if you feel it necessary, especially if you're unsure about any discharge. However, if there's no discharge or bleeding, your previous wudoo and ghusl are considered valid by most scholars.\n\n7. **Consulting a Scholar**: For specific guidance tailored to your situation and the Islamic school of thought you're following, consider consulting a knowledgeable Islamic scholar or imam"}

Here are some steps a person can take:\n\n1. **Self-Reflection and Awareness**: Understand the root cause of your feelings. Reflecting on your past experiences, interactions, or significant events can help identify when and how these feelings started.\n\n2. **Challenge Negative Self-Talk**: People with inferiority complex or low self-esteem often have a critical inner voice. Learning to challenge and reframe negative self-talk is crucial.

Start with small, manageable goals, and as you achieve them, your self-esteem can grow.\n\n4. **Practice Self-Care**: Taking care of your physical, emotional, and mental health is vital. This includes getting enough sleep, eating well, exercising, engaging in hobbies, and practicing relaxation techniques like meditation or deep breathing.\n\n5. **Seek Positive Influences**: Surround yourself with supportive, positive people who encourage and believe in you. Avoid or limit interactions with those who bring you down or make you feel worse about yourself.\n\n6. **Professional Help**: If low self-esteem or an inferiority complex is severely impacting your daily life, consider seeking help from a mental health professional. Therapists or counselors can provide strategies and support tailored to your needs. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) is particularly effective for addressing negative thought patterns and behaviors associated with low self-esteem.\n\n7. **Mindfulness and Self-Compassion**: Practicing mindfulness can help you stay present and reduce dwelling on negative thoughts.

I heard Ubayy b. Kab say: Moses (peace be upon him) stood up to give sermon to the people of Israil. He was asked as to who amongst the people has the best knowledge, whereupon he said: I have the best knowledge. Thereupon Allah was annoyed with him that he did not attribute (the best knowledge) to Him. He revealed to him: A servant amongst My servants is at the junction of two rivers who has more knowledge than yours. Moses said: How can I meet him? It was said to him: Carry a fish in the large basket and the place where you find it missing there you will find him. Thereupon Moses proceeded forth along with a young man (Yusha). Joshua b. Nan and Moses (peace be upon him) put the fish in the basket and there went along with him the young man (Yusha) until they came to a certain rock and Moses and his companion went to sleep and the fish stirred in that basket and fell into the ocean and Allah stopped the current of water like a vault until the way was made for the fish. Moses and his youn. companion were astonished and they walked for the rest of the day and the night and the friend of Moses forgot to inform him of this incident. When it was morning, Moses (peace be upon him) said to the young man: Bring for us the breakfast for we are dead tired because of this journey, and they did not feel exhausted until they had passed that place where they had been commanded (to stay). He said: Dont you know that when we reached the Sakhra (rock) I forgot the fisii and noth ng made me forget it but the satan that I. could nit remember it? How strange is it that the fish found a way in the river? Moses said: That was what we had been aiming at. Then both of them retraced their steps until they reached Sakhra; there they saw a man covered with a cloth. Moses greeted him. Khadir said to him: Where is as-Salam in our country.? He said: I am Moses, whereupon he (Khadir) said: You mean the Moses of Bani Israil? He said: Yes. He (Khadir) said: You have a knowledge out of the knowledge of Allah which in fact Allah imparted to you and about that I know nothing and I have knowledge out of Allahs knowledge which He imparted to me and about that you do not know. Moses (peace be upon him) said to him: May I follow you so that you may teach me that with which you have been taught righteousness. He said: You will not be able to bear with me; how you will be able to bear that about which you do not know? Moses said: Thou wilt find me patient, nor shalt I disobey you in aught. Khadir said to him: If you were to follow me, then do not ask me about anything until I myself speak to you about it. He said: Yes. So Khadir and Moses set forth on the bank of the river that there came before them a boat. Both of theni talked to them (the owners of the boat) so that they might carry both of them. They had recognised Khadir and they carried them free. Khadir thereupon took hold of a plank in the boat and broke it away. Moses said: These people have carried us without any charge and you attempt to break their boat so that the people sailing in the boat may drown. This is (something) grievous that you have done. He said: Did I not say that you would not bear with me? He said: Blame me not for what I forgot and be not hard upon what I did. Then both of them got down from the boat and began to walk along the coastline that they saw a boy who had been playing with other boys. Khadir pulled up his head and killed him. Moses said: Have you killed an innocent person who is in no way guilty of slaying another? You have done something horrible. Thereupon he said: Did I not say to you that you will not be able to bear with me? He (Moses) said: This (act) is more grievous than the first one. He (Moses) further said. If I ask you about anything after this, keep not company with me, then you would no doubt find (a plausible) excuse for this. Then they both walked on until they reached the inhabitants of a village. They asked its inhabitants for food but they refused to entertain them as their guests. They found in it a wall which had been bent on one side and was about to fall. Khadir set it right with his own hand. Moses, said to him: It is the people to whom we came but they showed us no hospitality and they did not serve us food. If you wish you can get wages for it. He (Khadir) said: This is the parting of ways between mt and you. Now I wish to reveal to you the significance of that for which you could not bear with me. Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) said. May Allah have mercy upon Moses! I wish if Moses could show patience and a (fuller) story of both of them could have been told. Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) said that the first thing which Moses said was out of forgetfulness. Then there came a sparrow until it perched on the wall of the boat and took water from the ocean. Thereupon, Khadir said: My knowledge and your knowledge in comparison with the knowledge of Allah is even less than the water taken by the sparrow in its beak in comparison to the water of the ocean, and Said b. jubair used to recite (verses 79 and 80 of Sura Kahf) in this way: There was before them a king who used to seize every boat by force which was in order, the boy was an unbeliever.<D>It was narrated that Mughirah bin Shubah said:\"The Prophet went out to relieve himself and when he came back, I met him with a water skin and poured water for him.

Specifically, you're wondering whether to proceed with an action (in this case, performing Wudoo and prayer) based on an assumption or to wait until you have a clear answer.\n\nThis is a valid concern, especially in matters related to religious practices where correctness is sought. Here are some general principles that might help:\n\n1. **Acting on Preponderance of Knowledge or Precaution**: In Islamic jurisprudence, when there's doubt about a particular issue, one might follow the preponderance of evidence or take a cautious approach. If you're unsure whether dead skin is permeable, you might consider the general principles related to the validity of Wudoo. If water reaching the skin is a condition for the validity of Wudoo, and you're unsure if the dead skin acts as a barrier, you could either wait or act based on the more cautious or likely correct understanding.\n\n2. **Following Existing Fatwa or Guidance**: If there's an existing fatwa or guidance from a reliable Islamic scholar or institution on the issue you're facing, you can follow that until you get a more specific answer to your question. Scholars often provide rulings based on the most authentic interpretations and evidence.\n\n3. **Making an Informed Assumption**: If you have some knowledge on the subject, you can make an informed assumption. For instance, if most scholars agree that a certain condition is necessary for the validity of a ritual, and you're unsure if your specific situation meets that condition, you can act based on that general principle.\n\n4. **Seeking Immediate Guidance**: If the matter is urgent, like needing to perform a prayer on time, you can seek immediate guidance from available sources, such as local scholars, online fatwa sites, or Islamic apps. Many platforms provide answers based on a variety of fiqh (jurisprudence) schools.\n\n5. **Continuing with Caution**: If you're unsure, you can still proceed with caution. For example, if you're unsure about the status of dead skin, you could ensure that you perform Wudoo in a way that is likely to fulfill the conditions according to the majority of opinions. If that means being more thorough or cautious in your Wudoo, that's a reasonable approach.\n\nIn your case, if you're unsure whether the dead skin acts as a barrier, you could proceed with the assumption that it's better to be cautious.

The Prophet would say: \"Ma shaa-llah\" (An Arabic maxim meaning literally, What Allah wished, and it indicates a good omen.) One day, he asked us whether anyone of us had seen a dream. We replied in the negative. The Prophet said, \"But I had seen (a dream) last night that two men came to me, caught hold of my hands, and took me to the Sacred Land (Jerusalem). There, I saw a person sitting and another standing with an iron hook in his hand pushing it inside the mouth of the former till it reached the jawbone, and then tore off one side of his cheek, and then did the same with the other side; in the meantime the first side of his cheek became normal again and then he repeated the same operation again. I said, What is this? They told me to proceed on and we went on till we came to a man Lying flat on his back, and another man standing at his head carrying a stone or a piece of rock, and crushing the head of the Lying man, with that stone. Whenever he struck him, the stone rolled away. The man went to pick it up and by the time he returned to him, the crushed head had returned to its normal state and the man came back and struck him again (and so on). I said, Who is this? They told me to proceed on; so we proceeded on and passed by a hole like an oven; with a narrow top and wide bottom, and the fire was kindling underneath that hole. Whenever the fire-flame went up, the people were lifted up to such an extent that they about to get out of it, and whenever the fire got quieter, the people went down into it, and there were naked men and women in it. I said, Who is this? They told me to proceed on. So we proceeded on till we reached a river of blood and a man was in it, and another man was standing at its bank with stones in front of him, facing the man standing in the river. Whenever the man in the river wanted to come out, the other one threw a stone in his mouth and caused him to retreat to his original position; and so whenever he wanted to come out the other would throw a stone in his mouth, and he would retreat to his original position. I asked, What is this? They told me to proceed on and we did so till we reached a well-flourished green garden having a huge tree and near its root was sitting an old man with some children. (I saw) Another man near the tree with fire in front of him and he was kindling it up. Then they (i.e. my two companions) made me climb up the tree and made me enter a house, better than which I have ever seen. In it were some old men and young men, women and children. Then they took me out of this house and made me climb up the tree and made me enter another house that was better and superior (to the first) containing old and young people. I said to them (i.e. my two companions), You have made me ramble all the night. Tell me all about that I have seen. They said, Yes. As for the one whose cheek you saw being torn away, he was a liar and he used to tell lies, and the people would report those lies on his authority till they spread all over the world. So, he will be punished like that till the Day of Resurrection. The one whose head you saw being crushed is the one whom Allah had given the knowledge of Quran (i.e. knowing it by heart) but he used to sleep at night (i.e. he did not recite it then) and did not use to act upon it (i.e. upon its orders etc.) by day; and so this punishment will go on till the Day of Resurrection.

The Quran and Hadith emphasize moderation in spending.\n\nThe Quran states, \"And do not be extravagant; indeed, He does not like those who are extravagant.\" (Surah Al-A'raf, 7:31)\n\nWhen it comes to spending on attars (fragrances) like Oudh, several factors need to be considered:\n\n1. **Intention and Moderation**: If the intention is to enjoy something permissible (halal) and within one's means, it may not be considered extravagant. However, spending beyond one's means or to show off could be viewed as extravagance.\n\n2. **Value and Quality**: High-quality Oudh and attars can be expensive due to factors like the rarity of ingredients, the process of production, and the concentration of the fragrance. If the high price is reflective of the quality and the product is appreciated for its value, it might not be seen as extravagant by some scholars, especially if it's within the person's financial means.\n\n3. **Islamic Perspective on Luxury Items**: Islam does not prohibit the use of luxury items outright but cautions against excess. The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) is reported to have used perfume and considered it a part of his Sunnah. Therefore, using expensive attars, if done with moderation and not as an act of showing off, can be permissible.\n\n4. **Financial Circumstances**: The permissibility also depends on the individual's financial situation. If spending a large amount on attar does not lead to neglect of financial responsibilities (e.g., towards family, debts, or charity), and is within the person's disposable income, it is likely to be viewed more leniently.\n\n5. **Scholarly Views**: Different Islamic scholars may have varying opinions based on their interpretation of Islamic law. Some might view excessive spending on luxury items as a form of extravagance, while others might see it as permissible if done with the right intention and within one's financial capacity.\n\nIn conclusion, while Islam cautions against extravagance, spending on high-quality attars like Oudh can be permissible if done with moderation, within one's means, and without the intention of showing off. It's essential to consider one's financial situation and priorities. If the expenditure does not lead to neglect of other important duties or responsibilities, it may"}

The food served at Fatiha is usually provided by the family or relatives of the deceased.\n\nIn Islam, Fatiha as a ritual is not considered a recommended or permissible practice. The Quran and Hadith do not sanction the practice of Fatiha as it is commonly observed.\n\nAs for eating the food served at Fatiha, the ruling is as follows:\n\n1. **Permissibility of the food itself**: The food served is halal if it is made from halal ingredients and prepared according to Islamic guidelines. The fact that it's served at Fatiha doesn't inherently make it haram.\n\n2. **Intention and context**: If you are invited to eat at someone's house for Fatiha, and you are not directly participating in or endorsing the un-Islamic aspects of the ritual, then eating the food is not necessarily haram. However, it's advisable to avoid participating in such gatherings to the extent possible if they involve practices not condoned by Islam.\n\n3. **Islamic alternative**: Muslims are encouraged to pray for the deceased and to gather for Quran recitation or other religiously-sanctioned activities. If the gathering is for a legitimate Islamic purpose, such as reciting Quran or having a meal to foster community bonding, then it is considered permissible.\n\n4. **Scholarly views**: Some scholars view Fatiha as a form of bid'ah (innovation) because it involves practices not directly endorsed by the Prophet (peace be upon him) or his companions. They advise against participating in or perpetuating such customs.\n\nIn summary, while the food itself is not haram if it's halal, participating in Fatiha is not considered an Islamic practice. If you're invited to such a gathering, your decision to attend or eat the food should be guided by your understanding of the nature of the gathering and your personal beliefs about participating in such events.\n\n---"}

This situation suggests you might be experiencing some form of incontinence or a medical condition leading to the involuntary leakage of fecal matter or discharge.\n\n2. **Islamic Ruling**: In Islamic jurisprudence, issues related to ritual purity and prayer are addressed based on the nature of the discharge. If the discharge is related to stool (like feces or a substance that comes from the same passage), it is considered impure (najaasah). However, the ruling on how to perform your prayers and achieve tahaarat depends on whether this issue is considered a normal ongoing condition (like in the case of someone with continual urine leakage or istihaadhah for women) or an abnormal, uncontrollable situation.\n\n3. **Achieving Tahaarat**: For someone with an ongoing condition like this, the steps to achieve tahaarat for salaah involve:\n   - Performing istinjaa’ (cleaning yourself) after each prayer time by washing the area with water.\n   - Wearing clean clothes for salaah after istinja’.\n   - Applying a suitable barrier or protective garment if possible to prevent the leakage from reaching your clothes.\n   - Ensuring you are in a state of wudhu for salaah.\n\n4. **Performing Salaah**: \n   - You should perform your salaah at its prescribed time.\n   - Before salaah, make sure you've done istinja’, changed into clean clothes (if soiled), and made wudhu.\n   - If the leakage continues, you are still required to perform salaah. The condition might be considered similar to that of a person with continual passing of urine (or other similar conditions), where you make wudhu for the time of salaah and perform your salaah with that wudhu.\n\n5. **Dealing with the Stench**: After istinja’, you can try washing the area with soap or using antiseptic wipes to minimize the odor. Ensuring the area is clean can help.\n\n6. **Medical Advice**: It's crucial to consult a medical professional to diagnose and potentially treat the underlying cause of this condition. There might be a treatable condition causing this issue.\n\n7. **Islamic"}

The primary condition for zakat to be obligatory on any wealth, including jewelry, is that it should be considered part of one's zakatable assets that meet the nisab threshold (the minimum amount of wealth that makes zakat obligatory) and have been in one's possession for a lunar year (hawl).\n\nThere are different views among Islamic scholars on this issue:\n\n1. **View that Zakat is Not Due on Jewelry Used for Wearing**: Some scholars, including some Hanafi and Shafi'i jurists, hold that jewelry used for personal adornment is not subject to zakat, based on the hadith that women were allowed to use jewelry during the Prophet's lifetime without any mention of paying zakat on it. They differentiate between jewelry used for wearing and that kept as a form of savings or investment.\n\n2. **View that Zakat is Due on All Jewelry**: Other scholars, including some Maliki and Hanbali jurists, argue that zakat is due on jewelry regardless of whether it is used for personal adornment or not, as long as it meets the nisab threshold and one lunar year has passed since its possession. They consider jewelry as a form of wealth that is subject to zakat, just like other forms of wealth.\n\n3. **Compromise View**: Some contemporary scholars suggest a compromise, stating that if the jewelry is beyond the customary usage or considered excessive, or if it's kept for savings or investment purposes, then it is subject to zakat.\n\nIn summary, whether zakat is due on women's jewelry depends on the interpretation and the school of thought one follows. It's a complex issue that involves understanding the nuances of Islamic law and its application to different aspects of wealth, including jewelry.\n\nFor a specific ruling, it's advisable to consult with a knowledgeable Islamic scholar or a trusted Islamic authority who can provide guidance based on the individual's circumstances and the prevailing scholarly opinion in their community."}

When sadaqa is given, it is expected to reach those for whom it is intended, such as the poor, orphans, and those in need.\n\nUsing sadaqa meant for orphan Quran students in a meelaad sharif (a gathering to celebrate the birth of the Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him) and serving it to rich people deviates from the original intention of the sadaqa. The primary concern here is that the sadaqa is not being utilized for its intended purpose, which is to benefit the orphans or the needy students.\n\nIslam emphasizes the importance of intention and honesty in charitable giving. The Quran and Hadith stress that charity should be given sincerely and should reach those it is intended for.\n\nIn this context, using the sadaqa for meelaad sharif and serving it to rich people might not align with Islamic principles of charity if the original intention was to benefit the orphans or needy students. It's crucial that the trustees or those in charge of managing the sadaqa ensure it is used in a manner that is consistent with the intentions of the donors and for the benefit of those it is meant for.\n\nIf the orphans or students are in need of the food, and the meelaad sharif is a valid gathering where they can be fed, the context might be different. However, if the sadaqa is being diverted to serve the rich, it would likely be considered inappropriate.\n\nIt's always best to consult with a local Islamic scholar or a knowledgeable person in Islamic jurisprudence for a more precise and context-specific guidance, as the ruling can depend on the specific circumstances and intentions involved."}

Anything that has a worldly or religious purpose or benefit is not blameworthy in the Hanafi school, as scholars and the texts explain. Therefore, if you like to read English literature, this would not be blameworthy (unless it leads, in your case, to something blameworthy) because reading literature has clear benefits. Of course, you would not have reward for these benefits without intending something noble. The same thing would apply to sports if done for recreational purposes, for ones health or to bring brothers together over a lawful activity, as long as they are free of anything blameworthy in the Shariah (such as excessive wasting of time that leads to foregoing ones worldly or religious responsibilities, or swearing, players without their awra covered, etc). Unfortunately, there is often much that is blameworthy in recreational sports these days, so one should be careful", "Document": "It was narrated that Humaid bin Abdur-Rahman said:\"I met a man who accompanied the Prophet () as Abu Hurairah (may Allah be pleased with him), accompanied him for four years. He said: The Messenger of Allah () forbade any one of us to comb his hair each day,[1] or to urinate in the place where he performs Ghusl, or for a man to perform Ghusl using the leftover water of a women, or a woman to perform Ghusl using the leftover water of a man - they should scoop it out together.\"[1] It is said this is to prevent him from making his physical appearance his main aim.<D>Al Miswar bin Makhramah said :The Messenger of Allah () came out in the year of al-Hudaibbiyyah with over ten hundreds of Companions and when he came to Dhu al Hulaifah. He garlanded and marked the sacrificial animals, and entered the sacred state of Umrah. He then went on with the tradition. The Prophet moved on and when he came to the mountain, pass by which one descends (to Mecca) to them, his riding-beast knelt down, and the people said twice: Go on, go on, al-Qaswa has become jaded. The Prophet (May peace be upon him) said: She has not become jaded and that is not a characteristic of hers, but He Who restrained the elephant has restrained her. He then said: By Him in Whose hand my soul is, they will not ask any me good thing by which they honor which God has made sacred without my giving them it. He then urged her and she leaped up and he turned aside from them, and stopped at the farthest side of al-Hudaibiyyah at a pool with little water. Meanwhile Budail bin Warqa al-Khuza’I came, and ‘Urwah bin Mas’ud joined him. He began to speak to the Prophet (). Whenever he spoke to the Prophet (), he caught his beard. Al Mughriah bin Shu’bah was standing beside the Prophet ().He had a sword with him, wearing a helmet. He (Al Mughriah) struck his (‘Urwah’s) hand with the lower end of his sheath, and said: Keep away your hand from his beard. ‘Urwah then raised his hand and asked: Who is this? They replied: Al-Mughirah bin Shu’bah. He said: O treacherous one! Did I not use my offices in your treachery? In pre-Islamic days Al-Mughirah bin Shu’bah accompanied some people and murdered them, and took their property. He then came (to the Prophet) and embraced Islam. The Prophet () said: As for Islam we accepted it, but as to the property, as it has been taken by treachery, we have no need of it. He went on with the tradition the Prophet () said: Write down: This is what Muhammad, the Messenger of Allah, has decided. He then narrated the tradition. Suhail then said: And that a man will not come to you from us, even if he follows your religion, without you sending him back to us. When he finished drawing up the document, the Prophet () said to his Companions: Get up and sacrifice and then shave. Thereafter some believing women who were immigrants came. (Allah sent down: O yea who believe, when believing women come to you as emigrants). Allah most high forbade them to send them back, but ordered them to restore the dower. He then returned to Medina. Abu Basir a man from the Quraish (who was a Muslim), came to him. And they sent (two men) to look for him; so he handed him over to the two men. They took him away, and when they reached Dhu Al Hulaifah and alighted to eat some dates which they had, Abu Basir said to one of the men : I swear by Allah so-and-so, that I think this sword of yours is a fine one; the other drew the sword and said : Yes I have tried it. Abu Basir said: Let me look at it. He let him have it and he struck him till he died, whereupon the other fled and came to Medina, and running entered the mosque. The Prophet ( may peace be upon him) said: This man has seen something frightful. He said: I swear by Allah that my Companion has been killed, and im as good as dead.

The intention behind engaging in these activities can influence their permissibility.\n\n### Permissibility and Conditions\n\nFor an activity to be considered permissible, it must adhere to certain conditions:\n1. **Not Involving Haram Actions**: The activity should not involve actions that are inherently haram, such as immodesty, violence, or gambling.\n2. **Not Leading to Haram Outcomes**: The activity should not lead to outcomes that are considered haram, such as neglecting religious obligations or causing harm to oneself or others.\n3. **Maintaining Modesty and Islamic Ethics**: Participants should maintain modesty and adhere to Islamic ethics, avoiding mixed-gender interactions that could lead to fitnah (temptation) or other haram situations.\n\n### Intention and Its Influence\n\nThe intention behind engaging in physical activities or sports can significantly influence their ruling. For example:\n- **For Physical Health**: Engaging in sports or physical activities with the intention of improving or maintaining physical health is considered commendable (mustahabb) or at least permissible (mubah), as maintaining health is a religious duty.\n- **For Recreation or Socializing**: Participating in sports or physical activities for recreation or to socialize with friends is generally permissible, provided the activities and the environment comply with Islamic guidelines.\n- **For Showing Off or Pride**: If the intention is to show off or foster pride, the activity becomes disapproved (makruh) or potentially haram if it leads to arrogance.\n\n### Reading Fictional Novels as a Hobby\n\nRegarding reading fictional novels as a hobby or to pass time, the Hanafi madhab's stance can be nuanced:\n- **Content Matters**: The content of the novels is crucial. Novels that contain kufr (disbelief), promote haram values, or include explicit content are not permissible.\n- **Impact on Faith and Behavior**: If reading such novels leads to a weakening of faith or promotes un-Islamic values and behaviors, it is considered disapproved or haram.\n- **Permissible Content**: Reading novels that are free from haram content and do not lead to neglecting religious duties or adopting un-Islamic behaviors is generally viewed as permissible.

{"Question": "Answered by Shaykh Ilyas PatelI have a huge problem concerning brotherhood in Islam. I started practicing in my teen years and day by day MashAllah my deen goes up. I just found out that a brother I know for long time is talking behind my back and he and some other people judge for the way I dress, walk, and talk. They are always trying to bring me down. In fact it seems they hate me deep inside just because the way I am. I feel depressed and it hurts me, brothers judging other brothers outwardly. What should I do? And what does Islam say about backbiting.? --T--", "Answer": "In the Name of Allah, Most Merciful and CompassionateThese brothers who are judging you outwardly is because of their lack of iman and understanding, though they know it is wrong to backbite. They havent come to realise its severity. It is good of you being concerned and wanting them to like you as you are, but this is not the case all the time. You can be judged wrongly even if you are like them. Try to dress in western clothing also and be as normal as you are, in order to show your friends that you are no different when you wear what they are wearing. Also a good way to make them closer is to give gifts. On the other hand, if they are completely off the track and affecting your din then you should try to avoid them and pray to Allah to guide them and keep you steadfast, but keep ties with them by meeting them occasionally or by giving gifts.Ghiba (Backbiting and slander) is a major sin and is a very common ailment in our society. It means to mention anything concerning a person that he would dislike, whether about his body, religion, everyday life, self, disposition, property, son, father, wife, servant, turban, garment, gait Allah clearly mentions in the Quran:Woe to whoever disparages others behind their back or to their face(Koran 104:1)There are other verses and ahadith against backbiting.May Allah save us all from this evil, amin", "Document": "Narrated Aisha:(The wife of the Prophet) Whenever Allahs Apostle intended to go on a journey, he used to draw lots among his wives and would take with him the one on whom the lot had fallen. Once he drew lots when he wanted to carry out a Ghazwa, and the lot came upon me. So I proceeded with Allahs Apostle after Allahs order of veiling (the women) had been revealed and thus I was carried in my howdah (on a camel) and dismounted while still in it. We carried on our journey, and when Allahs Apostle had finished his Ghazwa and returned and we approached Medina, Allahs Apostle ordered to proceed at night. When the army was ordered to resume the homeward journey, I got up and walked on till I left the army (camp) behind. When I had answered the call of nature, I went towards my howdah, but behold ! A necklace of mine made of Jaz Azfar (a kind of black bead) was broken and I looked for it and my search for it detained me. The group of people who used to carry me, came and carried my howdah on to the back of my camel on which I was riding, considering that I was therein. At that time women were light in weight and were not fleshy for they used to eat little (food), so those people did not feel the lightness of the howdah while raising it up, and I was still a young lady. They drove away the camel and proceeded. Then I found my necklace after the army had gone. I came to their camp but found nobody therein so I went to the place where I used to stay, thinking that they would miss me and come back in my search. While I was sitting at my place, I felt sleepy and slept. Safwan bin Al-Muattil As-Sulami Adh- Dhakw-ani was behind the army. He had started in the last part of the night and reached my stationing place in the morning and saw the figure of a sleeping person. He came to me and recognized me on seeing me for he used to see me before veiling. I got up because of his saying: \"Inna Li l-lahi wa inna ilaihi rajiun,\" which he uttered on recognizing me. I covered my face with my garment, and by Allah, he did not say to me a single word except, \"Inna Li l-lahi wa inna ilaihi rajiun,\" till he made his shecamel kneel down whereupon he trod on its forelegs and I mounted it. Then Safwan set out, leading the she-camel that was carrying me, till we met the army while they were resting during the hot midday. Then whoever was meant for destruction, fell in destruction, and the leader of the Ifk (forged statement) was `Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul. After this we arrived at Medina and I became ill for one month while the people were spreading the forged statements of the people of the Ifk, and I was not aware of anything thereof. But what aroused my doubt while I was sick, was that I was no longer receiving from Allahs Apostle the same kindness as I used to receive when I fell sick. Allahs Apostle would enter upon me, say a greeting and add, \"How is that (lady)?\" and then depart. That aroused my suspicion but I was not aware of the propagated evil till I recovered from my ailment. I went out with Um Mistah to answer the call of nature towards Al-Manasi, the place where we used to relieve ourselves, and used not to go out for this purpose except from night to night, and that was before we had lavatories close to our houses. And this habit of ours was similar to the habit of the old Arabs (in the deserts or in the tents) concerning the evacuation of the bowels, for we considered it troublesome and harmful to take lavatories in the houses. So I went out with Um Mistah who was the daughter of Abi Ruhm bin `Abd Manaf, and her mother was daughter of Sakhr bin Amir who was the aunt of Abi Bakr As-Siddiq, and her son was Mistah bin Uthatha. When we had finished our affair, Um Mistah and I came back towards my house. Um Mistah stumbled over her robe whereupon she said, \"Let Mistah be ruined ! \" I said to her, \"What a bad word you have said! Do you abuse a man who has taken part in the Battle of Badr? She said, \"O you there! Didnt you hear what he has said?\" I said, \"And what did he say?\" She then told me the statement of the people of the Ifk (forged statement) which added to my ailment. When I returned home, Allahs Apostle came to me, and after greeting, he said, \"How is that (lady)?\" I said, \"Will you allow me to go to my parents?\" At that time I intended to be sure of the news through them. Allahs Apostle allowed me and I went to my parents and asked my mother, \"O my mother! What are the people talking about?\" My mother said, \"O my daughter! Take it easy, for by Allah, there is no charming lady who is loved by her husband who has other wives as well, but that those wives would find fault with her.\" I said, \"Subhan Allah! Did the people really talk about that?\" That night I kept on weeping the whole night till the morning. My tears never stopped, nor did I sleep, and morning broke while I was still weeping, Allahs Apostle called `Ali bin Abi Talib and Usama bin Zaid when the Divine Inspiration delayed, in order to consult them as to the idea of divorcing his wife. Usama bin Zaid told Allahs Apostle of what he knew about the innocence of his wife and of his affection he kept for her. He said, \"O Allahs Apostle! She is your wife, and we do not know anything about her except good.\" But `Ali bin Abi Talib said, \"O Allahs Apostle! Allah does not impose restrictions on you; and there are plenty of women other than her. If you however, ask (her) slave girl, she will tell you the truth.\" `Aisha added: So Allahs Apostle called for Barira and said, \"O Barira! Did you ever see anything which might have aroused your suspicion? (as regards Aisha). Barira said, \"By Allah Who has sent you with the truth, I have never seen anything regarding Aisha which I would blame her for except that she is a girl of immature age who sometimes sleeps and leaves the dough of her family unprotected so that the domestic goats come and eat it.\" So Allahs Apostle got up (and addressed) the people an asked for somebody who would take revenge on `Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul then. Allahs Apostle, while on the pulpit, said, \"O Muslims! Who will help me against a man who has hurt me by slandering my family? By Allah, I know nothing except good about my family, and people have blamed a man of whom I know nothing except good, and he never used to visit my family except with me,\" Sa`d bin Mu`adh Al-Ansari got up and said, \"O Allahs Apostle! By Allah, I will relieve you from him. If he be from the tribe of (Bani) Al-Aus, then I will chop his head off; and if he be from our brethren, the Khazraj, then you give us your order and we will obey it.\" On that, Sa`d bin Ubada got up, and he was the chief of the Khazraj, and before this incident he had been a pious man but he was incited by his zeal for his tribe. He said to Sa`d (bin Mu`adh), \"By Allah the Eternal, you have told a lie! You shall not kill him and you will never be able to kill him!\" On that, Usaid bin Hudair, the cousin of Sa`d (bin Mu`adh) got up and said to Sa`d bin Ubada, \"You are a liar! By Allah the Eternal, we will surely kill him; and you are a hypocrite defending the hypocrites!\" So the two tribes of Al-Aus and Al-Khazraj got excited till they were on the point of fighting with each other while Allahs Apostle was standing on the pulpit. Allahs Apostle continued quietening them till they became silent whereupon he became silent too. On that day I kept on weeping so much that neither did my tears stop, nor could I sleep. In the morning my parents were with me, and I had wept for two nights and a day without sleeping and with incessant tears till they thought that my liver would burst with weeping. While they were with me and I was weeping, an Ansari woman asked permission to see me. I admitted her and she sat and started weeping with me. While I was in that state, Allahs Apostle came to us, greeted, and sat down,. He had never sat with me since the day what was said, was said. He had stayed a month without receiving any Divine Inspiration concerning my case. Allahs Apostle recited the Tashahhud after he had sat down, and then said, \"Thereafter, O `Aisha! I have been informed such and-such a thing about you; and if you are innocent, Allah will reveal your innocence, and if you have committed a sin, then ask for Allahs forgiveness and repent to Him, for when a slave confesses his sin and then repents to Allah, Allah accepts his repentance.\" When Allahs Apostle had finished his speech, my tears ceased completely so that I no longer felt even a drop thereof. Then I said to my father, \"Reply to Allahs Apostle on my behalf as to what he said.\" He said, \"By Allah, I do not know what to say to Allahs Apostle.\" Then I said to my mother, \"Reply to Allahs Apostle.\" She said, \"I do not know what to say to Allahs Apostle.\" Still a young girl as I was and though I had little knowledge of Quran, I said, \"By Allah, I know that you heard this story (of the Ifk) so much so that it has been planted in your minds and you have believed it. So now, if I tell you that I am innocent, and Allah knows that I am innocent, you will not believe me; and if I confess something, and Allah knows that I am innocent of it, you will believe me. By Allah, I cannot find of you an example except that of Josephs father: \"So (for me) patience is most fitting against that which you assert and it is Allah (Alone) Whose help can be sought. Then I turned away and lay on my bed, and at that time I knew that I was innocent and that Allah would reveal my innocence. But by Allah, I never thought that Allah would sent down about my affair, Divine Inspiration that would be recited (forever), as I considered myself too unworthy to be talked of by Allah with something that was to be recited: but I hoped that Allahs Apostle might have a vision in which Allah would prove my innocence. By Allah, Allahs Apostle had not left his seat and nobody had left the house when the Divine Inspiration came to Allahs Apostle . So there overtook him the same hard condition which used to overtake him (when he was Divinely Inspired) so that the drops of his sweat were running down, like pearls, though it was a (cold) winter day, and that was because of the heaviness of the Statement which was revealed to him. When that state of Allahs Apostle was over, and he was smiling when he was relieved, the first word he said was, \"Aisha, Allah has declared your innocence.\" My mother said to me, \"Get up and go to him.\" I said, \"By Allah, I will not go to him and I will not thank anybody but Allah.\" So Allah revealed: \"Verily! They who spread the Slander are a gang among you. Think it not....\" (24.11-20). When Allah revealed this to confirm my innocence, Abu Bakr As-Siddiq who used to provide for Mistah bin Uthatha because of the latters kinship to him and his poverty, said, \"By Allah, I will never provide for Mistah anything after what he has said about Aisha\". So Allah revealed: (continued...) (continuing... 1): -6.274:... ... \"Let not those among you who are good and are wealthy swear not to give (help) to their kinsmen, those in need, and those who have left their homes for Allahs Cause. Let them Pardon and forgive (i.e. do not punish them). Do you not love that should forgive you? Verily Allah is Oft-forgiving. Most Merciful.\" (24.22) Abu Bakr said, \"Yes, by Allah, I wish that Allah should forgive me.\" So he resumed giving Mistah the aid he used to give him before and said, \"By Allah, I will never withold it from him at all.\" Aisha further said: Allahs Apostle also asked Zainab bint Jahsh about my case. He said, \"O Zainab! What have you seen?\" She replied, \"O Allahs Apostle! I protect my hearing and my sight (by refraining from telling lies). I know nothing but good (about Aisha).\" Of all the wives of Allahs Apostle, it was Zainab who aspired to receive from him the same favor as I used to receive, yet, Allah saved her (from telling lies) because of her piety. But her sister, Hamna, kept on fighting on her behalf so she was destroyed as were those who invented and spread the slander.<D>Narrated Anas bin Malik:That when Haram bin Milhan, his uncle was stabbed on the day of Bir Mauna he sprinkled his blood over his face and his head this way and then said, \"I have succeeded, by the Lord of the Ka`ba.<D>Narrated Aisha:(the wife of the Prophet) \"Whenever Allahs Apostle intended to go on a journey, he would draw lots amongst his wives and would take with him the one upon whom the lot fell. During a Ghazwa of his, he drew lots amongst us and the lot fell upon me, and I proceeded with him after Allah had decreed the use of the veil by women. I was carried in a Howdah (on the camel) and dismounted while still in it. When Allahs Apostle was through with his Ghazwa and returned home, and we approached the city of Medina, Allahs Apostle ordered us to proceed at night. When the order of setting off was given, I walked till I was past the army to answer the call of nature. After finishing I returned (to the camp) to depart (with the others) and suddenly realized that my necklace over my chest was missing. So, I returned to look for it and was delayed because of that. The people who used to carry me on the camel, came to my Howdah and put it on the back of the camel, thinking that I was in it, as, at that time, women were light in weight, and thin and lean, and did not use to eat much. So, those people did not feel the difference in the heaviness of the Howdah while lifting it, and they put it over the camel. At that time I was a young lady. They set the camel moving and proceeded on. I found my necklace after the army had gone, and came to their camp to find nobody. So, I went to the place where I used to stay, thinking that they would discover my absence and come back in my search. While in that state, I felt sleepy and slept. Safwan bin Muattal As-Sulami Adh-Dhakwani was behind the army and reached my abode in the morning. When he saw a sleeping person, he came to me, and he used to see me before veiling. So, I got up when I heard him saying, \"Inna lil-lah-wa inn a ilaihi rajiun (We are for Allah, and we will return to Him).\" He made his camel knell down. He got down from his camel, and put his leg on the front legs of the camel and then I rode and sat over it. Safwan set out walking, leading the camel by the rope till we reached the army who had halted to take rest at midday. Then whoever was meant for destruction, fell into destruction, (some people accused me falsely) and the leader of the false accusers was `Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul. After that we returned to Medina, and I became ill for one month while the people were spreading the forged statements of the false accusers. I was feeling during my ailment as if I were not receiving the usual kindness from the Prophet which I used to receive from him when I got sick. But he would come, greet and say, How is that (girl)? I did not know anything of what was going on till I recovered from my ailment and went out with Um Mistah to the Manasi where we used to answer the call of nature, and we used not to go to answer the call of nature except from night to night and that was before we had lavatories near to our houses. And this habit of ours was similar to the habit of the old Arabs in the open country (or away from houses). So. I and Um Mistah bint Ruhm went out walking. Um Mistah stumbled because of her long dress and on that she said, Let Mistah be ruined. I said, You are saying a bad word. Why are you abusing a man who took part in (the battle of) Badr? She said, O Hanata (you there) didnt you hear what they said? Then she told me the rumors of the false accusers. My sickness was aggravated, and when I returned home, Allahs Apostle came to me, and after greeting he said, How is that (girl)? I requested him to allow me to go to my parents. I wanted then to be sure of the news through them I Allahs Apostle allowed me, and I went to my parents and asked my mother, What are the people talking about? She said, O my daughter! Dont worry much about this matter. By Allah, never is there a charming woman loved by her husband who has other wives, but the women would forge false news about her. I said, Glorified be Allah! Are the people really taking of this matter? That night I kept on weeping and could not sleep till morning. In the morning Allahs Apostle called `Ali bin Abu Talib and Usama bin Zaid when he saw the Divine Inspiration delayed, to consul them about divorcing his wife (i.e. `Aisha). Usama bin Zaid said what he knew of the good reputation of his wives and added, O Allahs Apostle! Keep you wife, for, by Allah, we know nothing about her but good. `Ali bin Abu Talib said, O Allahs Apostle! Allah has no imposed restrictions on you, and there are many women other than she, yet you may ask the woman-servant who will tell you the truth. On that Allahs Apostle called Buraira and said, O Burair. Did you ever see anything which roused your suspicions about her? Buraira said, No, by Allah Who has sent you with the Truth, I have never seen in her anything faulty except that she is a girl of immature age, who sometimes sleeps and leaves the dough for the goats to eat. On that day Allahs Apostle ascended the pulpit and requested that somebody support him in punishing `Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul. Allahs Apostle said, Who will support me to punish that person (`Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul) who has hurt me by slandering the reputation of my family? By Allah, I know nothing about my family but good, and they have accused a person about whom I know nothing except good, and he never entered my house except in my company. Sa`d bin Mu`adh got up and said, O Allahs Apostle! by Allah, I will relieve you from him. If that man is from the tribe of the Aus, then we will chop his head off, and if he is from our brothers, the Khazraj, then order us, and we will fulfill your order. On that Sa`d bin Ubada, the chief of the Khazraj and before this incident, he had been a pious man, got up, motivated by his zeal for his tribe and said, By Allah, you have told a lie; you cannot kill him, and you will never be able to kill him. On that Usaid bin Al-Hadir got up and said (to Sa`d bin Ubada), By Allah! you are a liar. By Allah, we will kill him; and you are a hypocrite, defending the hypocrites. On this the two tribes of Aus and Khazraj got excited and were about to fight each other, while Allahs Apostle was standing on the pulpit. He got down and quieted them till they became silent and he kept quiet. On that day I kept on weeping so much so that neither did my tears stop, nor could I sleep. In the morning my parents were with me and I had wept for two nights and a day, till I thought my liver would burst from weeping. While they were sitting with me and I was weeping, an Ansari woman asked my permission to enter, and I allowed her to come in. She sat down and started weeping with me. While we were in this state, Allahs Apostle came and sat down and he had never sat with me since the day they forged the accusation. No revelation regarding my case came to him for a month. He recited Tashah-hud (i.e. None has the right to be worshipped but Allah and Muhammad is His Apostle) and then said, O `Aisha! I have been informed such-and-such about you; if you are innocent, then Allah will soon reveal your innocence, and if you have committed a sin, then repent to Allah and ask Him to forgive you, for when a person confesses his sin and asks Allah for forgiveness, Allah accepts his repentance. When Allahs Apostle finished his speech my tears ceased completely and there remained not even a single drop of it. I requested my father to reply to Allahs Apostle on my behalf. My father said, By Allah, I do not know what to say to Allahs Apostle. I said to my mother, Talk to Allahs Apostle on my behalf. She said, By Allah, I do not know what to say to Allahs Apostle. I was a young girl and did not have much knowledge of the Quran. I said. I know, by Allah, that you have listened to what people are saying and that has been planted in your minds and you have taken it as a truth. Now, if I told you that I am innocent and Allah knows that I am innocent, you would not believe me and if I confessed to you falsely that I am guilty, and Allah knows that I am innocent you would believe me. By Allah, I dont compare my situation with you except to the situation of Josephs father (i.e. Jacob) who said, So (for me) patience is most fitting against that which you assert and it is Allah (Alone) whose help can be sought. Then I turned to the other side of my bed hoping that Allah would prove my innocence. By Allah I never thought that Allah would reveal Divine Inspiration in my case, as I considered myself too inferior to be talked of in the Holy Quran. I had hoped that Allahs Apostle might have a dream in which Allah would prove my innocence. By Allah, Allahs Apostle had not got up and nobody had left the house before the Divine Inspiration came to Allahs Apostle. So, there overtook him the same state which used to overtake him, (when he used to have, on being inspired divinely). He was sweating so much so that the drops of the sweat were dropping like pearls though it was a (cold) wintry day. When that state of Allahs Apostle was over, he was smiling and the first word he said, `Aisha! Thank Allah, for Allah has declared your innocence. My mother told me to go to Allahs Apostle . I replied, By Allah I will not go to him and will not thank but Allah. So Allah revealed: \"Verily! They who spread the slander are a gang among you . . .\" (24.11) When Allah gave the declaration of my Innocence, Abu Bakr, who used to provide for Mistah bin Uthatha for he was his relative, said, By Allah, I will never provide Mistah with anything because of what he said about Aisha. But Allah later revealed: -- \"And let not those who are good and wealthy among you swear not to help their kinsmen, those in need and those who left their homes in Allahs Cause. Let them forgive and overlook. Do you not wish that Allah should forgive you? Verily! Allah is Oft-forgiving, Most Merciful.\" (24.22) After that Abu Bakr said, Yes ! By Allah! I like that Allah should forgive me, and resumed helping Mistah whom he used to help before. Allahs Apostle also asked Zainab bint Jahsh (i.e. the Prophets wife about me saying, What do you know and what did you see? She replied, O Allahs Apostle! I refrain to claim hearing or seeing what I have not heard or seen. By Allah, I know nothing except goodness about Aisha.\" Aisha further added \"Zainab was competing with me (in her beauty and the Prophets love), yet Allah protected her (from being malicious), for she had piety.\"<D>And from his narration on the authority of Ibn Abbas that he said regarding the interpretation of Allahs saying (Those who disbelieve): (Those who disbelieve) in Muhammad (pbuh) and the Quran (and turn (men) from the way of Allah) and prevent people from the religion and obedience of Allah-the reference here is to those who fed the army of the disbelievers on the Day of Badr: Utbah and Shaybah the sons of Rabiah, Munbih and Nabih the sons of al-Hajjaj, Abul-Buhturi Ibn Hisham and Abu Jahl Ibn Hisham and their host-, (He rendereth their actions vain) He thwarts their good deeds and spending on the Day of Badr.<D>((And it was said unto him): O David!

I understand your concern and the hurt you're feeling, and insha'Allah, I'll provide you with the Islamic perspective and advice on how to handle this situation.\n\nFirstly, let's address the issue of backbiting. The Quran and Hadith are replete with warnings against backbiting. In the Quran, Allah says, \"O you who believe! Avoid much suspicion, indeed some suspicions are sinful. And do not spy, nor backbite one another. Would one of you like to eat the flesh of his dead brother? You would detest it. And fear Allah, indeed Allah is Accepting of repentance, Most Merciful.\" (Quran 49:12)\n\nThe Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) also emphasized the gravity of backbiting. He said, \"Do you know what backbiting is?\" They said, \"Allah and His Messenger know best.\" He said, \"It is to say something about your brother that he dislikes.\" It was said, \"What if what I say is true about my brother?\" The Prophet (peace be upon him) said, \"If what you say about him is true, then you have backbitten him, and if it is not true, then you have slandered him.\" (Sahih Muslim)\n\nNow, regarding your situation, my advice is as follows:\n\n1. **Don't take it to heart**: Understand that people's opinions about you are often a reflection of their own selves, not yours. Try not to internalize their negative comments or let them affect your self-worth.\n\n2. **Reflect on your actions**: While it's not your fault that others are talking about you, it's worth reflecting if there's anything in your behavior or dress that's unintentionally causing offense or drawing unnecessary attention. Make adjustments if you feel it's necessary and aligns with your values.\n\n3. **Maintain your integrity**: Continue on your path of practicing Islam as you have been. Don't let the opinions of others deter you from your commitment to your faith.\n\n4. **Address the issue (if necessary)**: If you feel comfortable, you can approach the brother who is talking behind your back and have a calm, respectful conversation about how his actions are affecting you. Sometimes, people are not aware of the impact of their words.\n\n5. **Surround yourself with positivity**: Focus on the company of those who encourage and support you in your faith journey. Positive influences can help counteract the negative"}
{"Question": "Q: Is chewing gum halaal or haraam? I have come to know that chewing gum is made up of pig fat.

{"Question": "I read somewhere that the Beloved Prophet (peace be upon him) used to put oil in his hair, so much so that his clothes/turban would become oily. Was this olive oil that he used? If one rubs olive oil into the hair and scalp for its healthy benefit, is doing wudu over oil-covered hair, and subsequent salat valid? ? --T--", "Answer": "Assalamu alaykum Oil normally soaks very quickly into the hair and becomes absorbed through the scalp. It does not necessarily coat the hair. In dry climates, many people apply oil their hair to protect it from dryness and to gain some coolness. The oil penetrates the hair and scalp and disappears quickly. Therefore, it is permissible to make masah (pass a wetted hand) over oiled hair, unless an excessive amount has been used, in which case one can wait for a short while before making wudu or perform wudu before applying the oil. The Messenger of Allah (upon him be peace) has recommended the use of olive oil, both in cooking and in applying to the body and hair (Shamail Tirmidhi). Shaykh Zakariyya Kandhlawi, in his commentary on this hadith, states that the Messengers (upon him be peace) recommending it means that he possibly used it himself. ", "Document": "Urwa b. Zubair reported on the authority of Aisha, the wife of Allahs Apostle (may peace be upon him), that she said:Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) died (in a state) that it never happened that he could eat to his fill the bread with olive oil twice during a day.<D>It wasnarrated from Ibn ‘Umar that the Prophet () used to put oilonhis head when he was in the state of Ihram, but not oil that wasperfumed.<D>Qatadah narrated from Abu Abdullah that Zaid bin Arqam said:\"The Prophet (S.A.W) would acclaim oil and Wars for (the treatment of) pleurisy.\" Qatadah said: \"And it is put in the mouth on the side which he is suffering. \"<D>Allah then mentioned the honour and blessings that He had bestowed upon the believers, saying: (Allah is the Light of the heavens and the earth) He is the guide of the dwellers of the heaves and earth. Guidance from Allah is of two types: clarification and making things known; it is also said that the verse means: Allah is the embellisher of the heavens by means of the stars and the embellisher of the earth by means of plants and water; it is also said that this means: Allah enlightens the hearts of the believers among the dwellers of the heavens and the earth. (The similitude of His light) the light of the believers; it is also said that this means: the light of Allah in the heart of the believer (is as a niche wherein is a lamp. The lamp is in a glass) made of gems. (The glass is as it were a shining star) one of the following five planets: Mercury, Jupiter, Venus, Mars and Saturn. All these planets are luminous. ((This lamp is) kindled from a blessed tree) from the oil of a blessed tree, (an olive neither of the East nor of the West) in an open space, not touched by the shade of the East nor by the shade of the West; it is also said that this means: in a location which isuntouched by the sun when it rises and when it sets, (whose oil) the oil of the tree (would almost glow forth(of itself)) from behind its rind (though no fire touched it. Light upon light) the lamp emits light and the glass emits light and the oil emits light, (Allah guideth unto His light) Allah honours with knowledge; it isalso said that this means: Allah honours with His religion (whom He will) whoever deserves it; it is also said that the verse means: the likeness of the light of Muhammad in the loins of his forefathers is like this, up to Allahs saying ( kindled from a blessed tree). He says: the light of Muhammad in Abraham was an upright religion (olive tree), and Abraham was neither Jew nor Christian (neither of the East nor of the West), the works of Abraham would almost glow forth in the loins of his forefathers like this (would almost glow forth (of itself)), up until Allahs saying (kindled from a blessed tree) He says: as if it is the light of Muhammad (pbuh) and if Abraham was not a prophet, he would still have this light (though no fire touched it); it is also said that the latter passage means: Had Allah not honoured Abraham, he would not have had this light; it is also said: if Allah had not honoured His believing servant with this light, he would not have had it. (AndAllah speaketh to mankind in allegories) in this way does Allah show to people the trait of knowledge, (for Allah is knower of all things) regarding the honour He bestows upon His servants. Allah struck this similitude of knowledge and clarified its benefit and its praiseworthiness in order that they give thanks to it. Allah says here that just as one uses a lamp to find his way in the dark, so is the light of knowledge used for ones guidance; and just as one uses the stars and planets to find ones way in the darkness of the seas and land, one also uses the light of knowledge for guidance in the darkness of disbelief and idolatry; and just as theoil of a lamp is taken from the blessed olive tree, so too is knowledge from Allah, Exalted is He, for His servant; and just as the olive tree is neither from the East nor from the West, so too is the believer an upright Muslim, neither Jew nor Christian; and just as the oil of the olive tree would almost glow forth of itself even when no fire touches it, so too the faith of the believer is praiseworthy even when there are no virtuous works to accompany it; and just as the niche and the glass and the lamp are light upon light, so too is knowledge light, and the heart of the believer is light and his chest is light and his incoming is light andhis outgoing is light: light upon light; and Allah honours with this light whomever He wills. Such is Allahs description of knowledge.<D>And a tree) and by means of water a tree grows, this refers to the olive tree (that springeth forth from Mount Sinai) that springs forth from the mountain which is covered with trees (that groweth oil and relish for the eaters.<D>Of the fuel-fed fire) slandered were the owners of the ditch; it is also said that they were believers who were killed by the disbelievers by means of fire in which they threw naphtha, oil and firewood,", "Generated_Answer": "The Hadiths mention that the Prophet (peace be upon him) used to take great care of his hair and used oil to groom it. While the specific type of oil is not always mentioned, it is commonly understood to be olive oil or other natural oils available at the time. The practice of using oil on hair was not just for grooming but also for health and hygiene.\n\nAs for the validity of wudu (ablution) and subsequent salat (prayer) when there is oil on the hair, Islamic jurisprudence provides some guidance. The primary concern in wudu is ensuring that water reaches the required parts of the body. For the hair, the requirement is that the water should reach the hair and the scalp.\n\nIf the oil forms a barrier that prevents water from reaching the hair or scalp, then it could potentially invalidate wudu, depending on the school of thought one follows. However, if the oil does not prevent water from penetrating to the scalp, then wudu is considered valid.\n\n- **Hanafi School**: They generally hold that if there's a substance on the body that prevents water from reaching the skin (such as a thick layer of oil), wudu is not valid unless that substance is removed. However, a small amount that doesn't prevent water from reaching the skin is forgiven.\n\n- **Shafi'i and Maliki Schools**: They might have slightly different criteria, but generally, they also emphasize the importance of water reaching the skin.\n\n- **Hanbali School**: They tend to be more lenient regarding substances like oil, but still, the key is whether the water can reach the skin.\n\nFor most people, applying a moderate amount of olive oil or any hair oil wouldn't necessarily form an impenetrable barrier. If you are concerned, you can take a small amount of water and check if it reaches your scalp.\n\nTo be on the safe side, one could:\n\n1. Use a small amount of oil that is less likely to form a significant barrier.\n2. Ensure that during wudu, water is thoroughly applied to the hair and scalp.\n\nIn your case, rubbing olive oil into your hair and scalp for its health benefits is a good practice. For your wudu and salat to be valid, make sure that during wudu, you ensure water reaches your scalp. If you've used a generous amount of oil, you might consider washing it off before wudu or being particularly thorough in ensuring water penetrates to the scalp.\n\nIn summary, using olive oil on your hair is a commendable practice for its health benefits,"}

They might be able to help you by sterilizing the dogs, relocating them, or finding other solutions.\n\n4.  **Community Mediation**: If you believe your neighbors have intentionally encouraged the stray dogs to stay near your home to upset you, it might be helpful to try to resolve the issue amicably. You could consider mediation or talking to your neighbors about the issue.\n\n5.  **Safety Measures**: In the meantime, you could consider taking safety measures to protect your children, such as supervising them when they are outside, installing a fence, or other barriers to prevent the dogs from entering your property. You may want to consult a vet to determine if the dogs are rabid. If they are rabid, then you need to take extra precautions. \n\nWhile your concerns are valid, there are ways to address this issue that do not involve harming animals. You could explore these options to find a solution that is both legal and ethical."}
{"Question": "A friend of mine has recently started wearing a scarf, and she came to me today to talk to me a about how she really feels now that she is wearing it. At first she was so strong and liberated, and I was so proud. But now she is staring to question why she actually has to wear it. And not only that, she was even thinking well is it that bad if she decides to take it off. She went away recently with her sister and she was so tempted to go clubbing. Now I dont know how to reassure her. I tried my best. But I find it hard. I dont know how to reassure her. Because when she was strong I felt empowered in a way and strong myself. But now I feel so confused. Its probably really hard to understand what Im trying to say. Im confused. Can you help me? ? --T--", "Answer": "Wa Alaykum Assalam wa Rahmatullah wa Barakatuhu, In the Name of Allah, Most Merciful & CompassionateThe company we keep is critical to our own spiritual development. It would be of benefit to this sister if you would spend time with her and keep her in the company of other righteous sisters.From Shaykh Nuhs excellent article (link to full text below):Say to believing women, that they cast down their eyes and guard their private parts, and reveal not their adornment save such as is outward; and let them drape their headcoverings over their bosoms, and not reveal their adornment . . . (Quran 24:31) This is why Muslim women cover their heads: because the Quran unambiguously orders them to, and there is no qualifying text or hadith or even other lexical possibility to show that the Quranic order might mean anything besides obligation. Rather, the hadiths all bear this meaning out, Muslim scholars are in unanimous agreement about it and have been from the time of the Prophet (Allah bless him and give him peace) down to our own day, and it is even known by all non-Muslim peoples about them . Please see the following links related to your question about wearing hijab: Why Hijab?By Shaykh Nuh Ha Mim KellerThe Islamic Veil or Hijabjannah", "Document": "Narrated Aisha:(The wife of the Prophet) Whenever Allahs Apostle intended to go on a journey, he used to draw lots among his wives and would take with him the one on whom the lot had fallen. Once he drew lots when he wanted to carry out a Ghazwa, and the lot came upon me. So I proceeded with Allahs Apostle after Allahs order of veiling (the women) had been revealed and thus I was carried in my howdah (on a camel) and dismounted while still in it. We carried on our journey, and when Allahs Apostle had finished his Ghazwa and returned and we approached Medina, Allahs Apostle ordered to proceed at night. When the army was ordered to resume the homeward journey, I got up and walked on till I left the army (camp) behind. When I had answered the call of nature, I went towards my howdah, but behold ! A necklace of mine made of Jaz Azfar (a kind of black bead) was broken and I looked for it and my search for it detained me. The group of people who used to carry me, came and carried my howdah on to the back of my camel on which I was riding, considering that I was therein. At that time women were light in weight and were not fleshy for they used to eat little (food), so those people did not feel the lightness of the howdah while raising it up, and I was still a young lady. They drove away the camel and proceeded. Then I found my necklace after the army had gone. I came to their camp but found nobody therein so I went to the place where I used to stay, thinking that they would miss me and come back in my search. While I was sitting at my place, I felt sleepy and slept. Safwan bin Al-Muattil As-Sulami Adh- Dhakw-ani was behind the army. He had started in the last part of the night and reached my stationing place in the morning and saw the figure of a sleeping person. He came to me and recognized me on seeing me for he used to see me before veiling. I got up because of his saying: \"Inna Li l-lahi wa inna ilaihi rajiun,\" which he uttered on recognizing me. I covered my face with my garment, and by Allah, he did not say to me a single word except, \"Inna Li l-lahi wa inna ilaihi rajiun,\" till he made his shecamel kneel down whereupon he trod on its forelegs and I mounted it. Then Safwan set out, leading the she-camel that was carrying me, till we met the army while they were resting during the hot midday. Then whoever was meant for destruction, fell in destruction, and the leader of the Ifk (forged statement) was `Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul. After this we arrived at Medina and I became ill for one month while the people were spreading the forged statements of the people of the Ifk, and I was not aware of anything thereof. But what aroused my doubt while I was sick, was that I was no longer receiving from Allahs Apostle the same kindness as I used to receive when I fell sick. Allahs Apostle would enter upon me, say a greeting and add, \"How is that (lady)?\" and then depart. That aroused my suspicion but I was not aware of the propagated evil till I recovered from my ailment. I went out with Um Mistah to answer the call of nature towards Al-Manasi, the place where we used to relieve ourselves, and used not to go out for this purpose except from night to night, and that was before we had lavatories close to our houses. And this habit of ours was similar to the habit of the old Arabs (in the deserts or in the tents) concerning the evacuation of the bowels, for we considered it troublesome and harmful to take lavatories in the houses. So I went out with Um Mistah who was the daughter of Abi Ruhm bin `Abd Manaf, and her mother was daughter of Sakhr bin Amir who was the aunt of Abi Bakr As-Siddiq, and her son was Mistah bin Uthatha. When we had finished our affair, Um Mistah and I came back towards my house. Um Mistah stumbled over her robe whereupon she said, \"Let Mistah be ruined ! \" I said to her, \"What a bad word you have said! Do you abuse a man who has taken part in the Battle of Badr? She said, \"O you there! Didnt you hear what he has said?\" I said, \"And what did he say?\" She then told me the statement of the people of the Ifk (forged statement) which added to my ailment. When I returned home, Allahs Apostle came to me, and after greeting, he said, \"How is that (lady)?\" I said, \"Will you allow me to go to my parents?\" At that time I intended to be sure of the news through them. Allahs Apostle allowed me and I went to my parents and asked my mother, \"O my mother! What are the people talking about?\" My mother said, \"O my daughter! Take it easy, for by Allah, there is no charming lady who is loved by her husband who has other wives as well, but that those wives would find fault with her.\" I said, \"Subhan Allah! Did the people really talk about that?\" That night I kept on weeping the whole night till the morning. My tears never stopped, nor did I sleep, and morning broke while I was still weeping, Allahs Apostle called `Ali bin Abi Talib and Usama bin Zaid when the Divine Inspiration delayed, in order to consult them as to the idea of divorcing his wife. Usama bin Zaid told Allahs Apostle of what he knew about the innocence of his wife and of his affection he kept for her. He said, \"O Allahs Apostle! She is your wife, and we do not know anything about her except good.\" But `Ali bin Abi Talib said, \"O Allahs Apostle! Allah does not impose restrictions on you; and there are plenty of women other than her. If you however, ask (her) slave girl, she will tell you the truth.\" `Aisha added: So Allahs Apostle called for Barira and said, \"O Barira! Did you ever see anything which might have aroused your suspicion? (as regards Aisha). Barira said, \"By Allah Who has sent you with the truth, I have never seen anything regarding Aisha which I would blame her for except that she is a girl of immature age who sometimes sleeps and leaves the dough of her family unprotected so that the domestic goats come and eat it.\" So Allahs Apostle got up (and addressed) the people an asked for somebody who would take revenge on `Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul then. Allahs Apostle, while on the pulpit, said, \"O Muslims! Who will help me against a man who has hurt me by slandering my family? By Allah, I know nothing except good about my family, and people have blamed a man of whom I know nothing except good, and he never used to visit my family except with me,\" Sa`d bin Mu`adh Al-Ansari got up and said, \"O Allahs Apostle! By Allah, I will relieve you from him. If he be from the tribe of (Bani) Al-Aus, then I will chop his head off; and if he be from our brethren, the Khazraj, then you give us your order and we will obey it.\" On that, Sa`d bin Ubada got up, and he was the chief of the Khazraj, and before this incident he had been a pious man but he was incited by his zeal for his tribe. He said to Sa`d (bin Mu`adh), \"By Allah the Eternal, you have told a lie! You shall not kill him and you will never be able to kill him!\" On that, Usaid bin Hudair, the cousin of Sa`d (bin Mu`adh) got up and said to Sa`d bin Ubada, \"You are a liar! By Allah the Eternal, we will surely kill him; and you are a hypocrite defending the hypocrites!\" So the two tribes of Al-Aus and Al-Khazraj got excited till they were on the point of fighting with each other while Allahs Apostle was standing on the pulpit. Allahs Apostle continued quietening them till they became silent whereupon he became silent too. On that day I kept on weeping so much that neither did my tears stop, nor could I sleep. In the morning my parents were with me, and I had wept for two nights and a day without sleeping and with incessant tears till they thought that my liver would burst with weeping. While they were with me and I was weeping, an Ansari woman asked permission to see me. I admitted her and she sat and started weeping with me. While I was in that state, Allahs Apostle came to us, greeted, and sat down,. He had never sat with me since the day what was said, was said. He had stayed a month without receiving any Divine Inspiration concerning my case. Allahs Apostle recited the Tashahhud after he had sat down, and then said, \"Thereafter, O `Aisha! I have been informed such and-such a thing about you; and if you are innocent, Allah will reveal your innocence, and if you have committed a sin, then ask for Allahs forgiveness and repent to Him, for when a slave confesses his sin and then repents to Allah, Allah accepts his repentance.\" When Allahs Apostle had finished his speech, my tears ceased completely so that I no longer felt even a drop thereof. Then I said to my father, \"Reply to Allahs Apostle on my behalf as to what he said.\" He said, \"By Allah, I do not know what to say to Allahs Apostle.\" Then I said to my mother, \"Reply to Allahs Apostle.\" She said, \"I do not know what to say to Allahs Apostle.\" Still a young girl as I was and though I had little knowledge of Quran, I said, \"By Allah, I know that you heard this story (of the Ifk) so much so that it has been planted in your minds and you have believed it. So now, if I tell you that I am innocent, and Allah knows that I am innocent, you will not believe me; and if I confess something, and Allah knows that I am innocent of it, you will believe me. By Allah, I cannot find of you an example except that of Josephs father: \"So (for me) patience is most fitting against that which you assert and it is Allah (Alone) Whose help can be sought. Then I turned away and lay on my bed, and at that time I knew that I was innocent and that Allah would reveal my innocence. But by Allah, I never thought that Allah would sent down about my affair, Divine Inspiration that would be recited (forever), as I considered myself too unworthy to be talked of by Allah with something that was to be recited: but I hoped that Allahs Apostle might have a vision in which Allah would prove my innocence. By Allah, Allahs Apostle had not left his seat and nobody had left the house when the Divine Inspiration came to Allahs Apostle . So there overtook him the same hard condition which used to overtake him (when he was Divinely Inspired) so that the drops of his sweat were running down, like pearls, though it was a (cold) winter day, and that was because of the heaviness of the Statement which was revealed to him. When that state of Allahs Apostle was over, and he was smiling when he was relieved, the first word he said was, \"Aisha, Allah has declared your innocence.\" My mother said to me, \"Get up and go to him.\" I said, \"By Allah, I will not go to him and I will not thank anybody but Allah.\" So Allah revealed: \"Verily! They who spread the Slander are a gang among you. Think it not....\" (24.11-20). When Allah revealed this to confirm my innocence, Abu Bakr As-Siddiq who used to provide for Mistah bin Uthatha because of the latters kinship to him and his poverty, said, \"By Allah, I will never provide for Mistah anything after what he has said about Aisha\". So Allah revealed: (continued...) (continuing... 1): -6.274:... ... \"Let not those among you who are good and are wealthy swear not to give (help) to their kinsmen, those in need, and those who have left their homes for Allahs Cause. Let them Pardon and forgive (i.e. do not punish them). Do you not love that should forgive you? Verily Allah is Oft-forgiving. Most Merciful.\" (24.22) Abu Bakr said, \"Yes, by Allah, I wish that Allah should forgive me.\" So he resumed giving Mistah the aid he used to give him before and said, \"By Allah, I will never withold it from him at all.\" Aisha further said: Allahs Apostle also asked Zainab bint Jahsh about my case. He said, \"O Zainab! What have you seen?\" She replied, \"O Allahs Apostle! I protect my hearing and my sight (by refraining from telling lies). I know nothing but good (about Aisha).\" Of all the wives of Allahs Apostle, it was Zainab who aspired to receive from him the same favor as I used to receive, yet, Allah saved her (from telling lies) because of her piety. But her sister, Hamna, kept on fighting on her behalf so she was destroyed as were those who invented and spread the slander.<D>Narrated Aisha:(the wife of the Prophet) \"Whenever Allahs Apostle intended to go on a journey, he would draw lots amongst his wives and would take with him the one upon whom the lot fell. During a Ghazwa of his, he drew lots amongst us and the lot fell upon me, and I proceeded with him after Allah had decreed the use of the veil by women. I was carried in a Howdah (on the camel) and dismounted while still in it. When Allahs Apostle was through with his Ghazwa and returned home, and we approached the city of Medina, Allahs Apostle ordered us to proceed at night. When the order of setting off was given, I walked till I was past the army to answer the call of nature. After finishing I returned (to the camp) to depart (with the others) and suddenly realized that my necklace over my chest was missing. So, I returned to look for it and was delayed because of that. The people who used to carry me on the camel, came to my Howdah and put it on the back of the camel, thinking that I was in it, as, at that time, women were light in weight, and thin and lean, and did not use to eat much. So, those people did not feel the difference in the heaviness of the Howdah while lifting it, and they put it over the camel. At that time I was a young lady. They set the camel moving and proceeded on. I found my necklace after the army had gone, and came to their camp to find nobody. So, I went to the place where I used to stay, thinking that they would discover my absence and come back in my search. While in that state, I felt sleepy and slept. Safwan bin Muattal As-Sulami Adh-Dhakwani was behind the army and reached my abode in the morning. When he saw a sleeping person, he came to me, and he used to see me before veiling. So, I got up when I heard him saying, \"Inna lil-lah-wa inn a ilaihi rajiun (We are for Allah, and we will return to Him).\" He made his camel knell down. He got down from his camel, and put his leg on the front legs of the camel and then I rode and sat over it. Safwan set out walking, leading the camel by the rope till we reached the army who had halted to take rest at midday. Then whoever was meant for destruction, fell into destruction, (some people accused me falsely) and the leader of the false accusers was `Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul. After that we returned to Medina, and I became ill for one month while the people were spreading the forged statements of the false accusers. I was feeling during my ailment as if I were not receiving the usual kindness from the Prophet which I used to receive from him when I got sick. But he would come, greet and say, How is that (girl)? I did not know anything of what was going on till I recovered from my ailment and went out with Um Mistah to the Manasi where we used to answer the call of nature, and we used not to go to answer the call of nature except from night to night and that was before we had lavatories near to our houses. And this habit of ours was similar to the habit of the old Arabs in the open country (or away from houses). So. I and Um Mistah bint Ruhm went out walking. Um Mistah stumbled because of her long dress and on that she said, Let Mistah be ruined. I said, You are saying a bad word. Why are you abusing a man who took part in (the battle of) Badr? She said, O Hanata (you there) didnt you hear what they said? Then she told me the rumors of the false accusers. My sickness was aggravated, and when I returned home, Allahs Apostle came to me, and after greeting he said, How is that (girl)? I requested him to allow me to go to my parents. I wanted then to be sure of the news through them I Allahs Apostle allowed me, and I went to my parents and asked my mother, What are the people talking about? She said, O my daughter! Dont worry much about this matter. By Allah, never is there a charming woman loved by her husband who has other wives, but the women would forge false news about her. I said, Glorified be Allah! Are the people really taking of this matter? That night I kept on weeping and could not sleep till morning. In the morning Allahs Apostle called `Ali bin Abu Talib and Usama bin Zaid when he saw the Divine Inspiration delayed, to consul them about divorcing his wife (i.e. `Aisha). Usama bin Zaid said what he knew of the good reputation of his wives and added, O Allahs Apostle! Keep you wife, for, by Allah, we know nothing about her but good. `Ali bin Abu Talib said, O Allahs Apostle! Allah has no imposed restrictions on you, and there are many women other than she, yet you may ask the woman-servant who will tell you the truth. On that Allahs Apostle called Buraira and said, O Burair. Did you ever see anything which roused your suspicions about her? Buraira said, No, by Allah Who has sent you with the Truth, I have never seen in her anything faulty except that she is a girl of immature age, who sometimes sleeps and leaves the dough for the goats to eat. On that day Allahs Apostle ascended the pulpit and requested that somebody support him in punishing `Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul. Allahs Apostle said, Who will support me to punish that person (`Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul) who has hurt me by slandering the reputation of my family? By Allah, I know nothing about my family but good, and they have accused a person about whom I know nothing except good, and he never entered my house except in my company. Sa`d bin Mu`adh got up and said, O Allahs Apostle! by Allah, I will relieve you from him. If that man is from the tribe of the Aus, then we will chop his head off, and if he is from our brothers, the Khazraj, then order us, and we will fulfill your order. On that Sa`d bin Ubada, the chief of the Khazraj and before this incident, he had been a pious man, got up, motivated by his zeal for his tribe and said, By Allah, you have told a lie; you cannot kill him, and you will never be able to kill him. On that Usaid bin Al-Hadir got up and said (to Sa`d bin Ubada), By Allah! you are a liar. By Allah, we will kill him; and you are a hypocrite, defending the hypocrites. On this the two tribes of Aus and Khazraj got excited and were about to fight each other, while Allahs Apostle was standing on the pulpit. He got down and quieted them till they became silent and he kept quiet. On that day I kept on weeping so much so that neither did my tears stop, nor could I sleep. In the morning my parents were with me and I had wept for two nights and a day, till I thought my liver would burst from weeping. While they were sitting with me and I was weeping, an Ansari woman asked my permission to enter, and I allowed her to come in. She sat down and started weeping with me. While we were in this state, Allahs Apostle came and sat down and he had never sat with me since the day they forged the accusation. No revelation regarding my case came to him for a month. He recited Tashah-hud (i.e. None has the right to be worshipped but Allah and Muhammad is His Apostle) and then said, O `Aisha! I have been informed such-and-such about you; if you are innocent, then Allah will soon reveal your innocence, and if you have committed a sin, then repent to Allah and ask Him to forgive you, for when a person confesses his sin and asks Allah for forgiveness, Allah accepts his repentance. When Allahs Apostle finished his speech my tears ceased completely and there remained not even a single drop of it. I requested my father to reply to Allahs Apostle on my behalf. My father said, By Allah, I do not know what to say to Allahs Apostle. I said to my mother, Talk to Allahs Apostle on my behalf. She said, By Allah, I do not know what to say to Allahs Apostle. I was a young girl and did not have much knowledge of the Quran. I said. I know, by Allah, that you have listened to what people are saying and that has been planted in your minds and you have taken it as a truth. Now, if I told you that I am innocent and Allah knows that I am innocent, you would not believe me and if I confessed to you falsely that I am guilty, and Allah knows that I am innocent you would believe me. By Allah, I dont compare my situation with you except to the situation of Josephs father (i.e. Jacob) who said, So (for me) patience is most fitting against that which you assert and it is Allah (Alone) whose help can be sought. Then I turned to the other side of my bed hoping that Allah would prove my innocence. By Allah I never thought that Allah would reveal Divine Inspiration in my case, as I considered myself too inferior to be talked of in the Holy Quran. I had hoped that Allahs Apostle might have a dream in which Allah would prove my innocence. By Allah, Allahs Apostle had not got up and nobody had left the house before the Divine Inspiration came to Allahs Apostle. So, there overtook him the same state which used to overtake him, (when he used to have, on being inspired divinely). He was sweating so much so that the drops of the sweat were dropping like pearls though it was a (cold) wintry day. When that state of Allahs Apostle was over, he was smiling and the first word he said, `Aisha! Thank Allah, for Allah has declared your innocence. My mother told me to go to Allahs Apostle . I replied, By Allah I will not go to him and will not thank but Allah. So Allah revealed: \"Verily! They who spread the slander are a gang among you . . .\" (24.11) When Allah gave the declaration of my Innocence, Abu Bakr, who used to provide for Mistah bin Uthatha for he was his relative, said, By Allah, I will never provide Mistah with anything because of what he said about Aisha. But Allah later revealed: -- \"And let not those who are good and wealthy among you swear not to help their kinsmen, those in need and those who left their homes in Allahs Cause. Let them forgive and overlook. Do you not wish that Allah should forgive you? Verily! Allah is Oft-forgiving, Most Merciful.\" (24.22) After that Abu Bakr said, Yes ! By Allah! I like that Allah should forgive me, and resumed helping Mistah whom he used to help before. Allahs Apostle also asked Zainab bint Jahsh (i.e. the Prophets wife about me saying, What do you know and what did you see? She replied, O Allahs Apostle! I refrain to claim hearing or seeing what I have not heard or seen. By Allah, I know nothing except goodness about Aisha.\" Aisha further added \"Zainab was competing with me (in her beauty and the Prophets love), yet Allah protected her (from being malicious), for she had piety.\"<D>Narrated Aishah:\"What was said about me had been said, and I myself was unaware of it, the Messenger of Allah () got up and addressed the people. He recited the Tashahhud and after praising and expressing gratitude to Allah, as He deserved, he said: To proceed: O people! Give me your opinion regarding those people who made a forged story against my wife. By Allah, I do not know anything bad about her at all. By Allah, they accused her of being with a man about whom I have never known anything bad, and he never entered my house unless I was present there, and whenever I went on a journey, he went with me. Sad bin Muadh [may Allah be pleased with him] got up and said: O Messenger of Allah ()! Allow me to chop their heads off! Then a man from Al-Khazraj, to whom the mother of Hassan bin Thabit was a relative, got up and said (to Sad): You have told a lie! By Allah, if those persons were from Al-Aws, you would not like to chop their heads. It was probable that some evil would take place between Aws and Khazraj in the Masjid while I was unaware of that. In the evening of that day, I went out for some of my needs, and Umm Mistah was accompanying me. On our return, Umm Mistah stumbled and said: Let Mistah be ruined! I said to her, O mother! Why do you abuse your son? On that Umm Mistah became silent for a while, and stumbling again, she said: Let Mistah be ruined! I said to her: O mother! Why do you abuse your son? She stumbled for the third time and said: Let Mistah be ruined! I said to her: O mother! Why do you abuse your son? Upon that she said: By Allah! I do not abuse him except because of you. I asked her: Concerning what of my affairs? So she disclosed the whole story to me. I said: Has this really happened? She replied: Yes, by Allah! I returned to my house, so astonished, that I did not know for what purpose I had gone out. Then I became sick and said to the Messenger of Allah () Send me to my fathers house. So he sent a servant with me, and when I entered the house, I found Umm Ruman downstairs, while Abu Bakr was reciting something upstairs. My mother asked: What has brought you, O daughter? She said: \"I informed her and mentioned the whole story to her, but she did not feel as I did about it. She said: O my daughter! Do not worry much about this matter, for there is never a charming lady loved by her husband who has other wives, but that they feel jealous of her and speak badly of her. But she did not feel the same about it as I did. I asked her: Does my father know about it? She said Yes. I asked: Does the Messenger of Allah () know about it too? She said Yes, the Messenger of Allah () also knows about it. Tears filled my eyes and I wept. Abu Bakr, who was reading upstairs, heard my voice, and came down asking my mother: What is the matter with her? She said: She has heard what has been said about her. On that Abu Bakr wept and said: I beseech you, by Allah, O my daughter, to go back to your home. I went back to my home, and the Messenger of Allah () had come to my house asking my maid-servant about me. The maid-servant said: By Allah! I do not know of any fault or defect in her character except that she sleeps and lets the sheep enter and eat her dough. On that, some of the Prophets Companions spoke harshly to her and said: Tell the truth to the Messenger of Allah (). Finally, they told her of the slander and she said: Subhan Allah! By Allah, I know nothing against her except what a goldsmith knows about a piece of pure gold. Then this news reached the man who was accused, and he said: Subhan Allah! By Allah, I have never uncovered the private parts of any woman. Later, that man was martyred in Allahs Cause. Then the next morning, my parents came to pay me a visit and they stayed with me until the Messenger of Allah () came to me, after he performed the Asr prayer. He came to me and while my parents were sitting around me on my right and my left. The Prophet () said the Tashahhud, praised and glorified Allah and said: Now then, O Aishah! If you have committed a bad deed, or you have wronged (yourself), then repent to Allah, as Allah accepts the repentance from His worshipers. An Ansari woman had come and was sitting near the gate. I said to the Prophet (): Isnt it improper that you speak in such a way in the presence of this lady? The Messenger of Allah () then gave a piece of advice and I turned to my father and requested him to reply to him. My father said: What should I say? Then I turned to my mother and asked her to answer him. She said: What should I say? When my parents did not reply to the Prophet (), I said the Tashahhud, praised and glorified Allah as His due, and I said: Then, by Allah! If I were to tell you that I have not done (this) and Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, is witness that I am telling the truth, that would not be of any use to me on your part, because you (people) have spoken about it and your hearts have absorbed it (as truth); and if I were to tell you that I have done this sin, and Allah knows that I have not done it, then you will say: She has confessed her guilt. By Allah! I do not see a suitable example for me and you except the example of - and I could not remember Yaqbus name - Yusufs father when he said: So patience is most fitting. And it is Allah Whose help can be sought against that which you describe (12:18). She said: \"It was at that time that Revelation came to the Messenger of Allah (), and we remained silent. Then the Revelation was over, and I noticed the signs of happiness on his face while he was wiping (the sweat) from his forehead, and saying: Have the good tidings O Aishah! Allah has revealed your innocence. At that time I was extremely angry. My parents said to me: Get up and go to him. I said: By Allah, I will not do it,and will not thank him nor either of you, but I will thank Allah, Who has revealed my innocence. You have heard (this story) but neither of you have denied it, nor have you changed it (to defend me).\" Aishah used to say: \"But as regards to Zainab bint Jahsh, Allah protected her because of her piety. She did not say anything except good (about me). But her sister, Hamnah was ruined among those who were ruined. Those who used to speak evil about me were Mistah, Hassan bin Thabit, and the hypocrite Abdullah bin Ubayy [bin Salul] and [it is he who] used to spread that news and tempt others to speak of it, and it was he and Hamnah who had the greater share therein. Abu Bakr took an oath that he would never do any favor for Mistah at all.

I'll do my best to provide a neutral and empathetic response.\n\nIt sounds like your friend initially felt a sense of liberation and confidence when she started wearing the scarf, and you felt empowered by her strength. However, now she's experiencing some internal conflict and questioning the reasons behind wearing it. She's even considering taking it off or making exceptions, like when she went clubbing with her sister.\n\nFirstly, it's essential to acknowledge that your friend's feelings and struggles are valid. It's normal for people to have conflicting emotions, especially when it comes to practices or traditions that may feel restrictive or challenging.\n\nAs a supportive friend, you can reassure her that you're there to listen and help her explore her thoughts and feelings. Here are some suggestions:\n\n1. **Listen without judgment**: Allow your friend to share her concerns and feelings without interrupting or judging her. Create a safe space for her to express herself.\n2. **Avoid taking it personally**: Try not to link your own feelings of empowerment to your friend's decision to wear the scarf. Her choices are hers alone, and it's not about your feelings or reactions.\n3. **Explore her reasons**: Gently ask your friend to share her thoughts and feelings about wearing the scarf. What were her initial reasons for wearing it? What's making her question it now?\n4. **Focus on her autonomy**: Reassure your friend that it's her decision to make, and you respect her choice, whether she decides to continue wearing the scarf or not.\n5. **Be supportive**: Let your friend know that you're there to support her, regardless of her decision. You can say something like, \"I'm here for you, and I want to support you in whatever you decide. Can we talk more about what's been going on and how you're feeling?\"\n\nBy being a supportive and non-judgmental listener, you can help your friend navigate her feelings and make her own decisions about wearing the scarf.\n\nIf you're still unsure or need further guidance, feel free to ask."}

He says: and of that which you cast inthe fire of gold and silver contains adulteration just as the foam of the sea does have salt (in order to make ornaments) which you were. Allah says here: the Truth is like gold and silver which benefit people, and falsehood is like the impurities which are derived from the casting of gold and silver, which are of no benefit. Likewise falsehood benefits no one (and tools) ore and copper (riseth a foam like unto it) He says: these also have impurities, i.e. just as the foam of the sea. This is another simile. He says: the Truth is like ore and copper from which people benefit, just as people benefit from the Truth. And falsehood is like the impurities resulting from the casting of ore and copper, which are of no benefit, just as falsehood is of no benefit to anyone, (thus Allah coineth (the similitude of)) thus Allah explains (the true and the false.

The act of lending something haraam is not considered appropriate in Islam because it involves assisting in or enabling something considered sinful or forbidden. However, the primary concern here is the video game itself being haraam, likely due to its content (e.g., containing inappropriate or immoral material).\n\nIslam teaches to avoid and discourage haraam activities or items. If the video game is considered haraam due to its content, the Islamic principle is to avoid engaging with it or promoting it.\n\nNow, addressing your question directly:\n\n1. **Retrieving the Video Game**: The effort to retrieve the video game to destroy it might be seen as going to great lengths to ensure something haraam is disposed of. However, considering the person has moved to another city, making a significant effort to retrieve it might not be obligatory.\n\n2. **Islamic Ruling**: In Islamic jurisprudence, the general rule is that one is not held responsible for something that is beyond their capability or which involves hardship. The Quran states, \"Allah does not burden a soul beyond what it can bear\" (2:286).\n\n3. **Alternative Solutions**: If retrieving the video game is difficult, you could consider it out of your responsibility, especially if you've not been asked to lend it for a sinful purpose directly. Your intention was to lend it, not to promote haraam. \n\n4. **Making Dua (Supplication)**: You could make a supplication (dua) to Allah that the person destroys or stops using the video game, or that it is removed from their possession in a lawful way.\n\n5. **Principle of Avoiding Harm**: Islam emphasizes removing or avoiding harm. If the video game is in the possession of someone else and you're unable to retrieve it without significant hardship, the emphasis shifts from retrieving the item to ensuring you're not promoting or facilitating haraam activities going forward.\n\nIn summary, while the ideal might be to destroy the haraam item, if it's beyond your capability to retrieve it without significant hardship, you can be considered to have fulfilled your obligation by having the intention to avoid promoting haraam. Making dua for the item to be disposed of or for the person to stop using it could be a supplementary step."}

Let's address your situation with some practical advice.\n\nFirstly, it's essential to understand that incomplete evacuation and staining on tissue can be related to several factors, including diet, bowel habits, and possibly some underlying conditions. Here are some steps you can take to alleviate your symptoms:\n\n1. **Dietary Changes**: Increase your fiber intake through fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. Fiber helps soften and bulk up stool, making it easier to pass. Foods rich in fiber include leafy greens, broccoli, apples, bananas, and whole wheat bread.\n\n2. **Hydration**: Drink plenty of water throughout the day. Adequate hydration is crucial for preventing constipation as it helps soften stool and promote regular bowel movements.\n\n3. **Physical Activity**: Regular physical activity can help stimulate bowel movements. Even a short walk after meals can be beneficial.\n\n4. **Bowel Habits**: Try to establish a regular bowel routine. Spend a reasonable amount of time on the toilet, but avoid straining. Straining can lead to or exacerbate hemorrhoids, which could also cause staining.\n\n5. **Proper Wiping and Hygiene**: Continue washing with water after bowel movements. If you're concerned about staining, using wet wipes can be more effective than dry tissue. However, be gentle to avoid irritation.\n\n6. **Toilet Position**: Consider trying the \"lean forward\" or \"squatting\" position on the toilet to help straighten out the rectum, which can make it easier to pass stool.\n\n7. **Medical Consultation**: If your symptoms persist despite making these changes, it's a good idea to consult a healthcare professional. They can assess whether there's an underlying condition that needs to be addressed, such as hemorrhoids, anal fissures, or other issues. They might also recommend laxatives or other treatments if necessary.\n\n8. **Avoid Delaying Bowel Movements**: Go to the bathroom when you feel the urge. Delaying can lead to constipation.\n\nRegarding your practice of not washing after bowel movements and walking around, it's not recommended to avoid washing as it can lead to irritation and infection. Keeping the area clean is important for hygiene and comfort.\n\nLastly, if you notice any of the following, seek medical attention: significant changes in bowel habits, severe abdominal pain, rectal bleeding (especially if it's not just a stain but more significant), or if you're experiencing discomfort that's impacting your daily life.\n\nTaking these steps should help alleviate your symptoms.

{"Question": "I have been asked by someone who is considering to convert to Islam whether or not it is permissible for men to to wear earrings according to the classical fiqh? I told him that I was unaware of a complete consensus on this issue, although it was agreed that for men to imitate women and to wear gold was forbidden. (he was wearing wooden cuffs on the ears). I expressed uncertainty on this as I recalled ( I think, long time ago) seeing Arabian and African Muslim tribesmen wearing earrings, although I do not think they were wearing golden ones. ? --T--", "Answer": " It is impermissible for men to wear earrings or have their ears pierced in order to wear earrings. There are certain reasons for this prohibition: Firstly, it is agreed upon by the scholars, that it is unlawful for men to adorn themselves with any type of jewellery besides a silver ring. (See: Ibn Qudama, al-Mughni, 2.324 & al-Mawsua al-Fiqhiyya). The great Hanafi Jurist, Imam al-Haskafi (may Allah have mercy on him) states in his famous work, Durr al-Mukhtar: It is not permissible for a man to adorn himself with any type of gold and silver whatsoever (mutlaqan) besides a silver ring(Radd al-Muhtar ala al-Durr al-Mukhtar, 6/358-359, fasl fi al-libas). Secondly, earrings are (still) generally considered a type of adornment for women and even in the West they were originally worn by those men who wanted to imitate women. Imitating women intentionally is considered unlawful in Islam. Sayyiduna Abd Allah ibn Abbas (Allah be pleased with him) relates, that the Messenger of Allah (Allah bless him & give him peace): Cursed those men who imitate women and those women who imitate men (Sahih al-Bukhari, 7/205). Thirdly, wearing earrings is a custom that developed and is generally prevalent among non-Muslim men, and imitating non-Muslims is also impermissible. Sayyiduna Abd Allah ibn Umar (Allah be pleased with him) narrates that the Messenger of Allah (Allah bless him & give him peace) said: Whoever imitates a people is one of them. (Sunan Abu Dawud, no. 4031 & Musnad Ahmad, 2/50) Given the above reasons, it would not be permissible for men to wear and adorn themselves with earrings", "Document": "Narrated Umm Salamah, Ummul Muminin:When the verse \"That they should cast their outer garments over their persons\" was revealed, the women of Ansar came out as if they had crows over their heads by wearing outer garments.<D>Narrated Umm Salamah, Ummul Muminin:When the verse \"That they should cast their outer garments over their persons\" was revealed, the women of Ansar came out as if they had crows over their heads by wearing outer garments.<D>Narrated Imran ibn Husayn:The Prophet () said: I do not ride on purple, or wear a garment dyed with saffron, or wear shirt hemmed with silk.

Said said: I think he said: They interpreted his tradition about perfume used by women as applying when she comes out. But when she is with her husband, she may use any perfume she wishes.<D>((Pharaoh) said unto those around him) of attendants: (Hear ye not) what Moses says? There were around Pharaoh at that time 250 men wearing attires made of silk brocade plaited with gold. These men were Pharaohs closest courtiers, and they asked Moses: who is this Lord of the heavens and the earth to whom you are calling us? <D>Allah then showed their abode, saying: (Gardens of Eden!) the chamber of the Beneficent is their dwelling, with the Gardens surrounding it.

The issue is debated among various schools of thought and jurists. Here's a summary of the different perspectives:\n\n1. **Imitation of women**: Many jurists agree that men are not allowed to imitate women in their attire and adornments, based on hadiths (Prophetic traditions) that prohibit such imitation. Wearing earrings, in this context, might be considered a feminine practice. (e.g., Al-Nawawi, a Shafi'i jurist, mentions this in his Majmu').\n2. **Gold adornments**: There's a general consensus that men are not allowed to wear gold jewelry, including earrings, as it's considered a luxury and an imitation of the practices of the pre-Islamic Arabs and non-Muslims. This is based on hadiths that prohibit men from wearing gold.\n3. **Other materials**: The debate centers on whether men can wear earrings made from materials other than gold, such as silver, wood, or other substances. Some jurists permit men to wear earrings made from these materials, while others consider it makruh (disapproved) or haram (forbidden).\n\nSome examples of classical jurists' opinions:\n\n* The Hanafi jurist, Ibn 'Abidin, states that men are allowed to wear earrings made from silver, but not gold.\n* The Maliki jurist, Al-Dasuqi, considers it makruh for men to wear earrings, regardless of the material.\n* The Shafi'i jurist, Al-Ghazali, mentions that some scholars permit men to wear earrings, while others prohibit it.\n\nYour observation about Arabian and African Muslim tribesmen wearing earrings is also valid. Cultural practices and local customs have influenced the way Islamic law is applied in different regions. While some Muslim men in certain cultures wear earrings, it's not necessarily a universal practice among Muslims.\n\nIn summary, while there's no clear consensus on the permissibility of men wearing earrings, the majority of jurists agree that wearing gold earrings is haram, and imitating women's attire and adornments is also prohibited. For other materials, the opinions vary.\n\nYou could respond to the person considering converting to Islam by explaining the different perspectives and the nuances involved. You might say something like:\n\n\"While there's no single, universally accepted answer,"}

However, the key factor is whether the impurity (urine) actually transfers to the clean clothes.\n\n3. **Islamic Jurisprudence**: Different Islamic schools of thought have varying opinions on how to handle such situations. Generally, if the impurity is wet and transfers to the other clothes, those clothes may become impure.\n\nTo resolve the issue:\n\n- **Precaution**: If you're aware that the clothes came into contact, it's best to err on the side of caution and wash them again, especially if you're unsure whether the impurity transferred.\n\n- **Visible Impurity**: Check the clean clothes for any visible signs of impurity (e.g., color change, smell). If they appear and smell clean, some might consider them still clean, especially if the amount of urine on the napaak clothes was minimal.\n\n- **Scholarly Advice**: For a more precise ruling, consult with a local Islamic scholar or a trusted authority who can provide guidance based on your specific circumstances and the jurisprudential school you're following.\n\nIn general, while it might seem inconvenient, washing the clothes again is the safest option to ensure purity, especially if you're uncertain about the transfer of impurity."}
{"Question": "Q: If I have doubts about urine splashes (say I feel something on my legs whilst urinating) do I have to check (feel it with my hand) to see if it has splashed and if it is wet or do I just ignore it and not check. Worst case scenario it splashes a little but if I start touching the part where I think it splashed I may spread it but if I dont it will be less than 50p and my namaz will still count right? Anyway I take all the precautions. I put tissue down in the toilet and pee on the tissue so it is less likely to splash, however there is always a possibility that it will splash and even the slightest hair movement on my leg I will think its a splash and the fear of that worries me a lot and makes me think and have a lot of doubts. Please can you help me and give me some advice? ? --T--", "Answer": "If you are sure that it had splashed then wash that area. And Allah Taala ( ) knows best", "Document": "Narrated Aisha:(The wife of the Prophet) Whenever Allahs Apostle intended to go on a journey, he used to draw lots among his wives and would take with him the one on whom the lot had fallen. Once he drew lots when he wanted to carry out a Ghazwa, and the lot came upon me. So I proceeded with Allahs Apostle after Allahs order of veiling (the women) had been revealed and thus I was carried in my howdah (on a camel) and dismounted while still in it. We carried on our journey, and when Allahs Apostle had finished his Ghazwa and returned and we approached Medina, Allahs Apostle ordered to proceed at night. When the army was ordered to resume the homeward journey, I got up and walked on till I left the army (camp) behind. When I had answered the call of nature, I went towards my howdah, but behold ! A necklace of mine made of Jaz Azfar (a kind of black bead) was broken and I looked for it and my search for it detained me. The group of people who used to carry me, came and carried my howdah on to the back of my camel on which I was riding, considering that I was therein. At that time women were light in weight and were not fleshy for they used to eat little (food), so those people did not feel the lightness of the howdah while raising it up, and I was still a young lady. They drove away the camel and proceeded. Then I found my necklace after the army had gone. I came to their camp but found nobody therein so I went to the place where I used to stay, thinking that they would miss me and come back in my search. While I was sitting at my place, I felt sleepy and slept. Safwan bin Al-Muattil As-Sulami Adh- Dhakw-ani was behind the army. He had started in the last part of the night and reached my stationing place in the morning and saw the figure of a sleeping person. He came to me and recognized me on seeing me for he used to see me before veiling. I got up because of his saying: \"Inna Li l-lahi wa inna ilaihi rajiun,\" which he uttered on recognizing me. I covered my face with my garment, and by Allah, he did not say to me a single word except, \"Inna Li l-lahi wa inna ilaihi rajiun,\" till he made his shecamel kneel down whereupon he trod on its forelegs and I mounted it. Then Safwan set out, leading the she-camel that was carrying me, till we met the army while they were resting during the hot midday. Then whoever was meant for destruction, fell in destruction, and the leader of the Ifk (forged statement) was `Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul. After this we arrived at Medina and I became ill for one month while the people were spreading the forged statements of the people of the Ifk, and I was not aware of anything thereof. But what aroused my doubt while I was sick, was that I was no longer receiving from Allahs Apostle the same kindness as I used to receive when I fell sick. Allahs Apostle would enter upon me, say a greeting and add, \"How is that (lady)?\" and then depart. That aroused my suspicion but I was not aware of the propagated evil till I recovered from my ailment. I went out with Um Mistah to answer the call of nature towards Al-Manasi, the place where we used to relieve ourselves, and used not to go out for this purpose except from night to night, and that was before we had lavatories close to our houses. And this habit of ours was similar to the habit of the old Arabs (in the deserts or in the tents) concerning the evacuation of the bowels, for we considered it troublesome and harmful to take lavatories in the houses. So I went out with Um Mistah who was the daughter of Abi Ruhm bin `Abd Manaf, and her mother was daughter of Sakhr bin Amir who was the aunt of Abi Bakr As-Siddiq, and her son was Mistah bin Uthatha. When we had finished our affair, Um Mistah and I came back towards my house. Um Mistah stumbled over her robe whereupon she said, \"Let Mistah be ruined ! \" I said to her, \"What a bad word you have said! Do you abuse a man who has taken part in the Battle of Badr? She said, \"O you there! Didnt you hear what he has said?\" I said, \"And what did he say?\" She then told me the statement of the people of the Ifk (forged statement) which added to my ailment. When I returned home, Allahs Apostle came to me, and after greeting, he said, \"How is that (lady)?\" I said, \"Will you allow me to go to my parents?\" At that time I intended to be sure of the news through them. Allahs Apostle allowed me and I went to my parents and asked my mother, \"O my mother! What are the people talking about?\" My mother said, \"O my daughter! Take it easy, for by Allah, there is no charming lady who is loved by her husband who has other wives as well, but that those wives would find fault with her.\" I said, \"Subhan Allah! Did the people really talk about that?\" That night I kept on weeping the whole night till the morning. My tears never stopped, nor did I sleep, and morning broke while I was still weeping, Allahs Apostle called `Ali bin Abi Talib and Usama bin Zaid when the Divine Inspiration delayed, in order to consult them as to the idea of divorcing his wife. Usama bin Zaid told Allahs Apostle of what he knew about the innocence of his wife and of his affection he kept for her. He said, \"O Allahs Apostle! She is your wife, and we do not know anything about her except good.\" But `Ali bin Abi Talib said, \"O Allahs Apostle! Allah does not impose restrictions on you; and there are plenty of women other than her. If you however, ask (her) slave girl, she will tell you the truth.\" `Aisha added: So Allahs Apostle called for Barira and said, \"O Barira! Did you ever see anything which might have aroused your suspicion? (as regards Aisha). Barira said, \"By Allah Who has sent you with the truth, I have never seen anything regarding Aisha which I would blame her for except that she is a girl of immature age who sometimes sleeps and leaves the dough of her family unprotected so that the domestic goats come and eat it.\" So Allahs Apostle got up (and addressed) the people an asked for somebody who would take revenge on `Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul then. Allahs Apostle, while on the pulpit, said, \"O Muslims! Who will help me against a man who has hurt me by slandering my family? By Allah, I know nothing except good about my family, and people have blamed a man of whom I know nothing except good, and he never used to visit my family except with me,\" Sa`d bin Mu`adh Al-Ansari got up and said, \"O Allahs Apostle! By Allah, I will relieve you from him. If he be from the tribe of (Bani) Al-Aus, then I will chop his head off; and if he be from our brethren, the Khazraj, then you give us your order and we will obey it.\" On that, Sa`d bin Ubada got up, and he was the chief of the Khazraj, and before this incident he had been a pious man but he was incited by his zeal for his tribe. He said to Sa`d (bin Mu`adh), \"By Allah the Eternal, you have told a lie! You shall not kill him and you will never be able to kill him!\" On that, Usaid bin Hudair, the cousin of Sa`d (bin Mu`adh) got up and said to Sa`d bin Ubada, \"You are a liar! By Allah the Eternal, we will surely kill him; and you are a hypocrite defending the hypocrites!\" So the two tribes of Al-Aus and Al-Khazraj got excited till they were on the point of fighting with each other while Allahs Apostle was standing on the pulpit. Allahs Apostle continued quietening them till they became silent whereupon he became silent too. On that day I kept on weeping so much that neither did my tears stop, nor could I sleep. In the morning my parents were with me, and I had wept for two nights and a day without sleeping and with incessant tears till they thought that my liver would burst with weeping. While they were with me and I was weeping, an Ansari woman asked permission to see me. I admitted her and she sat and started weeping with me. While I was in that state, Allahs Apostle came to us, greeted, and sat down,. He had never sat with me since the day what was said, was said. He had stayed a month without receiving any Divine Inspiration concerning my case. Allahs Apostle recited the Tashahhud after he had sat down, and then said, \"Thereafter, O `Aisha! I have been informed such and-such a thing about you; and if you are innocent, Allah will reveal your innocence, and if you have committed a sin, then ask for Allahs forgiveness and repent to Him, for when a slave confesses his sin and then repents to Allah, Allah accepts his repentance.\" When Allahs Apostle had finished his speech, my tears ceased completely so that I no longer felt even a drop thereof. Then I said to my father, \"Reply to Allahs Apostle on my behalf as to what he said.\" He said, \"By Allah, I do not know what to say to Allahs Apostle.\" Then I said to my mother, \"Reply to Allahs Apostle.\" She said, \"I do not know what to say to Allahs Apostle.\" Still a young girl as I was and though I had little knowledge of Quran, I said, \"By Allah, I know that you heard this story (of the Ifk) so much so that it has been planted in your minds and you have believed it. So now, if I tell you that I am innocent, and Allah knows that I am innocent, you will not believe me; and if I confess something, and Allah knows that I am innocent of it, you will believe me. By Allah, I cannot find of you an example except that of Josephs father: \"So (for me) patience is most fitting against that which you assert and it is Allah (Alone) Whose help can be sought. Then I turned away and lay on my bed, and at that time I knew that I was innocent and that Allah would reveal my innocence. But by Allah, I never thought that Allah would sent down about my affair, Divine Inspiration that would be recited (forever), as I considered myself too unworthy to be talked of by Allah with something that was to be recited: but I hoped that Allahs Apostle might have a vision in which Allah would prove my innocence. By Allah, Allahs Apostle had not left his seat and nobody had left the house when the Divine Inspiration came to Allahs Apostle . So there overtook him the same hard condition which used to overtake him (when he was Divinely Inspired) so that the drops of his sweat were running down, like pearls, though it was a (cold) winter day, and that was because of the heaviness of the Statement which was revealed to him. When that state of Allahs Apostle was over, and he was smiling when he was relieved, the first word he said was, \"Aisha, Allah has declared your innocence.\" My mother said to me, \"Get up and go to him.\" I said, \"By Allah, I will not go to him and I will not thank anybody but Allah.\" So Allah revealed: \"Verily! They who spread the Slander are a gang among you. Think it not....\" (24.11-20). When Allah revealed this to confirm my innocence, Abu Bakr As-Siddiq who used to provide for Mistah bin Uthatha because of the latters kinship to him and his poverty, said, \"By Allah, I will never provide for Mistah anything after what he has said about Aisha\". So Allah revealed: (continued...) (continuing... 1): -6.274:... ... \"Let not those among you who are good and are wealthy swear not to give (help) to their kinsmen, those in need, and those who have left their homes for Allahs Cause. Let them Pardon and forgive (i.e. do not punish them). Do you not love that should forgive you? Verily Allah is Oft-forgiving. Most Merciful.\" (24.22) Abu Bakr said, \"Yes, by Allah, I wish that Allah should forgive me.\" So he resumed giving Mistah the aid he used to give him before and said, \"By Allah, I will never withold it from him at all.\" Aisha further said: Allahs Apostle also asked Zainab bint Jahsh about my case. He said, \"O Zainab! What have you seen?\" She replied, \"O Allahs Apostle! I protect my hearing and my sight (by refraining from telling lies). I know nothing but good (about Aisha).\" Of all the wives of Allahs Apostle, it was Zainab who aspired to receive from him the same favor as I used to receive, yet, Allah saved her (from telling lies) because of her piety. But her sister, Hamna, kept on fighting on her behalf so she was destroyed as were those who invented and spread the slander.<D>Narrated Aisha:(the wife of the Prophet) \"Whenever Allahs Apostle intended to go on a journey, he would draw lots amongst his wives and would take with him the one upon whom the lot fell. During a Ghazwa of his, he drew lots amongst us and the lot fell upon me, and I proceeded with him after Allah had decreed the use of the veil by women. I was carried in a Howdah (on the camel) and dismounted while still in it. When Allahs Apostle was through with his Ghazwa and returned home, and we approached the city of Medina, Allahs Apostle ordered us to proceed at night. When the order of setting off was given, I walked till I was past the army to answer the call of nature. After finishing I returned (to the camp) to depart (with the others) and suddenly realized that my necklace over my chest was missing. So, I returned to look for it and was delayed because of that. The people who used to carry me on the camel, came to my Howdah and put it on the back of the camel, thinking that I was in it, as, at that time, women were light in weight, and thin and lean, and did not use to eat much. So, those people did not feel the difference in the heaviness of the Howdah while lifting it, and they put it over the camel. At that time I was a young lady. They set the camel moving and proceeded on. I found my necklace after the army had gone, and came to their camp to find nobody. So, I went to the place where I used to stay, thinking that they would discover my absence and come back in my search. While in that state, I felt sleepy and slept. Safwan bin Muattal As-Sulami Adh-Dhakwani was behind the army and reached my abode in the morning. When he saw a sleeping person, he came to me, and he used to see me before veiling. So, I got up when I heard him saying, \"Inna lil-lah-wa inn a ilaihi rajiun (We are for Allah, and we will return to Him).\" He made his camel knell down. He got down from his camel, and put his leg on the front legs of the camel and then I rode and sat over it. Safwan set out walking, leading the camel by the rope till we reached the army who had halted to take rest at midday. Then whoever was meant for destruction, fell into destruction, (some people accused me falsely) and the leader of the false accusers was `Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul. After that we returned to Medina, and I became ill for one month while the people were spreading the forged statements of the false accusers. I was feeling during my ailment as if I were not receiving the usual kindness from the Prophet which I used to receive from him when I got sick. But he would come, greet and say, How is that (girl)? I did not know anything of what was going on till I recovered from my ailment and went out with Um Mistah to the Manasi where we used to answer the call of nature, and we used not to go to answer the call of nature except from night to night and that was before we had lavatories near to our houses. And this habit of ours was similar to the habit of the old Arabs in the open country (or away from houses). So. I and Um Mistah bint Ruhm went out walking. Um Mistah stumbled because of her long dress and on that she said, Let Mistah be ruined. I said, You are saying a bad word. Why are you abusing a man who took part in (the battle of) Badr? She said, O Hanata (you there) didnt you hear what they said? Then she told me the rumors of the false accusers. My sickness was aggravated, and when I returned home, Allahs Apostle came to me, and after greeting he said, How is that (girl)? I requested him to allow me to go to my parents. I wanted then to be sure of the news through them I Allahs Apostle allowed me, and I went to my parents and asked my mother, What are the people talking about? She said, O my daughter! Dont worry much about this matter. By Allah, never is there a charming woman loved by her husband who has other wives, but the women would forge false news about her. I said, Glorified be Allah! Are the people really taking of this matter? That night I kept on weeping and could not sleep till morning. In the morning Allahs Apostle called `Ali bin Abu Talib and Usama bin Zaid when he saw the Divine Inspiration delayed, to consul them about divorcing his wife (i.e. `Aisha). Usama bin Zaid said what he knew of the good reputation of his wives and added, O Allahs Apostle! Keep you wife, for, by Allah, we know nothing about her but good. `Ali bin Abu Talib said, O Allahs Apostle! Allah has no imposed restrictions on you, and there are many women other than she, yet you may ask the woman-servant who will tell you the truth. On that Allahs Apostle called Buraira and said, O Burair. Did you ever see anything which roused your suspicions about her? Buraira said, No, by Allah Who has sent you with the Truth, I have never seen in her anything faulty except that she is a girl of immature age, who sometimes sleeps and leaves the dough for the goats to eat. On that day Allahs Apostle ascended the pulpit and requested that somebody support him in punishing `Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul. Allahs Apostle said, Who will support me to punish that person (`Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul) who has hurt me by slandering the reputation of my family? By Allah, I know nothing about my family but good, and they have accused a person about whom I know nothing except good, and he never entered my house except in my company. Sa`d bin Mu`adh got up and said, O Allahs Apostle! by Allah, I will relieve you from him. If that man is from the tribe of the Aus, then we will chop his head off, and if he is from our brothers, the Khazraj, then order us, and we will fulfill your order. On that Sa`d bin Ubada, the chief of the Khazraj and before this incident, he had been a pious man, got up, motivated by his zeal for his tribe and said, By Allah, you have told a lie; you cannot kill him, and you will never be able to kill him. On that Usaid bin Al-Hadir got up and said (to Sa`d bin Ubada), By Allah! you are a liar. By Allah, we will kill him; and you are a hypocrite, defending the hypocrites. On this the two tribes of Aus and Khazraj got excited and were about to fight each other, while Allahs Apostle was standing on the pulpit. He got down and quieted them till they became silent and he kept quiet. On that day I kept on weeping so much so that neither did my tears stop, nor could I sleep. In the morning my parents were with me and I had wept for two nights and a day, till I thought my liver would burst from weeping. While they were sitting with me and I was weeping, an Ansari woman asked my permission to enter, and I allowed her to come in. She sat down and started weeping with me. While we were in this state, Allahs Apostle came and sat down and he had never sat with me since the day they forged the accusation. No revelation regarding my case came to him for a month. He recited Tashah-hud (i.e. None has the right to be worshipped but Allah and Muhammad is His Apostle) and then said, O `Aisha! I have been informed such-and-such about you; if you are innocent, then Allah will soon reveal your innocence, and if you have committed a sin, then repent to Allah and ask Him to forgive you, for when a person confesses his sin and asks Allah for forgiveness, Allah accepts his repentance. When Allahs Apostle finished his speech my tears ceased completely and there remained not even a single drop of it. I requested my father to reply to Allahs Apostle on my behalf. My father said, By Allah, I do not know what to say to Allahs Apostle. I said to my mother, Talk to Allahs Apostle on my behalf. She said, By Allah, I do not know what to say to Allahs Apostle. I was a young girl and did not have much knowledge of the Quran. I said. I know, by Allah, that you have listened to what people are saying and that has been planted in your minds and you have taken it as a truth. Now, if I told you that I am innocent and Allah knows that I am innocent, you would not believe me and if I confessed to you falsely that I am guilty, and Allah knows that I am innocent you would believe me. By Allah, I dont compare my situation with you except to the situation of Josephs father (i.e. Jacob) who said, So (for me) patience is most fitting against that which you assert and it is Allah (Alone) whose help can be sought. Then I turned to the other side of my bed hoping that Allah would prove my innocence. By Allah I never thought that Allah would reveal Divine Inspiration in my case, as I considered myself too inferior to be talked of in the Holy Quran. I had hoped that Allahs Apostle might have a dream in which Allah would prove my innocence. By Allah, Allahs Apostle had not got up and nobody had left the house before the Divine Inspiration came to Allahs Apostle. So, there overtook him the same state which used to overtake him, (when he used to have, on being inspired divinely). He was sweating so much so that the drops of the sweat were dropping like pearls though it was a (cold) wintry day. When that state of Allahs Apostle was over, he was smiling and the first word he said, `Aisha! Thank Allah, for Allah has declared your innocence. My mother told me to go to Allahs Apostle . I replied, By Allah I will not go to him and will not thank but Allah. So Allah revealed: \"Verily! They who spread the slander are a gang among you . . .\" (24.11) When Allah gave the declaration of my Innocence, Abu Bakr, who used to provide for Mistah bin Uthatha for he was his relative, said, By Allah, I will never provide Mistah with anything because of what he said about Aisha. But Allah later revealed: -- \"And let not those who are good and wealthy among you swear not to help their kinsmen, those in need and those who left their homes in Allahs Cause. Let them forgive and overlook. Do you not wish that Allah should forgive you? Verily! Allah is Oft-forgiving, Most Merciful.\" (24.22) After that Abu Bakr said, Yes ! By Allah! I like that Allah should forgive me, and resumed helping Mistah whom he used to help before. Allahs Apostle also asked Zainab bint Jahsh (i.e. the Prophets wife about me saying, What do you know and what did you see? She replied, O Allahs Apostle! I refrain to claim hearing or seeing what I have not heard or seen. By Allah, I know nothing except goodness about Aisha.\" Aisha further added \"Zainab was competing with me (in her beauty and the Prophets love), yet Allah protected her (from being malicious), for she had piety.\"<D>It was narraterd from Jabir bin Abdullah that, during the year of the Conquest, while he was in Makkah, he heard the Messenger of Allah say:\"Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, and His Messenger have forbidden the sale of alcohol, dead meat, pigs and idols.\" It was said to him: \"O Messenger of Allah, what do you think of their fat of dead animals, for it is used to caulk ships, it is daubed on animal skins, and people use it to light their lamps?\" He said: \"No, it is unlawful.\" Then the Messenger of Allah said: \"May Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, curse the Jews, for Allah forbade them the fat (of dead animals) but they rendered it, sold it, and consumed its price.\"<D>Then He explained to them further, saying: (A day) on a Day (when He will call you) when Seraphiel will call you upon the blowing of the trumpet (and ye will answer with His praise) you will answer the caller of Allah by His command, (and ye will think that ye have tarried but a little while) you will think that you havestayed in your graves but a short time.<D>(What then is your opinion of the Lord of the Worlds) what do you think He will do to you if you worship other than Him?<D>The following was revealed about Abu Jahl Ibn Hisham, al-Walid Ibn al-Mughirah and Utbah and Shaybah the sons of Rabiah who had duals with Ali Ibn Abi Talib, may Allah be well pleased with him, Hamzah IbnAbd al-Muttalib, the uncle of the Prophet (pbuh) and Ubaydah Ibn al-Harth Ibn Abd al-Muttalib on the Dayof Badr; some of them boasted to others, and so Allah said: (Or do those who do ill deeds) in their state of associating partners with Allah (imagine that they can outstrip Us) that they will evade Our punishment: (Evil (for them) is that which they decide) evil is that which they judge and think for themselves.", "Generated_Answer": "I understand your concern and the doubts you're experiencing regarding urine splashes during urination and how it might affect your Namaz (prayer). I'll provide guidance based on Islamic principles and practical advice to alleviate your worries.\n\n1. **Precautions and Wudhu/Namaz Validity**: You're already taking precautions by placing tissue in the toilet to minimize splashes, which is a good practice. Islamic teachings emphasize the importance of cleanliness and purification before performing Namaz.\n\n2. **Dealing with Doubts**: In Islam, excessive doubts (known as \"waswas\" in Arabic) are considered a test of faith. The general advice for dealing with such doubts is not to act upon them excessively, as this can lead to an unending cycle of uncertainty.\n\n3. **Checking for Urine Splashes**: If you feel something on your legs while urinating, and you're unsure whether it's urine or not, the key principle here is not to be overly scrupulous. Islam teaches us to avoid unnecessary actions or investigations that can lead to further doubts.\n\n4. **Guidance on Handling Doubts**: The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) advised against acting on doubts when he said, \"Leave that which makes you in doubt for that which does not make you in doubt\" (Tirmidhi). This principle can be applied here. If you've taken the necessary precautions and still experience doubts, it's recommended not to investigate further by touching the area to check for wetness.\n\n5. **Prayer Validity**: If you've performed Wudhu correctly and taken reasonable precautions to avoid urine splashes, your Namaz is considered valid. Islam is a religion of ease, not hardship. Constantly checking and re-checking due to doubts can be considered hardship.\n\n6. **Managing \"Waswas\"**: To manage your doubts, try to distract yourself from these thoughts during and after urination. Focus on your daily activities and duties, and try not to dwell on these doubts. If the thoughts persist and interfere with your daily life or prayers, consider speaking with a knowledgeable person or a counselor who can provide support.\n\n7. **Conclusion**: Take the necessary precautions before and during urination to minimize the risk of splashing. If doubts arise, avoid investigating them further. Have faith that you've done your best to follow the guidelines, and your Namaz should be considered valid.\n\nBy adopting a balanced approach between taking necessary precautions and not indulging in excessive doubts, you can alleviate your worries and perform your religious duties with more peace of mind."}

Abu Musa then said: How will you do with the Quranic version (about tayammum) in the chapter al-Maidah which says: \"... and you find no water, then go to clean, high ground\" (5:6)? Abd Allah (b. Masud) then said: If they (the people) are granted concession in this respect, they might perform tayammum with pure earth when water is cold. Abu Musa said: For this (reason) you forbade it ? He said: Yes. Abu Musa then said: Did you not hear what Ammar said to Umar ? (He said): The Messenger of Allah () sent me on some errand. I had seminal emission and I did not find water. Therefore, I rolled on the ground just as an animal rolls down. I then came to the Prophet () and made a mention of that to him. He said: It would have been enough for you to do thus. Then he struck the ground with his hands and shook them off and then stuck the right hand with his left hand and his left hand with his right hand (and wiped) over his hands (up to the wrist) and wiped his face. Abd Allah then said to him: Did you not see that Umar was not satisfied with the statement of Ammar ?<D>Ammar bin Yasir narrated that :the Prophet ordered him to perform Tayammum by rubbing his face and two palms.<D>It is reported that Ata did not approve of performing ablution with milk and nabidh and said:tayammum is more my liking (than performing ablution with milk and nabidh).<D>(And that He it is Who enricheth) He made Himself independent of the need for created beings (and contenteth) and He made His slaves needy for Him; it is also said that this means: He made some rich with gold and silver and others content with the possession of camels, bovines and sheep.<D>(And if ye fear that ye will not deal fairly by the orphans) and if you fear that you will not preserve orphans wealth, you should also fear not dealing fairly with women in relation to providing sustenance and apportionment. This was because they used to marry as many women as they liked, as many as nine or ten. Qays Ibn al-Harth for example had eight wives. Allah forbade them from doing so and prohibited them from marrying more than four wives, saying: (marry of the women, who seem good to you) marry that which Allah has made lawful for you, (two or three or four) marry one, two, three or four but do not marry more than four wives; (and if ye fear that ye cannot do justice) to four wives in relation to apportionment and providing sustenance (then one (only)) then marry only one free woman (or that your right hands possess) of captives, and in that case you do not owe them any apportionment, and they need not observe any waiting period. (Thus it) marrying just one woman (is more likely that ye will not do injustice) that you will not incline to some at the expense of others or that you transgress regarding the provision of sustenanceand apportionment to four wives.<D>(Know that Allah is severe in punishment) towards him who declares lawful that which Allah has made unlawful, (but that Allah (also) is Forgiving) He overlooks mistakes, (Merciful) towards the person who repents.", "Generated_Answer": "A: 1.

And Allah Taala ( ) knows best", "Document": "The tradition mentioned above has also been narrated by Al ‘Umm Athiyah from the Prophet () through a different chain of narrators. The tradition narrated by Yazid bin Harun from Hisham does perfectly correspond to the tradition transmitted by Ibrahim bin Tahman and ‘Abd Allah Al Shami from Hisham. The narrator Al Misma’I reported Yazid as saying “I do not know but that he said “she should not dye herself.” To this the narrator Harun added “She should not wear colored clothes except one of the types made of dyed yarn.”<D>Narrated Aisha, Ummul Muminin:By Allah, we did not know whether we should take off the clothes of the Messenger of Allah () as we took off the clothes of our dead, or wash him while his clothes were on him. When they (the people) differed among themselves, Allah cast slumber over them until every one of them had put his chin on his chest. Then a speaker spoke from a side of the house, and they did not know who he was: Wash the Prophet () while his clothes are on him. So they stood round the Prophet () and washed him while he had his shirt on him. They poured water on his shirt, and rubbed him with his shirt and not with their hands. Aisha used to say: If I had known beforehand about my affair what I found out later, none would have washed him except his wives.<D>Ubayy b. Ka’b reported :The Messenger of Allah (May peace be upon him) made a concession in the early days of Islam on account of the paucity of clothes that one should not take a bath if one has sexual intercourse (and has no seminal emission).

The washing machine's agitation, detergent, and water temperature play more significant roles in cleaning clothes.\n\nThe fact that your raincoat, made of waterproof material, was dripping while the rest of the clothes were wet but not dripping, can be attributed to the nature of the material. Waterproof or water-resistant materials are designed to prevent water from penetrating through, so when they get wet, the water tends to stay on the surface, making the item appear wetter or more dripping than others.\n\nAs long as your washing machine was functioning properly, used the right amount and type of detergent, and the wash cycle was appropriate for the clothes being washed, your clothes should be considered clean. The waterproof raincoat might not have been as clean as the other items if water and detergent couldn't penetrate its fabric as easily, but this doesn't necessarily mean the other clothes aren't clean.\n\nHowever, to be sure about the cleanliness, you might want to inspect your clothes visually and through touch for any remaining dirt or stains. If they feel clean, look clean, and there's no lingering dirt or odor, they are likely clean.\n\nFor the raincoat, you might need to consider a different washing method or a specialized detergent that can help clean waterproof or water-resistant fabrics more effectively. Some waterproof materials may require hand washing, or a specific cycle that ensures they're cleaned without damaging their waterproof coating. Always check the care label on your raincoat for specific washing instructions."}
{"Question": "If a person sees a young woman she knows doing something haram with another boy (right infront of her eyes), does she have to tell the girls parents? Should she say nothing because she was the only one who saw?? --T--", "Answer": "Al-Salam alaykumIn such a case it is necessary that she fulfils her responsibility of stopping evil by doing what is in her capacity i.e. telling those who will be able to effect some reform viz. the girls parents. This will not be regarded as ghibah (backbiting) as the intention is to reform. [Faraz adds: Imam Abul Layth al-Samarqandi mentioned that things said out of genuine concern are not backbiting (ghiba), as in Sharhal-Tariqa al-Muhammadiyya and elsewhere", "Document": "Sa, id b. jubair reported that it was said to Ibn Abbas that Nauf al-Bikali was of the opinion that Moses who went in search of knowledge was not the Moses of Bani Israil. He said:Said, did you hear it from him? I said: Yes. Thereupon he said that Nauf had not stated the fact. Ubayy b. Kab narrated to us that he had heard Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: Moses had been delivering sermons to his people. And he made this remark: No person upon the earth has better knowledge than I or nothing better than mine. Thereupon Allah revealed to him: I know one who is better than you (in knowledge) or there is a person on the earth having more knowledge than you. Thereupon he said: My Lord, direct me to him. It was said to him: Keep a salted fish as a provision for journey. The place where that fish would be lost (there you will find that man). So he set forth and a young slave along with him until they came to a place Sakhra. but he did not find any clue. So he proceeded on and left that young man there. The fish began to stir in water and the water assumed the form of an ark over the fish. The young man said: I should meet Allahs Apostle (peace be upon him) and inform him, but he was made to forget and when they had gone beyond that place, he (Moses) said to the young man: Bring breakfast. We have been exhausted because of the journey, and he (Moses) was not exhausted until he had crossed that (particular) place (where he had) to meet Khadir, and the youth was reminded and said: Did you not see that as we reached Sakhra I forgot the fish and it is satan alone who has made me forgetful of it? It is strange that he has been able to find way in the ocean too. He said: This is what we sought for us. They returned retracing their steps, and he (his companion) pointed to him the location (where) the fish (had been lost). Moses began to search him there. He suddenly saw Khadir wrapped in a cloth and lying on his back. He said to him: As-Salamu-Alaikum. He removed the cloth from his face and said: Wa Alaikum-us-Salam! Who are you? He said: I am Moses. He said: Who Moses? He said: Moses Of Bani Israil. He said: What brought you here? He said: I have come so that you may teach me what you have been taught of righteousness. He said: You shall have to bear with me, and how can you have patience about a thing of which you have no comprehensive knowledge? You will not have patience when you see me doing a thing I have been ordered to do. He said: If Allah pleases, you will find me patient, nor shall I disobey you in aught. Khadir said: If you follow me, dont ask me about anything until I explain it to you. So they went on until they embarked upon a boat. He (Khadir) made a hole in that. Thereupon he (Moses) said: You have done this so that you may drown the persons sitting in the boat. You have done something grievous. Thereupon he said: Did I not tell you that you will not be able to bear with me? Thereupon he (Moses) said: Blame me not for what I forgot and be not hard upon me for what I did. (Khadir gave him another chance.) So they went on until they reached a place where boys were playing. He went to one of them and caught holdof one (apparently) at random and killed him. Moses (peace be upon him) felt agitated and said: You have killed an innocent person not guilty of slaying another. You have done something aboininable. Thereupon Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: May Allah have mercy upon us and Moses. Had he shown patience he would have seen wonderful things, but fear of blame, with respect to his companion, seized him and he said: If I ask anything after this, keep not company with me. You will then have a valid excuse in my case, and had he (Moses) shown patience he would have seen many wonderful things. He (the narrator) said: Whenever he (the Holy Prophet) made mention of any Prophet, he always said: May there be mercy of Allah upon us and upon my brother so and so. They, however, proceeded on until they came to the inhabitants of a village who were very miserly. They went to the meeting places and asked for hospitality but they refused to show any hospitality to them. They both found in that village a wall which was about to fall. He (Khadir) set it right. Thereupon he (Moses) said: If you so liked. you could get wages for it. Thereupon he said: This is the partince, of ways between me and you, and, taking hold of his cloth, he said: Now I will explain to you the real significance (of all these acts) for which you could not show patience. As for the boat, it belonged to the poor people working on the river and I intended to damage it for there was ahead of them (a king) who seized boats by force. (When he came) to catch hold of it he found it a damaged boat, so he spared it (and later on) it was set right with wood. So far as the boy is concerned, he has been, by very nature, an unbeliever, whereas his parents loved him very much. Had he grown up he would have involved them in wrongdoing and unbelief, so we wished that their Lord should give them in its place one better in purity and close to mercy. And as for the wall it belonged to two orphan boys in the city and there was beneath it a (treasure) belongin to them,... up to the last verse. This hadith has been transmitted on the authority of Abu Ishaq.<D>Narrated Aisha:(The wife of the Prophet) Whenever Allahs Apostle intended to go on a journey, he used to draw lots among his wives and would take with him the one on whom the lot had fallen. Once he drew lots when he wanted to carry out a Ghazwa, and the lot came upon me. So I proceeded with Allahs Apostle after Allahs order of veiling (the women) had been revealed and thus I was carried in my howdah (on a camel) and dismounted while still in it. We carried on our journey, and when Allahs Apostle had finished his Ghazwa and returned and we approached Medina, Allahs Apostle ordered to proceed at night. When the army was ordered to resume the homeward journey, I got up and walked on till I left the army (camp) behind. When I had answered the call of nature, I went towards my howdah, but behold ! A necklace of mine made of Jaz Azfar (a kind of black bead) was broken and I looked for it and my search for it detained me. The group of people who used to carry me, came and carried my howdah on to the back of my camel on which I was riding, considering that I was therein. At that time women were light in weight and were not fleshy for they used to eat little (food), so those people did not feel the lightness of the howdah while raising it up, and I was still a young lady. They drove away the camel and proceeded. Then I found my necklace after the army had gone. I came to their camp but found nobody therein so I went to the place where I used to stay, thinking that they would miss me and come back in my search. While I was sitting at my place, I felt sleepy and slept. Safwan bin Al-Muattil As-Sulami Adh- Dhakw-ani was behind the army. He had started in the last part of the night and reached my stationing place in the morning and saw the figure of a sleeping person. He came to me and recognized me on seeing me for he used to see me before veiling. I got up because of his saying: \"Inna Li l-lahi wa inna ilaihi rajiun,\" which he uttered on recognizing me. I covered my face with my garment, and by Allah, he did not say to me a single word except, \"Inna Li l-lahi wa inna ilaihi rajiun,\" till he made his shecamel kneel down whereupon he trod on its forelegs and I mounted it. Then Safwan set out, leading the she-camel that was carrying me, till we met the army while they were resting during the hot midday. Then whoever was meant for destruction, fell in destruction, and the leader of the Ifk (forged statement) was `Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul. After this we arrived at Medina and I became ill for one month while the people were spreading the forged statements of the people of the Ifk, and I was not aware of anything thereof. But what aroused my doubt while I was sick, was that I was no longer receiving from Allahs Apostle the same kindness as I used to receive when I fell sick. Allahs Apostle would enter upon me, say a greeting and add, \"How is that (lady)?\" and then depart. That aroused my suspicion but I was not aware of the propagated evil till I recovered from my ailment. I went out with Um Mistah to answer the call of nature towards Al-Manasi, the place where we used to relieve ourselves, and used not to go out for this purpose except from night to night, and that was before we had lavatories close to our houses. And this habit of ours was similar to the habit of the old Arabs (in the deserts or in the tents) concerning the evacuation of the bowels, for we considered it troublesome and harmful to take lavatories in the houses. So I went out with Um Mistah who was the daughter of Abi Ruhm bin `Abd Manaf, and her mother was daughter of Sakhr bin Amir who was the aunt of Abi Bakr As-Siddiq, and her son was Mistah bin Uthatha. When we had finished our affair, Um Mistah and I came back towards my house. Um Mistah stumbled over her robe whereupon she said, \"Let Mistah be ruined ! \" I said to her, \"What a bad word you have said! Do you abuse a man who has taken part in the Battle of Badr? She said, \"O you there! Didnt you hear what he has said?\" I said, \"And what did he say?\" She then told me the statement of the people of the Ifk (forged statement) which added to my ailment. When I returned home, Allahs Apostle came to me, and after greeting, he said, \"How is that (lady)?\" I said, \"Will you allow me to go to my parents?\" At that time I intended to be sure of the news through them. Allahs Apostle allowed me and I went to my parents and asked my mother, \"O my mother! What are the people talking about?\" My mother said, \"O my daughter! Take it easy, for by Allah, there is no charming lady who is loved by her husband who has other wives as well, but that those wives would find fault with her.\" I said, \"Subhan Allah! Did the people really talk about that?\" That night I kept on weeping the whole night till the morning. My tears never stopped, nor did I sleep, and morning broke while I was still weeping, Allahs Apostle called `Ali bin Abi Talib and Usama bin Zaid when the Divine Inspiration delayed, in order to consult them as to the idea of divorcing his wife. Usama bin Zaid told Allahs Apostle of what he knew about the innocence of his wife and of his affection he kept for her. He said, \"O Allahs Apostle! She is your wife, and we do not know anything about her except good.\" But `Ali bin Abi Talib said, \"O Allahs Apostle! Allah does not impose restrictions on you; and there are plenty of women other than her. If you however, ask (her) slave girl, she will tell you the truth.\" `Aisha added: So Allahs Apostle called for Barira and said, \"O Barira! Did you ever see anything which might have aroused your suspicion? (as regards Aisha). Barira said, \"By Allah Who has sent you with the truth, I have never seen anything regarding Aisha which I would blame her for except that she is a girl of immature age who sometimes sleeps and leaves the dough of her family unprotected so that the domestic goats come and eat it.\" So Allahs Apostle got up (and addressed) the people an asked for somebody who would take revenge on `Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul then. Allahs Apostle, while on the pulpit, said, \"O Muslims! Who will help me against a man who has hurt me by slandering my family? By Allah, I know nothing except good about my family, and people have blamed a man of whom I know nothing except good, and he never used to visit my family except with me,\" Sa`d bin Mu`adh Al-Ansari got up and said, \"O Allahs Apostle! By Allah, I will relieve you from him. If he be from the tribe of (Bani) Al-Aus, then I will chop his head off; and if he be from our brethren, the Khazraj, then you give us your order and we will obey it.\" On that, Sa`d bin Ubada got up, and he was the chief of the Khazraj, and before this incident he had been a pious man but he was incited by his zeal for his tribe. He said to Sa`d (bin Mu`adh), \"By Allah the Eternal, you have told a lie! You shall not kill him and you will never be able to kill him!\" On that, Usaid bin Hudair, the cousin of Sa`d (bin Mu`adh) got up and said to Sa`d bin Ubada, \"You are a liar! By Allah the Eternal, we will surely kill him; and you are a hypocrite defending the hypocrites!\" So the two tribes of Al-Aus and Al-Khazraj got excited till they were on the point of fighting with each other while Allahs Apostle was standing on the pulpit. Allahs Apostle continued quietening them till they became silent whereupon he became silent too. On that day I kept on weeping so much that neither did my tears stop, nor could I sleep. In the morning my parents were with me, and I had wept for two nights and a day without sleeping and with incessant tears till they thought that my liver would burst with weeping. While they were with me and I was weeping, an Ansari woman asked permission to see me. I admitted her and she sat and started weeping with me. While I was in that state, Allahs Apostle came to us, greeted, and sat down,. He had never sat with me since the day what was said, was said. He had stayed a month without receiving any Divine Inspiration concerning my case. Allahs Apostle recited the Tashahhud after he had sat down, and then said, \"Thereafter, O `Aisha! I have been informed such and-such a thing about you; and if you are innocent, Allah will reveal your innocence, and if you have committed a sin, then ask for Allahs forgiveness and repent to Him, for when a slave confesses his sin and then repents to Allah, Allah accepts his repentance.\" When Allahs Apostle had finished his speech, my tears ceased completely so that I no longer felt even a drop thereof. Then I said to my father, \"Reply to Allahs Apostle on my behalf as to what he said.\" He said, \"By Allah, I do not know what to say to Allahs Apostle.\" Then I said to my mother, \"Reply to Allahs Apostle.\" She said, \"I do not know what to say to Allahs Apostle.\" Still a young girl as I was and though I had little knowledge of Quran, I said, \"By Allah, I know that you heard this story (of the Ifk) so much so that it has been planted in your minds and you have believed it. So now, if I tell you that I am innocent, and Allah knows that I am innocent, you will not believe me; and if I confess something, and Allah knows that I am innocent of it, you will believe me. By Allah, I cannot find of you an example except that of Josephs father: \"So (for me) patience is most fitting against that which you assert and it is Allah (Alone) Whose help can be sought. Then I turned away and lay on my bed, and at that time I knew that I was innocent and that Allah would reveal my innocence. But by Allah, I never thought that Allah would sent down about my affair, Divine Inspiration that would be recited (forever), as I considered myself too unworthy to be talked of by Allah with something that was to be recited: but I hoped that Allahs Apostle might have a vision in which Allah would prove my innocence. By Allah, Allahs Apostle had not left his seat and nobody had left the house when the Divine Inspiration came to Allahs Apostle . So there overtook him the same hard condition which used to overtake him (when he was Divinely Inspired) so that the drops of his sweat were running down, like pearls, though it was a (cold) winter day, and that was because of the heaviness of the Statement which was revealed to him. When that state of Allahs Apostle was over, and he was smiling when he was relieved, the first word he said was, \"Aisha, Allah has declared your innocence.\" My mother said to me, \"Get up and go to him.\" I said, \"By Allah, I will not go to him and I will not thank anybody but Allah.\" So Allah revealed: \"Verily! They who spread the Slander are a gang among you. Think it not....\" (24.11-20). When Allah revealed this to confirm my innocence, Abu Bakr As-Siddiq who used to provide for Mistah bin Uthatha because of the latters kinship to him and his poverty, said, \"By Allah, I will never provide for Mistah anything after what he has said about Aisha\". So Allah revealed: (continued...) (continuing... 1): -6.274:... ... \"Let not those among you who are good and are wealthy swear not to give (help) to their kinsmen, those in need, and those who have left their homes for Allahs Cause. Let them Pardon and forgive (i.e. do not punish them). Do you not love that should forgive you? Verily Allah is Oft-forgiving. Most Merciful.\" (24.22) Abu Bakr said, \"Yes, by Allah, I wish that Allah should forgive me.\" So he resumed giving Mistah the aid he used to give him before and said, \"By Allah, I will never withold it from him at all.\" Aisha further said: Allahs Apostle also asked Zainab bint Jahsh about my case. He said, \"O Zainab! What have you seen?\" She replied, \"O Allahs Apostle! I protect my hearing and my sight (by refraining from telling lies). I know nothing but good (about Aisha).\" Of all the wives of Allahs Apostle, it was Zainab who aspired to receive from him the same favor as I used to receive, yet, Allah saved her (from telling lies) because of her piety. But her sister, Hamna, kept on fighting on her behalf so she was destroyed as were those who invented and spread the slander.<D>Narrated Aisha:(the wife of the Prophet) \"Whenever Allahs Apostle intended to go on a journey, he would draw lots amongst his wives and would take with him the one upon whom the lot fell. During a Ghazwa of his, he drew lots amongst us and the lot fell upon me, and I proceeded with him after Allah had decreed the use of the veil by women. I was carried in a Howdah (on the camel) and dismounted while still in it. When Allahs Apostle was through with his Ghazwa and returned home, and we approached the city of Medina, Allahs Apostle ordered us to proceed at night. When the order of setting off was given, I walked till I was past the army to answer the call of nature. After finishing I returned (to the camp) to depart (with the others) and suddenly realized that my necklace over my chest was missing. So, I returned to look for it and was delayed because of that. The people who used to carry me on the camel, came to my Howdah and put it on the back of the camel, thinking that I was in it, as, at that time, women were light in weight, and thin and lean, and did not use to eat much. So, those people did not feel the difference in the heaviness of the Howdah while lifting it, and they put it over the camel. At that time I was a young lady. They set the camel moving and proceeded on. I found my necklace after the army had gone, and came to their camp to find nobody. So, I went to the place where I used to stay, thinking that they would discover my absence and come back in my search. While in that state, I felt sleepy and slept. Safwan bin Muattal As-Sulami Adh-Dhakwani was behind the army and reached my abode in the morning. When he saw a sleeping person, he came to me, and he used to see me before veiling. So, I got up when I heard him saying, \"Inna lil-lah-wa inn a ilaihi rajiun (We are for Allah, and we will return to Him).\" He made his camel knell down. He got down from his camel, and put his leg on the front legs of the camel and then I rode and sat over it. Safwan set out walking, leading the camel by the rope till we reached the army who had halted to take rest at midday. Then whoever was meant for destruction, fell into destruction, (some people accused me falsely) and the leader of the false accusers was `Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul. After that we returned to Medina, and I became ill for one month while the people were spreading the forged statements of the false accusers. I was feeling during my ailment as if I were not receiving the usual kindness from the Prophet which I used to receive from him when I got sick. But he would come, greet and say, How is that (girl)? I did not know anything of what was going on till I recovered from my ailment and went out with Um Mistah to the Manasi where we used to answer the call of nature, and we used not to go to answer the call of nature except from night to night and that was before we had lavatories near to our houses. And this habit of ours was similar to the habit of the old Arabs in the open country (or away from houses). So. I and Um Mistah bint Ruhm went out walking. Um Mistah stumbled because of her long dress and on that she said, Let Mistah be ruined. I said, You are saying a bad word. Why are you abusing a man who took part in (the battle of) Badr? She said, O Hanata (you there) didnt you hear what they said? Then she told me the rumors of the false accusers. My sickness was aggravated, and when I returned home, Allahs Apostle came to me, and after greeting he said, How is that (girl)? I requested him to allow me to go to my parents. I wanted then to be sure of the news through them I Allahs Apostle allowed me, and I went to my parents and asked my mother, What are the people talking about? She said, O my daughter! Dont worry much about this matter. By Allah, never is there a charming woman loved by her husband who has other wives, but the women would forge false news about her. I said, Glorified be Allah! Are the people really taking of this matter? That night I kept on weeping and could not sleep till morning. In the morning Allahs Apostle called `Ali bin Abu Talib and Usama bin Zaid when he saw the Divine Inspiration delayed, to consul them about divorcing his wife (i.e. `Aisha). Usama bin Zaid said what he knew of the good reputation of his wives and added, O Allahs Apostle! Keep you wife, for, by Allah, we know nothing about her but good. `Ali bin Abu Talib said, O Allahs Apostle! Allah has no imposed restrictions on you, and there are many women other than she, yet you may ask the woman-servant who will tell you the truth. On that Allahs Apostle called Buraira and said, O Burair. Did you ever see anything which roused your suspicions about her? Buraira said, No, by Allah Who has sent you with the Truth, I have never seen in her anything faulty except that she is a girl of immature age, who sometimes sleeps and leaves the dough for the goats to eat. On that day Allahs Apostle ascended the pulpit and requested that somebody support him in punishing `Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul. Allahs Apostle said, Who will support me to punish that person (`Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul) who has hurt me by slandering the reputation of my family? By Allah, I know nothing about my family but good, and they have accused a person about whom I know nothing except good, and he never entered my house except in my company. Sa`d bin Mu`adh got up and said, O Allahs Apostle! by Allah, I will relieve you from him. If that man is from the tribe of the Aus, then we will chop his head off, and if he is from our brothers, the Khazraj, then order us, and we will fulfill your order. On that Sa`d bin Ubada, the chief of the Khazraj and before this incident, he had been a pious man, got up, motivated by his zeal for his tribe and said, By Allah, you have told a lie; you cannot kill him, and you will never be able to kill him. On that Usaid bin Al-Hadir got up and said (to Sa`d bin Ubada), By Allah! you are a liar. By Allah, we will kill him; and you are a hypocrite, defending the hypocrites. On this the two tribes of Aus and Khazraj got excited and were about to fight each other, while Allahs Apostle was standing on the pulpit. He got down and quieted them till they became silent and he kept quiet. On that day I kept on weeping so much so that neither did my tears stop, nor could I sleep. In the morning my parents were with me and I had wept for two nights and a day, till I thought my liver would burst from weeping. While they were sitting with me and I was weeping, an Ansari woman asked my permission to enter, and I allowed her to come in. She sat down and started weeping with me. While we were in this state, Allahs Apostle came and sat down and he had never sat with me since the day they forged the accusation. No revelation regarding my case came to him for a month. He recited Tashah-hud (i.e. None has the right to be worshipped but Allah and Muhammad is His Apostle) and then said, O `Aisha! I have been informed such-and-such about you; if you are innocent, then Allah will soon reveal your innocence, and if you have committed a sin, then repent to Allah and ask Him to forgive you, for when a person confesses his sin and asks Allah for forgiveness, Allah accepts his repentance. When Allahs Apostle finished his speech my tears ceased completely and there remained not even a single drop of it. I requested my father to reply to Allahs Apostle on my behalf. My father said, By Allah, I do not know what to say to Allahs Apostle. I said to my mother, Talk to Allahs Apostle on my behalf. She said, By Allah, I do not know what to say to Allahs Apostle. I was a young girl and did not have much knowledge of the Quran. I said. I know, by Allah, that you have listened to what people are saying and that has been planted in your minds and you have taken it as a truth. Now, if I told you that I am innocent and Allah knows that I am innocent, you would not believe me and if I confessed to you falsely that I am guilty, and Allah knows that I am innocent you would believe me. By Allah, I dont compare my situation with you except to the situation of Josephs father (i.e. Jacob) who said, So (for me) patience is most fitting against that which you assert and it is Allah (Alone) whose help can be sought. Then I turned to the other side of my bed hoping that Allah would prove my innocence. By Allah I never thought that Allah would reveal Divine Inspiration in my case, as I considered myself too inferior to be talked of in the Holy Quran. I had hoped that Allahs Apostle might have a dream in which Allah would prove my innocence. By Allah, Allahs Apostle had not got up and nobody had left the house before the Divine Inspiration came to Allahs Apostle. So, there overtook him the same state which used to overtake him, (when he used to have, on being inspired divinely). He was sweating so much so that the drops of the sweat were dropping like pearls though it was a (cold) wintry day. When that state of Allahs Apostle was over, he was smiling and the first word he said, `Aisha! Thank Allah, for Allah has declared your innocence. My mother told me to go to Allahs Apostle . I replied, By Allah I will not go to him and will not thank but Allah. So Allah revealed: \"Verily! They who spread the slander are a gang among you . . .\" (24.11) When Allah gave the declaration of my Innocence, Abu Bakr, who used to provide for Mistah bin Uthatha for he was his relative, said, By Allah, I will never provide Mistah with anything because of what he said about Aisha. But Allah later revealed: -- \"And let not those who are good and wealthy among you swear not to help their kinsmen, those in need and those who left their homes in Allahs Cause. Let them forgive and overlook. Do you not wish that Allah should forgive you? Verily! Allah is Oft-forgiving, Most Merciful.\" (24.22) After that Abu Bakr said, Yes ! By Allah! I like that Allah should forgive me, and resumed helping Mistah whom he used to help before. Allahs Apostle also asked Zainab bint Jahsh (i.e. the Prophets wife about me saying, What do you know and what did you see? She replied, O Allahs Apostle! I refrain to claim hearing or seeing what I have not heard or seen. By Allah, I know nothing except goodness about Aisha.\" Aisha further added \"Zainab was competing with me (in her beauty and the Prophets love), yet Allah protected her (from being malicious), for she had piety.\"<D>(And if ye wish to exchange one wife for another) He says: If you wish to marry a woman and divorce one you are already married to, or marry a woman in addition to the one you are already married to (and ye have given unto one of them a sum of money (however great)) a dowry, (take nothing from it) from the dowry.

The situation you've described involves witnessing a private act that is considered haram. The decision on whether to inform the parents depends on several factors and Islamic principles.\n\nFirstly, it's essential to verify the situation as much as possible to avoid false accusations or misunderstandings. Islam places a high value on not making assumptions or accusations without clear evidence.\n\nThere are different opinions among Islamic scholars on this matter:\n\n1. **Some scholars suggest that if the act is private and not causing public harm or disturbance, it might be more advisable to advise the individuals directly if possible, or to keep the matter confidential out of mercy and to avoid causing unnecessary harm or embarrassment to those involved.** This approach is based on the principle of not publicizing someone's private wrongdoings.\n\n2. **Others might argue that if the act could lead to significant harm (spiritual, physical, or emotional) to the individuals involved, or if it's a repeated behavior, it might be necessary to inform their guardians or parents as a measure to protect them and to offer an opportunity for intervention.** The intention here is to prevent harm and to guide the individuals towards righteousness.\n\nBefore taking any action, consider the following steps:\n\n- **Reflect on your intentions:** Are you doing this to protect the individuals involved, or is there an element of gossip or harm in your intention?\n- **Consider the potential outcomes:** Informing the parents could lead to various reactions, ranging from gratitude for your concern to denial, anger, or even harm to the individuals involved. Be prepared for different outcomes.\n- **Choose the most compassionate and least harmful approach:** Directly advising the individuals if they are receptive, or discreetly informing their guardians, might be more effective and less harmful than publicizing the issue.\n- **Seek guidance:** If possible, consult with a trusted, knowledgeable Islamic scholar or a wise, experienced individual who understands the context and the individuals involved.\n\nUltimately, the decision should be guided by the principles of Islam that emphasize compassion, justice, and the prevention of harm. The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) said, \"There is a charity (sadaqah) to be given for every part of the human body, and for every day on which the sun rises. Doing justice between two people is a charity...\" (Narrated by"}

Here are a few steps you can take to address your concerns:\n\n1. **Contact the Laundry**: Reach out to the laundry service you used and ask them about their process for your clothes. They should be able to tell you whether they washed or dry cleaned your items.\n\n2. **Check the Clothes**: Inspect your clothes when you get them back. Sometimes, you can tell by the smell or feel if they were dry cleaned. Dry cleaned clothes often have a distinct chemical smell.\n\n3. **Ask About Their Policy**: If you find out that they did dry clean your clothes instead of washing them, ask them about their policy on following customer instructions. Reputable businesses usually have protocols in place to minimize such mistakes.\n\n4. **Consider a Different Service**: If you're not satisfied with their response or if this is not the first time you've experienced a miscommunication, you might want to consider taking your business to a different laundry service.\n\n5. **Clarify Instructions**: When you give clothes to a laundry service, it's a good idea to clearly write your instructions on the tag or receipt, and verbally confirm with the staff. This can help prevent misunderstandings.\n\nIf your clothes were indeed dry cleaned instead of washed, and you believe this was against your instructions, you might be able to request that they re-service your clothes as requested.

This is the position of Imam Abu Hanifa himself. Later scholars said that the fatwa was on the position of Imam Muhammad ibn al-Hasan al-Shaybani, Abu Hanifas student, that all alcohol is najis and haram, even in small quantities, because of widespread fitna.

Despite this, you noticed 2 specks of urine on your left fingers afterward. The concern here is whether it's possible for urine specks to be overlooked completely.\n\n   - In Islamic jurisprudence, the presence of urine (or any najis substance) on the body or clothing can affect the validity of prayers. If you were careful and still got urine on your fingers, it's plausible that there could be other, unseen specks elsewhere.\n   - The human eye has its limitations, and tiny specks might not always be visible. Therefore, it's possible for small amounts of urine to be overlooked if they are not easily visible to the naked eye.\n\n2. **Water Splashing Back After Washing**: You mentioned washing your private area at work using tap water and sometimes water splashes back onto you after running off your penis.\n\n   - The question here is whether this splashed-back water is considered najis (impure).\n   - In Islamic jurisprudence, if water that has come into contact with a najis (impure) substance is splashed back, the status of that water (whether it remains tahir/pak or becomes najis) can depend on several factors, including the quantity of water and the presence of visible traces of the impure substance.\n   - Generally, if the water is from a large quantity (such as from a tap), and there's no visible trace of impurity (urine, in this case) in the splashed-back water, it's often considered tahir (pure). The principle here involves the concept of 'water in abundance' or the lack of visible impurity.\n\nTo directly address your questions:\n\n- Yes, it's possible for specks of urine to be overlooked, especially if they are very small or not easily visible.\n- The water that splashes back after washing, assuming it's from a tap and there's no visible urine or impurity in it, is generally considered tahir (pure). However, the cleanliness and purity can depend on the specific circumstances, such as the visibility of impurity and the volume of water.\n\nIt's always a good idea to ensure cleanliness to the best of your ability, and if you're unsure about the purity of something, you can take steps to verify or ensure cleanliness according to your school of thought or Islamic jurisprudence guidelines you're following."}

However, during the training period I cant choose the setting where to practice, I will have to work with female patients. Would this be allowed for the training period only? ? --T--", "Answer": "The nakedness (awra) of a woman in front of a non-Mahram male is all her body except her face, hands and feet, and the nakedness of a male is from below his navel up to and including his knees. (See: the major fiqh references). Hence, it will not be permitted to expose, see or touch the Awra except in the most dire of situations.Medical treatment is considered by the jurists (fuqaha) to be a genuine case of need; hence, they permit a male practitioner to examine and treat the effected area of a womans body, provided certain conditions are met.The renowned Hanafi jurist, Imam al-Haskafi (Allah have mercy on him) states whilst discussing the genuine reasons for the permissibility of a man looking at a womans Awra: And for medical treatment, in that a male doctor may look at (and treat) the effected area (of a womans body) but only to the extent of need, for cases of need are restricted to the actual need And it is preferable that the male doctor teaches and instructs a female to treat her, for looking at (and treating) someone from the same gender is a lesser of an evil. (See: Radd al-Muhtar ala al-Durr al-Mukhtar, 6/371)Imam Ibn Abidin (Allah have mercy on him) explains in his Radd al-Muhtar that, if the treatment is connected to the private parts of a woman, then only in extreme situations will it be permitted for her to be treated by a male doctor. He states: If the treatment is on her private parts, then he should teach and instruct a female to treat her. If this is not possible and it is feared that the woman patient may perish or undergo unbearable pains, only then will it be permissible for a male doctor to treat her, provided her non-effected parts of the body are completely covered and provided he keeps his gaze low as much as possible except from the effected area. (ibid)Based on the above, in principle it would be permitted for you to take up your profession as an electrocardiogram technician or work as a nurses aid. However, in the situation where you will be required to treat and touch the Awra of a woman, especially her genital area, you will need to keep the following in mind:If a female is available to treat the woman patient, it will not be permitted for you to treat her, especially when the treatment is connected to her private parts; rather, you will have to instruct a female to carry out the treatment. You should try and avoid treating the genital and breast areas of a woman. However, if the case is extreme, in that there is no female available to treat or examine her, and it is feared that her condition will worsen; then it will be allowed for you to treat her. In doing so, you must ensure to keep your gaze away from parts of the body that do not require to be examined, and also ensure that those areas of her body are properly covered.

Islamic teachings emphasize modesty and avoiding unnecessary physical contact with members of the opposite sex who are not closely related (mahram).\n   - The necessity of performing an ECG might justify some level of physical contact for diagnostic purposes. However, Islamic scholars generally advise that such procedures should be performed by individuals of the same sex when possible, to maintain modesty and prevent any potential harm or discomfort.\n   - If there are female ECG technicians available, it would be preferable for female patients to be treated by them. If you're the only technician available, or if your role is critical and can't be easily substituted, the situation might be viewed differently, but it's still a matter of balancing necessity with the principles of modesty.\n   - The age of the patients (e.g., if they are elderly) doesn't necessarily change the ruling regarding modesty and interaction with the opposite sex, though some scholars might consider the aspect of attraction or fitnah.\n\n2. **Working as a Nurse's Aid:**\n   - As a Nurse's Aid, you would be required to perform intimate care tasks such as bathing, and cleaning the genital and anal areas of patients. This role involves a high level of physical contact and privacy invasion for the patients.\n   - Similar to the ECG technician role, Islamic principles advise against a male caring for a female in such intimate ways unless absolutely necessary or there's no alternative (e.g., a female caregiver isn't available).\n   - The fact that 99% of your patients are 65 years or older doesn't change the basic ruling regarding gender interaction in Islam. However, some might argue that elderly individuals are less likely to be a source of fitnah (temptation), though this is not universally agreed upon.\n   - Training periods often require exposure to various settings. While it's understandable that you can't choose your patients during training, the intention is to eventually work in a setting that complies with Islamic guidelines if possible (e.g., male-only or female-only care facilities).\n\n**General Guidance:**\n- In both scenarios, it's crucial to explore alternatives that comply with Islamic principles, such as working in male-only or female"}

Narrated Sa`id: While we were at the house of Ibn `Abbas, Ibn `Abbas said, \"Ask me (any question)\" I said, \"O Abu `Abbas! May Allah let me be sacrificed for you ! There is a man at Kufa who is a storyteller called Nauf; who claims that he (Al-Khadirs companion) is not Moses of Bani Israel.\" As for `Amr, he said to me, \"Ibn `Abbas said, \"(Nauf) the enemy of Allah told a lie.\" But Ya`la said to me, \"Ibn `Abbas said, Ubai bin Ka`b said, Allahs Apostle said, Once Moses, Allahs Apostle, preached to the people till their eyes shed tears and their hearts became tender, whereupon he finished his sermon. Then a man came to Moses and asked, O Allahs Apostle! Is there anyone on the earth who is more learned than you? Moses replied, No. So Allah admonished him (Moses), for he did not ascribe all knowledge to Allah. It was said, (on behalf of Allah), Yes, (there is a slave of ours who knows more than you ). Moses said, O my Lord! Where is he? Allah said, At the junction of the two seas. Moses said, O my Lord ! Tell I me of a sign whereby I will recognize the place. \" `Amr said to me, Allah said, \"That place will be where the fish will leave you.\" Ya`la said to me, \"Allah said (to Moses), Take a dead fish (and your goal will be) the place where it will become alive. \" So Moses took a fish and put it in a basket and said to his boy-servant \"I dont want to trouble you, except that you should inform me as soon as this fish leaves you.\" He said (to Moses).\" You have not demanded too much.\" And that is as mentioned by Allah: And (remember) when Moses said to his attendant ....  (18.60) Yusha` bin Noon. (Sa`id did not state that). The Prophet said, \"While the attendant was in the shade of the rock at a wet place, the fish slipped out (alive) while Moses was sleeping. His attend an said (to himself), \"I will not wake him, but when he woke up, he forgot to tell him The fish slipped out and entered the sea. Allah stopped the flow of the sea. where the fish was, so that its trace looked as if it was made on a rock. `Amr forming a hole with his two thumbs an index fingers, said to me, \"Like this, as in its trace was made on a rock.\" Moses said \"We have suffered much fatigue on this journey of ours.\" (This was not narrated by Sa`id). Then they returned back and found Al-Khadir. `Uthman bin Abi Sulaiman said to me, (they found him) on a green carpet in the middle of the sea. Al-Khadir was covered with his garment with one end under his feet and the other end under his head. When Moses greeted, he uncovered his face and said astonishingly, Is there such a greeting in my land? Who are you? Moses said, I am Moses. Al- Khadir said, Are you the Moses of Bani Israel? Moses said, Yes. Al-Khadir said, \"What do you want? Moses said,  I came to you so that you may teach me of the truth which you were taught. Al- Khadir said, Is it not sufficient for you that the Torah is in your hands and the Divine Inspiration comes to you, O Moses? Verily, I have a knowledge that you ought not learn, and you have a knowledge which I ought not learn. At that time a bird took with its beak (some water) from the sea: Al-Khadir then said, By Allah, my knowledge and your knowledge besides Allahs Knowledge is like what this bird has taken with its beak from the sea. Until, when they went on board the boat (18.71). They found a small boat which used to carry the people from this sea-side to the other sea-side. The crew recognized Al-Khadir and said, The pious slave of Allah. (We said to Sa`id \"Was that Khadir?\" He said, \"Yes.\") The boat men said, We will not get him on board with fare. Al-Khadir scuttled the boat and then plugged the hole with a piece o wood. Moses said, Have you scuttle it in order to drown these people surely, you have done a dreadful thing. (18.71) (Mujahid said. \"Moses said so protestingly.\") Al-Khadir said, didnt I say that you can have no patience with me? (18.72) The first inquiry of Moses was done because of forget fullness, the second caused him to be bound with a stipulation, and the third was done he intentionally. Moses said, Call me not to account for what I forgot and be not hard upon me for my affair (with you). (18.73) (Then) they found a boy and Al-Khadir killed him. Ya`la- said: Sa`id said They found boys playing and Al-Khadir got hold of a handsome infidel boy laid him down and then slew him with knife. Moses said, Have you killed a innocent soul who has killed nobody (18.74) Then they proceeded and found a wall which was on the point of falling down, and Al-Khadir set it up straight Sa`id moved his hand thus and said Al-Khadir raised his hand and the wall became straight. Ya`la said, I think Sa`id said, Al-Khadir touched the wall with his hand and it became straight (Moses said to Al-Khadir), If you had wished, you could have taken wages for it. Sa`id said, Wages that we might had eaten. And there was a king in furor (ahead) of them\" (18.79) And there was in front of them. Ibn `Abbas recited: In front of them (was) a king. It is said on the authority of somebody other than Sa`id that the king was Hudad bin Budad. They say that the boy was called Haisur. A king who seized every ship by force. (18.79) So I wished that if that boat passed by him, he would leave it because of its defect and when they have passed they would repair it and get benefit from it. Some people said that they closed that hole with a bottle, and some said with tar. His parents were believers, and he (the boy) was a non-believer and we(Khadir) feared lest he would oppress them by obstinate rebellion and disbelief. (18.80) (i.e. that their love for him would urge them to follow him in his religion, so we (Khadir) desired that their Lord should change him for them for one better in righteousness and near to mercy (18:81). This was in reply to Moses saying: Have you killed an innocent soul.? (18.74). Near to mercy\" means they will be more merciful to him than they were to the former whom Khadir had killed.

If your skin condition is exacerbated or not healed due to performing Wudu in the conventional manner, you might be allowed to perform *tayammum* (dry ablution) instead.\n\n*Tayammum* involves using clean earth or dust to purify oneself when water cannot be used due to a valid reason, such as a health condition that may worsen with water.

They can provide guidance based on your specific condition and the rulings of your preferred Islamic school of thought.\n\n2. **Understanding the Ruling**: In many Islamic schools of thought, there's a principle that \"necessity makes the forbidden permissible.\" If performing Wudu as is traditionally done will cause significant harm or prolong your suffering due to your skin condition, you may be allowed to perform *tayammum*.\n\n3. **Intention Matters**: Your intention (*niyyah*) to perform the ritual for the sake of worship is crucial. Even if you can't perform Wudu as usual, your intention to follow Allah's commands to the best of your ability is what matters.\n\n4. **Temporary Ruling**: This concession is typically considered a temporary measure until the individual is able to perform the usual rituals without harm. If your condition is long-term, ongoing guidance from a scholar or knowledgeable person is valuable.\n\n5. **Hygiene and Health**: While there's a dispensation for *tayammum*, maintaining cleanliness and health is also a priority in Islam. If there's a way to manage your condition that aligns with both medical advice and Islamic rulings, that would be ideal.\n\nIn summary, if your skin condition is a genuine concern that prevents you from performing Wudu without causing harm, exploring the option of *tayammum* with the guidance of a knowledgeable person is a reasonable step. The emphasis in Islam is on the intention and the effort to comply with divine commands to the best of one's ability."}

(Hearing that) the Quraishi men said, Get at this Sabi (i.e. Muslim) ! They got up and beat me nearly to death. Al `Abbas saw me and threw himself over me to protect me. He then faced them and said, Woe to you! You want to kill a man from the tribe of Ghifar, although your trade and your communications are through the territory of Ghifar? They therefore left me. The next morning I returned (to the Mosque) and said the same as I have said on the previous day. They again said, Get at this Sabi! I was treated in the same way as on the previous day, and again Al-Abbas found me and threw himself over me to protect me and told them the same as he had said the day before. So, that was the conversion of Abu Dhar (may Allah be Merciful to him) to Islam.\"<D>Narrated Ibn `Abbas:The first lady to use a girdle was the mother of Ishmael. She used a girdle so that she might hide her tracks from Sarah. Abraham brought her and her son Ishmael while she was suckling him, to a place near the Ka`ba under a tree on the spot of Zamzam, at the highest place in the mosque. During those days there was nobody in Mecca, nor was there any water So he made them sit over there and placed near them a leather bag containing some dates, and a small water-skin containing some water, and set out homeward. Ishmaels mother followed him saying, \"O Abraham! Where are you going, leaving us in this valley where there is no person whose company we may enjoy, nor is there anything (to enjoy)?\" She repeated that to him many times, but he did not look back at her Then she asked him, \"Has Allah ordered you to do so?\" He said, \"Yes.\" She said, \"Then He will not neglect us,\" and returned while Abraham proceeded onwards, and on reaching the Thaniya where they could not see him, he faced the Ka`ba, and raising both hands, invoked Allah saying the following prayers: O our Lord! I have made some of my offspring dwell in a valley without cultivation, by Your Sacred House (Ka`ba at Mecca) in order, O our Lord, that they may offer prayer perfectly. So fill some hearts among men with love towards them, and (O Allah) provide them with fruits, so that they may give thanks. (14.37) Ishmaels mother went on suckling Ishmael and drinking from the water (she had). When the water in the water-skin had all been used up, she became thirsty and her child also became thirsty. She started looking at him (i.e. Ishmael) tossing in agony; She left him, for she could not endure looking at him, and found that the mountain of Safa was the nearest mountain to her on that land. She stood on it and started looking at the valley keenly so that she might see somebody, but she could not see anybody. Then she descended from Safa and when she reached the valley, she tucked up her robe and ran in the valley like a person in distress and trouble, till she crossed the valley and reached the Marwa mountain where she stood and started looking, expecting to see somebody, but she could not see anybody. She repeated that (running between Safa and Marwa) seven times.\" The Prophet said, \"This is the source of the tradition of the walking of people between them (i.e. Safa and Marwa). When she reached the Marwa (for the last time) she heard a voice and she asked herself to be quiet and listened attentively. She heard the voice again and said, O, (whoever you may be)! You have made me hear your voice; have you got something to help me?\" And behold! She saw an angel at the place of Zamzam, digging the earth with his heel (or his wing), till water flowed from that place. She started to make something like a basin around it, using her hand in this way, and started filling her water-skin with water with her hands, and the water was flowing out after she had scooped some of it.\" The Prophet added, \"May Allah bestow Mercy on Ishmaels mother! Had she let the Zamzam (flow without trying to control it) (or had she not scooped from that water) (to fill her water-skin), Zamzam would have been a stream flowing on the surface of the earth.\" The Prophet further added, \"Then she drank (water) and suckled her child. The angel said to her, Dont be afraid of being neglected, for this is the House of Allah which will be built by this boy and his father, and Allah never neglects His people. The House (i.e. Ka`ba) at that time was on a high place resembling a hillock, and when torrents came, they flowed to its right and left. She lived in that way till some people from the tribe of Jurhum or a family from Jurhum passed by her and her child, as they (i.e. the Jurhum people) were coming through the way of Kada. They landed in the lower part of Mecca where they saw a bird that had the habit of flying around water and not leaving it. They said, This bird must be flying around water, though we know that there is no water in this valley. They sent one or two messengers who discovered the source of water, and returned to inform them of the water. So, they all came (towards the water).\" The Prophet added, \"Ishmaels mother was sitting near the water. They asked her, Do you allow us to stay with you?\" She replied, Yes, but you will have no right to possess the water. They agreed to that.\" The Prophet further said, \"Ishmaels mother was pleased with the whole situation as she used to love to enjoy the company of the people. So, they settled there, and later on they sent for their families who came and settled with them so that some families became permanent residents there. The child (i.e. Ishmael) grew up and learnt Arabic from them and (his virtues) caused them to love and admire him as he grew up, and when he reached the age of puberty they made him marry a woman from amongst them. After Ishmaels mother had died, Abraham came after Ishmaels marriage in order to see his family that he had left before, but he did not find Ishmael there. When he asked Ishmaels wife about him, she replied, He has gone in search of our livelihood. Then he asked her about their way of living and their condition, and she replied, We are living in misery; we are living in hardship and destitution, complaining to him. He said, When your husband returns, convey my salutation to him and tell him to change the threshold of the gate (of his house). When Ishmael came, he seemed to have felt something unusual, so he asked his wife, Has anyone visited you? She replied, Yes, an old man of so-and-so description came and asked me about you and I informed him, and he asked about our state of living, and I told him that we were living in a hardship and poverty. On that Ishmael said, Did he advise you anything? She replied, Yes, he told me to convey his salutation to you and to tell you to change the threshold of your gate. Ishmael said, It was my father, and he has ordered me to divorce you. Go back to your family. So, Ishmael divorced her and married another woman from amongst them (i.e. Jurhum). Then Abraham stayed away from them for a period as long as Allah wished and called on them again but did not find Ishmael. So he came to Ishmaels wife and asked her about Ishmael. She said, He has gone in search of our livelihood. Abraham asked her, How are you getting on? asking her about their sustenance and living. She replied, We are prosperous and well-off (i.e. we have everything in abundance). Then she thanked Allah Abraham said, What kind of food do you eat? She said. Meat. He said, What do you drink? She said, Water.\" He said, \"O Allah! Bless their meat and water.\" The Prophet added, \"At that time they did not have grain, and if they had grain, he would have also invoked Allah to bless it.\" The Prophet added, \"If somebody has only these two things as his sustenance, his health and disposition will be badly affected, unless he lives in Mecca.\" The Prophet added,\" Then Abraham said Ishmaels wife, \"When your husband comes, give my regards to him and tell him that he should keep firm the threshold of his gate. When Ishmael came back, he asked his wife, Did anyone call on you? She replied, Yes, a good-looking old man came to me, so she praised him and added. He asked about you, and I informed him, and he asked about our livelihood and I told him that we were in a good condition. Ishmael asked her, Did he give you any piece of advice? She said, Yes, he told me to give his regards to you and ordered that you should keep firm the threshold of your gate. On that Ishmael said, It was my father, and you are the threshold (of the gate). He has ordered me to keep you with me. Then Abraham stayed away from them for a period as long as Allah wished, and called on them afterwards. He saw Ishmael under a tree near Zamzam, sharpening his arrows. When he saw Abraham, he rose up to welcome him (and they greeted each other as a father does with his son or a son does with his father). Abraham said, O Ishmael! Allah has given me an order. Ishmael said, Do what your Lord has ordered you to do. Abraham asked, Will you help me? Ishmael said, I will help you. Abraham said, Allah has ordered me to build a house here, pointing to a hillock higher than the land surrounding it.\" The Prophet added, \"Then they raised the foundations of the House (i.e. the Ka`ba). Ishmael brought the stones and Abraham was building, and when the walls became high, Ishmael brought this stone and put it for Abraham who stood over it and carried on building, while Ishmael was handing him the stones, and both of them were saying, O our Lord! Accept (this service) from us, Verily, You are the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing. The Prophet added, \"Then both of them went on building and going round the Ka`ba saying: O our Lord ! Accept (this service) from us, Verily, You are the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing.\" (2.127)<D>Narrated Qaylah bint Makhramah:Abdullah ibn Hasan al-Anbari said: My grandmothers, Safiyyah and Duhaybah, narrated to me, that hey were the daughters of Ulaybah and were nourished by Qaylah, daughter of Makhramah. She was the grandmother of their father. She reported to them, saying: We came upon the Messenger of Allah (). My companion, Hurayth ibn Hassan, came to him as a delegate from Bakr ibn Wail. He took the oath of allegiance of Islam for himself and for his people. He then said: Messenger of Allah (), write a document for us, giving us the land lying between us and Banu Tamim at ad-Dahna to the effect that not one of them will cross it in our direction except a traveller or a passer-by. He said: Write down ad-Dahna for them, boy. When I saw that he passed orders to give it to him, I became anxious, for it was my native land and my home. I said: Messenger of Allah, he did not ask you for a true border when he asked you. This land of Dahna is a place where the camels have their home, and it is a pasture for the sheep. The women of Banu Tamim and their children are beyond it. He said: Stop, boy! A poor woman spoke the truth: a Muslim is a brother of a Muslim. Each one of them may benefit from water and trees, and they should cooperate with each other against Satan.<D>(That We may give life thereby to a dead land) a land that has no vegetation, (and We give many beasts and men that We have created to drink thereof.<D>(Then turned He to the heaven) then He turned to the creation of the heaven (when it was smoke) steam of water, (and said unto it) unto the heaven (and unto the earth) after He had created both: (Come both of you) give both of you the water and vegetation that you have, (willingly or loth.

(But most of them) all of them (know not) Allahs divine Oneness nor do they give thanks for His blessings.", "Generated_Answer": "Islamic scholars have discussed the permissibility of giving Zamzam water to non-Muslims. The majority view is that it is permissible to give Zamzam water to non-Muslims if they are in need of it, as an act of kindness and charity.\n\nZamzam water is considered a blessing and a mercy from Allah, and its benefits are not limited to Muslims. If a Hindu person is suffering from a medical condition like constant hiccups, and Zamzam water is believed to be beneficial in alleviating their suffering, it would be permissible to give it to them.\n\nHowever, it's essential to consider the following:\n\n*   The intention behind giving Zamzam water should be to help alleviate the person's suffering and show kindness, not to proselytize or impose Islamic beliefs.\n*   One should be respectful of the Hindu person's beliefs and traditions.\n*   It should be ensured that the person is willing to accept the Zamzam water and that it is given with their consent.\n\nIn this context, Islamic principles emphasize compassion, kindness, and the permission to give Zamzam water to those in need, regardless of their faith. If the situation allows for it, explaining the significance of Zamzam water in a respectful manner can foster understanding and goodwill, but this should be done with sensitivity towards the recipient's beliefs."}

Walid b. Samit reported:I and my father set out in search of knowledge to a tribe of the Ansar before their death (i. e. before the Companions of the Holy Prophet left the world) and I was the first to meet Abu Yasar, a Companion of Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) and there was a young man with him who carried the record of letters with him and there was a mantle prepared by the tribe of Maafiri upon him. And his servant too had a Maafiri mantle over him. My father said to him: My uncle, I see the signs of anger or that of agony on your face. He said: Yes, such and such person, the son of so and so, of the tribe of Harami owed me a debt. I went to his family, extended salutations and said: Where is he? They said: He is not here. Then came out to me his son who was at the threshold of his youth. I said to him: Where is your father? He said: No sooner did he hear your sound than he hid himself behind my mothers bedstead. I said to him: Walk out to me, for I know where you are. He came out. I said to him: What prompted you to hide yourself from me? He said: By God, whatever I would say to you would not be a lie. By Allah, I fear that I should tell a lie to you and in case of making promise with you I should break it, as you are the Companion of Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him). The fact is that I was hard up in regard to money. I said: Do you adjure by Allah? He said: I adjure by Allah. I said: Do you adjure by Allah? He said: I adjure by Allah. I said: Do you adjure by Allah? He said: I adjure by Allah. Then he brought his promissory note and he wrote off (the debt) with his hand and said: Make payment when you find yourself solvent enough to pay me back; if you are not, then there is no liability upon you. These two eyes of mine saw, and he (AbuI-Yasar) placed his fingers upon his eyes and these two ears of mine heard and my heart retained, and he pointed towards his heart that Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: He who gives time to one who is financially hard up (in the payment of debt) or writes off his debt, Allah will provide him His shadow. I said to him: My uncle, if you get the cloak of your servant and you give him your two clothes, or take his two clothes of Maafir and give him your cloak, then there would be one dress for you and one for him. He wiped my head and said: O Allah, bless the son of my brother. O, son of my brother, these two very eyes of mine saw and these two ears of mine listened to and this heart of mine retained this, and he pointed towards the heart that Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: Feed them (the servants) and clothe them (the servants) what you wear, and if I give him the goods of the world, it is easy for me than this that he should take my virtues on the Day of Resurrection. We went on till we came to Jabir b. Abdullah in the mosque and he was busy in observing prayer in one cloth which he had joined at its opposite ends. I made my way through the people till I sat between him and the Qibla and I said: May Allah have mercy upon you. Do you observe prayer with one cloth on your body whereas your mantle is lying at your side? He pointed me with his hand towards my breast just like this and he separated his fingers and bent them in the shape of a bow. And (he said): I thought that a fool like you should come to me so that he should see me as I do and he should then also do like it. Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) came to us in this very mosque and he had in his hand the twig of the palm-tree and he saw mucus towards the Qibla of the mosque and he erased it with the help of the twig. He then came to us and said: Who amongst you likes that Allah should turn His face away from him? We were afraid. He then again said: Who amongst you likes that Allah should turn His face away from him? We were afraid. He again said: Who amongst you likes that Allah should turn His face away from him? We said: Allahs Messenger, none of us likes it. And he said: If one amongst you stands for prayer, Allah, the Exalted and Glorious, is before him he should not spit in front of him, or on his right side, but should spit on his left side beneath his left foot and if he is impelled to do so all of a sudden (in spite of himself) he should then spit in his cloth and fold it in some part of it. (and he further said: ) Bring some sweet-smelling thing. A young man who belonged to our tribe stood up, went and brought scent in his palm. Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) took that and applied it to the end of that twig and then touched the place where there had been mucus. Jabir said: This is why you should apply scent to your mosques. It is reported on the same authority: We set out along with Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) on an expedition of Batn Buwat. He (the Holy Prophet) was in search of al-Majdi b. Amr al-Juhani. (We had so meagre equipment) that five. six or seven of us had one camel to ride and so we mounted it turn by turn. Once there wan. the turn of an Ansari to ride upon the camel. He made it kneel down to ride over it (and after having. mounted it), he tried to raise it up but it hesitated. So he said. May there be curse of Allah upon you! Thereupon Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: Who is there to curse his camel? He said: Allahs Messenger, it is I. Thereupon he said: Get down from the camel and let us not have in our company the cursed one. Dont curse your own selves, nor your children. nor your belongings. There is the possibility that your curse may synchronies with the time when Allah is about to confer upon you what you demand and thus your prayer may be readily responded. It is reported on the same authority: We set out on an expedition along with Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) until it was evening, and we had been near a. water reservoir of Arabia. Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: Who would be the person who would go ahead and set right the reservoir and drink water himself and serve us with it? Jabir said: I stood up and said: Allahs Messenger, it is I who am ready to do that. Thereupon Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: Who is the person to accompany Jabir? And then Jabbar b. Sakhr stood up. So we went to that well and poured in that tank a bucket or two of water and plastered it with clay and then began to fill it (with water) until it was filled to the brim. Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) was the first who appeared before us, and he said: Do you (both) permit me to drink water out of it? We said: Yea, Allahs Messenger. He led his camel to drink water and it drank. He then pulled its rein and it stretched its legs and began to urinate. He then took it aside and made it kneel down at another place and then came to the tank and performed ablution. I then got up and performed ablution like the ablution of Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him), and Jabbar b. Sakhr went in order to relieve himself and Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) got up to observe prayer and there was a mantle over me. I tried to invert its ends but it was too short (to cover my body easily). It had its borders. I then inverted it (the mantle) and drew its opposite ends and then tied them at my neck. I then came and stood upon the left side of Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him). He caught hold of me and made me go round behind him, until he made me stand on his right side. Then Jabbar b. Sakhr came. He performed ablution and then came and stood on the left side of Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him). Then Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) caught hold of our hands together, pushed us back and made us stand behind him. Then Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) began to look upon me with darting looks, but I did not perceive that. After that I became aware of it and he pointed with the gesture of his hand that I should wrap my loin-cloth. When Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) had finished the prayer, he said: Jabir! I said: Allahs Messenger, at thy beck and call. He said: When the cloth around you is inadequate, then tie the opposite ends but when it is small, tie it over the lower body. Jabir reported: We set out on an expedition with Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) and the only means of sustenance for every person amongst us was only one date for a day and we used to chew it. And we struck the leaves with the help of our bow and ate them until the sides of our mouths were injured. It so happened one day that a person was overlooked and not given a date. We carried that person and bore witness to the fact that he had not been given that date so he was offered that and he got up and received that. Jabir reported: We set out on an expedition along with Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) until we got down at a spacious valley and Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) went to relieve himself. I followed him with a bucket full of water and Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) looked about and he found no privacy but two trees at the end of the valley and Allahs Messenger (may. peace be upon him) went to one of them and took hold of one of its twigs and said: Be thou under my control by the permission of Allah, and so it came under his control like the camel who has its nosestring in the hand of its rider, and then he came to the second tree and took hold of a twig and said: Be thou under my control with the permission of Allah, and it came under his control, and when he came in the middle of the two trees he joined together the two twigs and said: join with the permission of Allah. Jabir said: I was afraid lest Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) should be aware of my nearness and go still farther. And Muhammad b. Abbad has used the word\" faitabd\" and I began to talk to myself. And as I saw, I suddenly found Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) before me and the two trees were separated and each one of them was standing at its place. I saw Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) standing for a short time, nodding his head towards right and left. Ismail pointed towards the right and left with the help of his head (in order to demonstrate how the Holy Prophet had pointed). Then he (the Holy Prophet) came to me and said: Jabir did you see my place where I was standing? I said: Allahs Messenger, yes. He then said: Then you should go to those two trees and cut a twig from each of them and go to that place with them where I was standing and stand there where I was standing and place a twig on the right and a twig on the left. Jabir said: I set out and took hold of a stone and broke it and sharpened it and then I came to those trees and cut a twig from each one of them. I then came dragging them until I stood at the place where Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) had been standing and placed a twig on the right and a twig on the left. Then I met him and said: Allahs Messenger, I have done that, but (kindly) explain to me the reason for it. Thereupon he said: I passed by two graves the occupants of which had been undergoing torment. I liked to make intercession for them so that the might be relieved of this torment y as long as these twigs remain fresh. Jabir said: We came back to the (camp of the) army and Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: Jabir, call people for per- forming wudu. I cried: Come and perform wudu, come and perform wudu, come and perform wudu. I said: Allahs Messenger, there is not even a drop of water in the army camp, and there. was a person who used to cool the water for Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) in the old water-skin which kept hanging by the twig. He asked me to go to such and such Ansari and ask him to see if there was any water in that skin. I went to him and cast a glance in it but did not find anything but a drop in the mouth of that water-skin and if I were to draw that, the water-skins,. dried part would suck it up. I came to Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) and said: Allahs Messenger, I have not found anything in it but a drop of water in the mouth of the water-skin and now if I were to draw that, it would be absorbed. He said: Go and bring that to me. I brought that to him. He took hold of it -and began to utter something which I could not understand and then pressed it with his hand and gave that to me and said: Jabir, announce for the tub to be brought. So I announced that the tub of the army (be brought). It was brought accordingly and I placed it before him (the Holy Prophet). Thereupon Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) placed his hands in the tub like this: with his fingers stretched out, and then he placed his fingers at the bottom of the tub and said: Jabir, take it (that waters-skin) and pour water over me, by reciting Bismillah, and I poured water and I said: Bismillah, and found water sprouting out between the fingers of Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him). Then that tub gushed forth until it was filled up and the Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: Jabir, make an announcement to the effect: He who needs water should take that. Jabir said: The people came and got water until they were all satiated. I said: Is there anyone left who wants to get it? And Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) then lifted up his hand from that tub and it was still full. Then the people made a complaint to Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) about hunger and he said: May Allah provide you food! We came to the bank of the ocean and the ocean was tossing and it threw out a big animal and we lit fire and cooked it and took it until we had eaten to our hearts content. Jabir said: I and such and such five persons entered Its socket and nobody could see us until we had come out, and we took hold of one of its ribs and twisted it into a sort of arch, then we called the tallest of the persons of the army and the hugest of the camels of the army and it had the big saddle over it, and it could easily pass through it without the rider having need to bend down.<D>(They said: In Allah we put trust.

Let's address the concerns step by step.\n\n1. **Purification after Urination**: It's understood that you're taking steps to ensure you're clean after using the restroom, which is commendable. The process of using toilet paper until you're sure you've cleaned yourself properly is a common practice. However, the concern about the toilet paper moving out of place and potentially soiling your underwear is a valid one in terms of maintaining purity.\n\n2. **Impurity and Underwear**: In Islamic jurisprudence, if your underwear comes into contact with impurity (najasah), it is considered impure. However, the ruling on whether it needs to be washed depends on the specific circumstances and the school of thought you're following. Generally, if the impurity is minor and you're unable to avoid it, the ruling might be more lenient.\n\n3. **Waswasah (Obsessive Doubt)**: It's possible that your concerns could be exacerbated by waswasah, which involves excessive doubt or anxiety about one's state of purity or other aspects of religious practice. Ignoring such doubts or learning to manage them is often advised, as acting on every doubt can lead to unnecessary hardship.\n\n4. **Leading Prayer**: If you have led prayers while potentially in a state of impurity or with clothing that is not clean, it's a serious concern. In Islam, the validity of prayer is contingent upon certain conditions, including the purity of the individual leading the prayer and their clothing.\n\n### Addressing Your Concerns\n\n- **For Future Practice**: To minimize issues, ensure you're using adequate methods for cleaning and consider using more secure or absorbent materials to prevent leakage. If you're concerned about waswasah, it might be helpful to consult with a scholar or a mental health professional who understands the concept.\n\n- **Validity of Previous Prayers**: If you've led prayers and there's a genuine doubt about your state of purity, it's a complex issue that may require consultation with a knowledgeable Islamic scholar. They can provide guidance based on your specific circumstances and the relevant Islamic jurisprudence.\n\n- **Making Up for Prayers**: Generally, if you've led prayers and later found out that there was an issue with your purity, the prayers of the followers are considered valid if they were unaware of the issue. However, if the issue is related to a fundamental aspect of the prayer or purity that directly affects the validity of the prayer, you might need to consult a scholar for specific guidance.\n\n- **Seeking Scholarly Advice**: Given the"}

Please help me. Thanks I am very sad. ? --T--", "Answer": "Dont pay attention towards this. A Mumin, in whichever condition he may be, should turn to Allah Taala ( ).

When I looked and found a snake there, I got up. Abu Sa’ld said:what is with you? I said : Here is a snake. He said : what do you want ? I said : I shall kill it. He then pointed to a room in his house in front of his room and said : My cousin (son of my uncle) was in this room. He asked his permission to go to his wife on the occasion of the battle of Troops (Ahzab), as he was recently married. The Messenger of Allah (May peace be upon him) gave him permission and ordered him to take his weapon with him. He came to his house and found his wife standing at the door of the house. When he pointed to her with the lance, she said; do not make haste till you see what has brought me out. He entered the house and found an ugly snake there. He pierced in the lance while it was quivering. He said : I do not know which of them died first, the man or the snake. His people then came to the Messenger of Allah (May peace be upon him) and said: supplicate Allah to restore our companion to life for us. He said : Ask forgiveness for your Companion. Then he said : In Medina a group of Jinn have embraced Islam, so when you see one of them, pronounce a waring to it three times and if it appears to you after that, kill it after three days.<D>Narrated Sahl bin Sa`d:A woman presented herself to the Prophet (for marriage). A man said to him, \"O Allahs Apostle! (If you are not in need of her) marry her to me.\" The Prophet said, \"What have you got?\" The man said, \"I have nothing.\" The Prophet said (to him), \"Go and search for something) even if it were an iron ring.\" The man went and returned saying, \"No, I have not found anything, not even an iron ring; but this is my (Izar) waist sheet, and half of it is for her.\" He had no Rida (upper garment). The Prophet said, \"What will she do with your waist sheet? If you wear it, she will have nothing over her; and if she wears it, you will have nothing over you.\" So the man sat down and when he had sat a long time, he got up (to leave). When the Prophet saw him (leaving), he called him back, or the man was called (for him), and he said to the man, \"How much of the Quran do you know (by heart)?\" The man replied I know such Sura and such Sura (by heart),\" naming the Suras The Prophet said, \"I have married her to you for what you know of the Quran .\"<D>Narrated Abu Huraira:Allahs Apostle said, \"Horses may be used for three purposes: For a man they may be a source of reward (in the Hereafter); for another, a means of protection; and for another, a source of sin. The man for whom they are a source of reward, is the one who keeps them for Allahs Cause and ties them with long ropes and lets them graze in a pasture or garden. Whatever those long ropes allow them to eat of that pasture or garden, will be written as good deeds for him and if they break their ropes and run one or two rounds, then all their footsteps and dung will be written as good deeds for him, and if they pass a river and drink from it though he has had no intention of watering them, even then, that will be written as good deeds for him. So such horses are a source of reward for that man. For the man who keeps horses for his livelihood in order not to ask others for help or beg his bread, and at the same time he does not forget Allahs right of what he earns through them and of their backs (that he presents it to be used in Allahs Cause), such horses are a shelter for him (from poverty). For the man who keeps them just out of pride and for showing off, they are a source of sin.\" Then Allahs Apostle was asked about donkeys. He said, \"Allah has not revealed anything to me regarding them except this comprehensive Verse: \"Then anyone who has done good, equal to the weight of an atom (or a small ant) shall see it, and any one who has done evil, equal to the weight of an atom (or a small ant) shall see it.\" (99.7-8)<D>(So Allah seized him) Allah punished him ((and made him) an example for the after (life) and for the former) the punishment that he suffered in the life of the world is drowning and the punishment of the Hereafter will be in the Fire; it is also said that this means: Allah has punished him because of his former and latter pronouncements.

You're wondering if there's a connection between your past actions and your current difficulties, including being jobless for 5 years, not being able to get engaged, and health issues with your ear.\n\nFirstly, it's essential to understand that in many belief systems, including Islam, the act of reciting or writing Quranic verses is considered a sacred act and is generally seen as positive, provided it's done with the right intention and respect. However, the issue here seems to be about doing it \"without permission,\" which might imply that you felt you weren't supposed to or weren't sure if you should.\n\nTo address your concerns:\n\n1. **Intention Matters**: In Islamic teachings, the intention behind an action is crucial. If your intention was not to disrespect or misuse the Surah, then that is an important factor.\n\n2. **Seeking Forgiveness**: If you feel that your actions were not in line with what is considered appropriate or respectful, you can seek forgiveness. In Islam, seeking forgiveness (Istighfar) is a powerful means of rectifying past mistakes. You can pray for forgiveness and do good deeds to counterbalance any negative effects you believe your actions may have caused.\n\n3. **Dispose of the Written Surah Respectfully**: If you're concerned about the physical papers with the Surah written on them, the respectful way to dispose of them would be to either burn them in a clean and safe manner or bury them in a clean place. This is to prevent the writings from being mishandled or thrown about carelessly.\n\n4. **Pray and Seek Guidance**: You can pray for guidance and relief from your current difficulties. In Islam, the prayer for guidance is known as \"Salat al-Istikhara,\" and you can also make Dua (supplication) to Allah for help with your joblessness, health issues, and personal life.\n\n5. **Take Practical Steps**: While seeking spiritual relief, it's also crucial to take practical steps towards resolving your issues. This could mean looking for a job actively, seeking medical advice for your ear problems from professionals, and engaging in social activities to meet new people.\n\n6. **Consult a Scholar or Imam**: If you're still unsure about the implications of your actions or the appropriate steps to take, consider consulting with a"}

He said He should not wear shirts, turbans, trousers, garments with head coverings and clothing which has any dye of waras or saffron; one should not put on shoes unless one cannot get sandals. If one cannot get sandals, one should wear the shoes, in which case one must cut them to come below the ankles.<D>Narrated Abd Allaah b.

He said: Messenger of Allah, would that you purchased it and wore it on Friday and when a delegation came to you. The Messenger of Allah () said: Only he who has no portion in the next world wears this (silk).

Umar said: Messenger of Allah, you are clothing me with it, but you said about the robe of Utarid what you said. The Messenger of Allah () said: I did not give it to you so that you may wear it.

The condition that there should be no traces left of the impurity is crucial. If, after immersion, there is no visible or tangible sign of the najasah (impurity), such as its color, smell, or taste, on the clothing, then it is considered pure.\n\nThis ruling is based on the Islamic jurisprudence principle that water is a primary means of purification. The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) and subsequent Islamic jurisprudence have established that water can purify objects that have come into contact with najasah, provided certain conditions are met.\n\nThe size of the body of water is also a consideration in some schools of thought. A large body of water, often referred to as \"ma'-e-kathir\" or \"ma'-e-mutlaq,\" is generally considered to retain its purifying properties unless the impurity alters its characteristics (i.e., its color, smell, or taste). Immersion in such water is considered effective for removing impurities from clothing, assuming no traces of the impurity remain afterward.\n\nIt's always recommended to consult with a knowledgeable Islamic scholar or a mufti for specific guidance on such matters, as the application of these principles can vary based on different Islamic schools of thought and the specific circumstances of the situation."}
{"Question": "Q: Sometimes I am in situations where I am falsely accused or even penalised but in reality, I have not done anything wrong or committed any mistake or error? Is there any advice to help in these situations? ? --T--", "Answer": "If you are able to clarify the issue and in a respectful manner explain your side of the issue, then you should do so. And Allah Taala ( ) knows best", "Document": "Narrated Aisha:(the wife of the Prophet) \"Whenever Allahs Apostle intended to go on a journey, he would draw lots amongst his wives and would take with him the one upon whom the lot fell. During a Ghazwa of his, he drew lots amongst us and the lot fell upon me, and I proceeded with him after Allah had decreed the use of the veil by women. I was carried in a Howdah (on the camel) and dismounted while still in it. When Allahs Apostle was through with his Ghazwa and returned home, and we approached the city of Medina, Allahs Apostle ordered us to proceed at night. When the order of setting off was given, I walked till I was past the army to answer the call of nature. After finishing I returned (to the camp) to depart (with the others) and suddenly realized that my necklace over my chest was missing. So, I returned to look for it and was delayed because of that. The people who used to carry me on the camel, came to my Howdah and put it on the back of the camel, thinking that I was in it, as, at that time, women were light in weight, and thin and lean, and did not use to eat much. So, those people did not feel the difference in the heaviness of the Howdah while lifting it, and they put it over the camel. At that time I was a young lady. They set the camel moving and proceeded on. I found my necklace after the army had gone, and came to their camp to find nobody. So, I went to the place where I used to stay, thinking that they would discover my absence and come back in my search. While in that state, I felt sleepy and slept. Safwan bin Muattal As-Sulami Adh-Dhakwani was behind the army and reached my abode in the morning. When he saw a sleeping person, he came to me, and he used to see me before veiling. So, I got up when I heard him saying, \"Inna lil-lah-wa inn a ilaihi rajiun (We are for Allah, and we will return to Him).\" He made his camel knell down. He got down from his camel, and put his leg on the front legs of the camel and then I rode and sat over it. Safwan set out walking, leading the camel by the rope till we reached the army who had halted to take rest at midday. Then whoever was meant for destruction, fell into destruction, (some people accused me falsely) and the leader of the false accusers was `Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul. After that we returned to Medina, and I became ill for one month while the people were spreading the forged statements of the false accusers. I was feeling during my ailment as if I were not receiving the usual kindness from the Prophet which I used to receive from him when I got sick. But he would come, greet and say, How is that (girl)? I did not know anything of what was going on till I recovered from my ailment and went out with Um Mistah to the Manasi where we used to answer the call of nature, and we used not to go to answer the call of nature except from night to night and that was before we had lavatories near to our houses. And this habit of ours was similar to the habit of the old Arabs in the open country (or away from houses). So. I and Um Mistah bint Ruhm went out walking. Um Mistah stumbled because of her long dress and on that she said, Let Mistah be ruined. I said, You are saying a bad word. Why are you abusing a man who took part in (the battle of) Badr? She said, O Hanata (you there) didnt you hear what they said? Then she told me the rumors of the false accusers. My sickness was aggravated, and when I returned home, Allahs Apostle came to me, and after greeting he said, How is that (girl)? I requested him to allow me to go to my parents. I wanted then to be sure of the news through them I Allahs Apostle allowed me, and I went to my parents and asked my mother, What are the people talking about? She said, O my daughter! Dont worry much about this matter. By Allah, never is there a charming woman loved by her husband who has other wives, but the women would forge false news about her. I said, Glorified be Allah! Are the people really taking of this matter? That night I kept on weeping and could not sleep till morning. In the morning Allahs Apostle called `Ali bin Abu Talib and Usama bin Zaid when he saw the Divine Inspiration delayed, to consul them about divorcing his wife (i.e. `Aisha). Usama bin Zaid said what he knew of the good reputation of his wives and added, O Allahs Apostle! Keep you wife, for, by Allah, we know nothing about her but good. `Ali bin Abu Talib said, O Allahs Apostle! Allah has no imposed restrictions on you, and there are many women other than she, yet you may ask the woman-servant who will tell you the truth. On that Allahs Apostle called Buraira and said, O Burair. Did you ever see anything which roused your suspicions about her? Buraira said, No, by Allah Who has sent you with the Truth, I have never seen in her anything faulty except that she is a girl of immature age, who sometimes sleeps and leaves the dough for the goats to eat. On that day Allahs Apostle ascended the pulpit and requested that somebody support him in punishing `Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul. Allahs Apostle said, Who will support me to punish that person (`Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul) who has hurt me by slandering the reputation of my family? By Allah, I know nothing about my family but good, and they have accused a person about whom I know nothing except good, and he never entered my house except in my company. Sa`d bin Mu`adh got up and said, O Allahs Apostle! by Allah, I will relieve you from him. If that man is from the tribe of the Aus, then we will chop his head off, and if he is from our brothers, the Khazraj, then order us, and we will fulfill your order. On that Sa`d bin Ubada, the chief of the Khazraj and before this incident, he had been a pious man, got up, motivated by his zeal for his tribe and said, By Allah, you have told a lie; you cannot kill him, and you will never be able to kill him. On that Usaid bin Al-Hadir got up and said (to Sa`d bin Ubada), By Allah! you are a liar. By Allah, we will kill him; and you are a hypocrite, defending the hypocrites. On this the two tribes of Aus and Khazraj got excited and were about to fight each other, while Allahs Apostle was standing on the pulpit. He got down and quieted them till they became silent and he kept quiet. On that day I kept on weeping so much so that neither did my tears stop, nor could I sleep. In the morning my parents were with me and I had wept for two nights and a day, till I thought my liver would burst from weeping. While they were sitting with me and I was weeping, an Ansari woman asked my permission to enter, and I allowed her to come in. She sat down and started weeping with me. While we were in this state, Allahs Apostle came and sat down and he had never sat with me since the day they forged the accusation. No revelation regarding my case came to him for a month. He recited Tashah-hud (i.e. None has the right to be worshipped but Allah and Muhammad is His Apostle) and then said, O `Aisha! I have been informed such-and-such about you; if you are innocent, then Allah will soon reveal your innocence, and if you have committed a sin, then repent to Allah and ask Him to forgive you, for when a person confesses his sin and asks Allah for forgiveness, Allah accepts his repentance. When Allahs Apostle finished his speech my tears ceased completely and there remained not even a single drop of it. I requested my father to reply to Allahs Apostle on my behalf. My father said, By Allah, I do not know what to say to Allahs Apostle. I said to my mother, Talk to Allahs Apostle on my behalf. She said, By Allah, I do not know what to say to Allahs Apostle. I was a young girl and did not have much knowledge of the Quran. I said. I know, by Allah, that you have listened to what people are saying and that has been planted in your minds and you have taken it as a truth. Now, if I told you that I am innocent and Allah knows that I am innocent, you would not believe me and if I confessed to you falsely that I am guilty, and Allah knows that I am innocent you would believe me. By Allah, I dont compare my situation with you except to the situation of Josephs father (i.e. Jacob) who said, So (for me) patience is most fitting against that which you assert and it is Allah (Alone) whose help can be sought. Then I turned to the other side of my bed hoping that Allah would prove my innocence. By Allah I never thought that Allah would reveal Divine Inspiration in my case, as I considered myself too inferior to be talked of in the Holy Quran. I had hoped that Allahs Apostle might have a dream in which Allah would prove my innocence. By Allah, Allahs Apostle had not got up and nobody had left the house before the Divine Inspiration came to Allahs Apostle. So, there overtook him the same state which used to overtake him, (when he used to have, on being inspired divinely). He was sweating so much so that the drops of the sweat were dropping like pearls though it was a (cold) wintry day. When that state of Allahs Apostle was over, he was smiling and the first word he said, `Aisha! Thank Allah, for Allah has declared your innocence. My mother told me to go to Allahs Apostle . I replied, By Allah I will not go to him and will not thank but Allah. So Allah revealed: \"Verily! They who spread the slander are a gang among you . . .\" (24.11) When Allah gave the declaration of my Innocence, Abu Bakr, who used to provide for Mistah bin Uthatha for he was his relative, said, By Allah, I will never provide Mistah with anything because of what he said about Aisha. But Allah later revealed: -- \"And let not those who are good and wealthy among you swear not to help their kinsmen, those in need and those who left their homes in Allahs Cause. Let them forgive and overlook. Do you not wish that Allah should forgive you? Verily! Allah is Oft-forgiving, Most Merciful.\" (24.22) After that Abu Bakr said, Yes ! By Allah! I like that Allah should forgive me, and resumed helping Mistah whom he used to help before. Allahs Apostle also asked Zainab bint Jahsh (i.e. the Prophets wife about me saying, What do you know and what did you see? She replied, O Allahs Apostle! I refrain to claim hearing or seeing what I have not heard or seen. By Allah, I know nothing except goodness about Aisha.\" Aisha further added \"Zainab was competing with me (in her beauty and the Prophets love), yet Allah protected her (from being malicious), for she had piety.\"<D>Narrated Aishah:\"What was said about me had been said, and I myself was unaware of it, the Messenger of Allah () got up and addressed the people. He recited the Tashahhud and after praising and expressing gratitude to Allah, as He deserved, he said: To proceed: O people! Give me your opinion regarding those people who made a forged story against my wife. By Allah, I do not know anything bad about her at all. By Allah, they accused her of being with a man about whom I have never known anything bad, and he never entered my house unless I was present there, and whenever I went on a journey, he went with me. Sad bin Muadh [may Allah be pleased with him] got up and said: O Messenger of Allah ()! Allow me to chop their heads off! Then a man from Al-Khazraj, to whom the mother of Hassan bin Thabit was a relative, got up and said (to Sad): You have told a lie! By Allah, if those persons were from Al-Aws, you would not like to chop their heads. It was probable that some evil would take place between Aws and Khazraj in the Masjid while I was unaware of that. In the evening of that day, I went out for some of my needs, and Umm Mistah was accompanying me. On our return, Umm Mistah stumbled and said: Let Mistah be ruined! I said to her, O mother! Why do you abuse your son? On that Umm Mistah became silent for a while, and stumbling again, she said: Let Mistah be ruined! I said to her: O mother! Why do you abuse your son? She stumbled for the third time and said: Let Mistah be ruined! I said to her: O mother! Why do you abuse your son? Upon that she said: By Allah! I do not abuse him except because of you. I asked her: Concerning what of my affairs? So she disclosed the whole story to me. I said: Has this really happened? She replied: Yes, by Allah! I returned to my house, so astonished, that I did not know for what purpose I had gone out. Then I became sick and said to the Messenger of Allah () Send me to my fathers house. So he sent a servant with me, and when I entered the house, I found Umm Ruman downstairs, while Abu Bakr was reciting something upstairs. My mother asked: What has brought you, O daughter? She said: \"I informed her and mentioned the whole story to her, but she did not feel as I did about it. She said: O my daughter! Do not worry much about this matter, for there is never a charming lady loved by her husband who has other wives, but that they feel jealous of her and speak badly of her. But she did not feel the same about it as I did. I asked her: Does my father know about it? She said Yes. I asked: Does the Messenger of Allah () know about it too? She said Yes, the Messenger of Allah () also knows about it. Tears filled my eyes and I wept. Abu Bakr, who was reading upstairs, heard my voice, and came down asking my mother: What is the matter with her? She said: She has heard what has been said about her. On that Abu Bakr wept and said: I beseech you, by Allah, O my daughter, to go back to your home. I went back to my home, and the Messenger of Allah () had come to my house asking my maid-servant about me. The maid-servant said: By Allah! I do not know of any fault or defect in her character except that she sleeps and lets the sheep enter and eat her dough. On that, some of the Prophets Companions spoke harshly to her and said: Tell the truth to the Messenger of Allah (). Finally, they told her of the slander and she said: Subhan Allah! By Allah, I know nothing against her except what a goldsmith knows about a piece of pure gold. Then this news reached the man who was accused, and he said: Subhan Allah! By Allah, I have never uncovered the private parts of any woman. Later, that man was martyred in Allahs Cause. Then the next morning, my parents came to pay me a visit and they stayed with me until the Messenger of Allah () came to me, after he performed the Asr prayer. He came to me and while my parents were sitting around me on my right and my left. The Prophet () said the Tashahhud, praised and glorified Allah and said: Now then, O Aishah! If you have committed a bad deed, or you have wronged (yourself), then repent to Allah, as Allah accepts the repentance from His worshipers. An Ansari woman had come and was sitting near the gate. I said to the Prophet (): Isnt it improper that you speak in such a way in the presence of this lady? The Messenger of Allah () then gave a piece of advice and I turned to my father and requested him to reply to him. My father said: What should I say? Then I turned to my mother and asked her to answer him. She said: What should I say? When my parents did not reply to the Prophet (), I said the Tashahhud, praised and glorified Allah as His due, and I said: Then, by Allah! If I were to tell you that I have not done (this) and Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, is witness that I am telling the truth, that would not be of any use to me on your part, because you (people) have spoken about it and your hearts have absorbed it (as truth); and if I were to tell you that I have done this sin, and Allah knows that I have not done it, then you will say: She has confessed her guilt. By Allah! I do not see a suitable example for me and you except the example of - and I could not remember Yaqbus name - Yusufs father when he said: So patience is most fitting. And it is Allah Whose help can be sought against that which you describe (12:18). She said: \"It was at that time that Revelation came to the Messenger of Allah (), and we remained silent. Then the Revelation was over, and I noticed the signs of happiness on his face while he was wiping (the sweat) from his forehead, and saying: Have the good tidings O Aishah! Allah has revealed your innocence. At that time I was extremely angry. My parents said to me: Get up and go to him. I said: By Allah, I will not do it,and will not thank him nor either of you, but I will thank Allah, Who has revealed my innocence. You have heard (this story) but neither of you have denied it, nor have you changed it (to defend me).\" Aishah used to say: \"But as regards to Zainab bint Jahsh, Allah protected her because of her piety. She did not say anything except good (about me). But her sister, Hamnah was ruined among those who were ruined. Those who used to speak evil about me were Mistah, Hassan bin Thabit, and the hypocrite Abdullah bin Ubayy [bin Salul] and [it is he who] used to spread that news and tempt others to speak of it, and it was he and Hamnah who had the greater share therein. Abu Bakr took an oath that he would never do any favor for Mistah at all. Then Allah, Most High, revealed this Ayah: Let not those among you who are blessed with graces and wealth [until the end of the Ayah] referring to Abu Bakr: to give their kinsmen, the poor, and those who left their homes for Allahs Cause. - meaning Mistah - up to His saying: Do you not love that Allah should forgive you? And Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful (24:22). On that, Abu Bakr said: Yes, by Allah! O our Lord! We wish that You forgive us. So he returned to what he had been doing.\"<D>Abu Dharr reported:I went out one night (and found) the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) walking all alone. There was no man with him. I thought that he did not like anyone walking along with him. So I began to walk in the light of the moon. He, however turned his attention to me and saw me and said: Who is this? I said: It is Abu Dharr. Let Allah make me as ransom for you. He said: Abu Dharr, come on.

Here are some advice that may help you navigate such situations:\n\n1. **Stay calm and composed**: It's natural to feel upset or defensive, but try to maintain your calm and composure. This will help you think more clearly and respond more effectively.\n2. **Understand the context**: Try to understand the reasons behind the false accusation or penalty. Is it a miscommunication, a misunderstanding, or a deliberate act? Knowing the context can help you respond appropriately.\n3. **Gather facts and evidence**: Collect any relevant facts, data, or evidence that can help prove your innocence. This could include documents, emails, witness statements, or other records.\n4. **Communicate effectively**: If possible, communicate with the person or authority making the accusation. Clarify the situation, provide your evidence, and explain your side of the story. Be respectful, professional, and open to feedback.\n5. **Seek support**: Talk to someone you trust, such as a friend, family member, or mentor. They can offer emotional support, provide a fresh perspective, or help you brainstorm a response.\n6. **Know your rights**: Familiarize yourself with the rules, regulations, or policies relevant to the situation. Understand your rights and the procedures for appealing or disputing the accusation.\n7. **Focus on the issue, not the person**: Avoid taking the accusation personally and try to separate the issue from your self-worth. Address the problem at hand, rather than attacking or defending yourself against the person making the accusation.\n8. **Learn from the experience**: After the situation has been resolved, take time to reflect on what happened. Identify any lessons or areas for improvement, and use this experience to grow and develop.\n9. **Consider escalating the issue**: If the false accusation or penalty is severe or has significant consequences, consider escalating the issue to a higher authority or seeking support from a relevant organization or expert.\n10. **Practice self-care**: Being falsely accused or penalized can be stressful and emotionally draining. Make sure to take care of your physical and mental well-being during this time.\n\nRemember, being falsely accused or penalized is not a reflection of your worth or character. By staying calm, gathering evidence, and communicating effectively, you can often resolve the situation and clear your name.\n\n--T--, I hope these tips are helpful in navigating such difficult situations."}

The question of whether someone who commits suicide enters Jannah is complex and sensitive.\n\nIslamic teachings emphasize the mercy and justice of Allah. The Quran and Hadiths provide guidance on this matter.\n\nAccording to Islamic scholars, committing suicide is considered a major sin. The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) is reported to have said, \"Whoever kills himself with something in this world, will be punished with it on the Day of Resurrection.\" (Bukhari)\n\nHowever, the ultimate judgment of a person who commits suicide is left to Allah. It's believed that Allah's mercy is vast, and He may forgive anyone, including those who commit suicide, if they sincerely repent before their death.\n\nSome Islamic scholars argue that if a person commits suicide due to unbearable suffering, illness, or other difficult circumstances, their actions might be seen as a result of their circumstances rather than a deliberate rejection of Allah's will. In such cases, their fate is considered to be with Allah, who is the Most Merciful and Just.\n\nIt's essential to note that Islamic teachings encourage compassion and understanding towards those who struggle with mental health or difficult situations. The community is urged to provide support and help to those in need.\n\nIn summary, while committing suicide is considered a grave sin in Islam, the ultimate judgment is with Allah. Muslims are encouraged to pray for the deceased and for those affected by the loss, and to seek help and support for those struggling with difficult emotions or circumstances.\n\nIf you or someone you know is struggling, there are resources available, such as the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline (1-800-273-TALK) or local support groups."}
{"Question": "Q: I wanted to know the ruling of women growing their hair. Is keeping long hair more part of culture then religion? What is the ruling of cutting the hair? Is it permissible to keep short hair as there is a hadith which mentions that Aisha (Radiyallahu Anaha) had short hair. ? --T--", "Answer": "In matters of Deen we are commanded to follow the Fuqaha. The Fuqaha are those experts in Deen who after carrying out an extensive and comprehensive study of the Quraan, the Mubarak Ahaadith of Rasulullah (Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam) and the verdicts of the Sahaabah (with all the related sciences that are required to understand Deen), deduce the masaail of Deen and explain to the Ummah the parameters of Shariah. Hence it would be a futile exercise for the person who is not knowledgeable and completely conversant with all the above-mentioned sciences of Deen, to try to challenge their verdicts. The Fuqaha have explained in the light of Shariah that it is impermissible for a woman to cut or trim her hair. Hence, If a woman cuts her hair, she will be sinful in the court of Allah Taala. Hazrat Aisha (Radiyallahu Anha) herself explains the reason for her hair not being very long. She says I had fallen ill and I suffered from hair loss until my hair became very short.

The fuqaha have mentioned that it is makruh (disapproved) to cut the hair without a valid reason. The basis of this is a narration of Abu Dawud in which Rasulullah (sallallahu alaihi wasallam) said, \"Any woman who cuts her hair (unnecessarily), she will be deprived of her hair on the Day of Qiyamah.\" (Sunan Abi Dawud, no. 1986)\n\nHowever, there are several exceptions to this. Cutting the hair is permissible in the following cases:\n\n1) Imitating the kuffar or men: It is not permissible for women to cut their hair in order to imitate the disbelievers or men. Rasulullah (sallallahu alaihi wasallam) cursed the women who imitate men and those men who imitate women. (Sahih al-Bukhari, no. 5546)\n\n2) Necessity or need: It is permissible to cut the hair in the case of necessity or need. For example, if a woman has an ailment in her hair, or if there is excessive hair fall, or if the hair is causing her extreme discomfort, it will be permissible to cut the hair. Similarly, if a woman has tied her hair in a way that it cannot be untied, or if there is a need to cut the hair for undergoing a surgery, it will be permissible in such cases.\n\n3) 'Urf (culture): If the majority of Muslim women in a place do not keep their hair long, it will be permissible to abide by the norm. In a hadith, Rasulullah (sallallahu alaihi wasallam) is reported to have said, \"Whatever is considered good by the Muslims, it is good in the sight of Allah.\" (Musnad Ahmad, no. 20496) In another hadith, Rasulullah (sallallahu alaihi wasallam) is reported to have said, \"What the Muslims consider to be good is good in the sight of Allah.\" (Sunan Ibn Majah, no. 4014)\n\nThe hadith of Sayyidah 'A'ishah (radiyallahu 'anha) having short hair is recorded by Imam Bukhari (rahimahullah) in his Sahih.

Bushair was a hypocrite who would recite poetry reviling the Companions of the Prophet () then he would attribute it to some of the Arabs. Then he would say: So-and-so said this and that [So-and-so said this and that]. So when the Companions of the Prophet () would hear that poetry, they would say: By Allah! No one but this filthy person said this poetry - or as the man said - and they would say: Ibn Al-Ubairiq said it.\" He said: \"They were a poor and needy household during Jahiliyyah and Islam. The only food the people of Al-Madinah had was dates and barely. When a man was able to, he would import flour from Ash-Sham which he bought and kept for himself. As for his dependants, their only food was dates and barely. So an import arrived from Ash-Sham, and my uncle Rifaah bin Zaid bought a load of it, which he put in a storage area he had, where he kept his weapons - his shield and his sword. But it was taken from him from under the house. The storage was broken into and and the food and weapons were taken. In the morning, my uncle Rifaah came to me and said: O my nephew! We were robbed during the night, our storage was broken into, and our food and weapons are gone.\" He said: \"They overheard us in the house, and questioned us, and someone said to us, We saw Banu Ubairiq cooking during the night, and it looked like they had some of your food.\" He said: \"Banu Ubairiq were saying - while we were questioning them amidst their dwellings - By Allah! We do not think the one you are looking for is other than Labid bin Sahl, a man among us who is righteous and accepted Islam. When Labid heard that, he brandished his sword and said: I stole? By Allah! You either prove this theft, or I take to you with this sword. They said: Leave us O man! You are not the one who has it. So we continued questioning in the dwellings until we had no doubt that they had taken it. So my uncle said to me: O my nephew! You should go to the Messenger of Allah () and tell him about that.\" Qatadah said: \"So I went to the Messenger of Allah () and said: A family among us are ill-mannered, and they conspired against my uncle Rifaah bin aid. They broken into his storage and took his weapons and his food. We want them to return our weapons, but we have no need for the food. So the Prophet () said: I will decide about that. So when Banu Ubairiq heard about that, they brought a man from among them named Usair bin Urwah to talk to him about that, and some people form their houses gathered and said: O Messenger of Allah! Qatadah bin An-Numan and his uncle came came to a family among us who are a people of Islam and righteousness, accusing them of stealing without proof or confirmation.\" Qatadah said: \"I went to the Messenger of Allah () and spoke to him, and he said: You went to a family among them known for their Islam and righteousness, and accused them of stealing without confirmation or proof.\" He said: \"So I returned wishing that I had lost some of my wealth, and that the Messenger of Allah () had not been spoke to about that. My uncle Rifaah came to me and said: O my nephew! What did you do? So I told him what the Messenger of Allah () said to me, so he said: It is from Allah, Whom we seek help. It was not long before the Quran was revealed: Surely, We have sent down to you the Book in truth, that you might judge between men by that which Allah has shown you, so be not a pelader for the treacherous. That is Banu Ubairiq. And seek forgiveness from Allah. [That is] from what you said to Qatadah. Certainly Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful. And argue not on behalf of those who deceive themselves. Verily, Allah does not like anyone who is a betrayer, sinner. They may hide from men, but they cannot hide from Allah for He is with them up to His saying: Most Merciful. That is: If you seek Allahs forgiveness then He will forgive you. And whoever earns sin, he earns it only against himself... up to His saying: A manifest sin. Their saying about Labid; Had it not been for the grace of Allah and His Mercy upon you... up to His saying: We shall give him a great reward.

Only those who are endowed with understanding keep this in mind\" (Quran 39:9) underscores the value of knowledge and, by extension, those who possess it.\n\nIn Islamic tradition, there are guidelines on how to interact with scholars.

The key is the manner in which this is done.\n\nArguing or talking back to a scholar is not inherently haram if done respectfully. Islam encourages the pursuit of knowledge and seeking clarification. However, the approach is crucial. Engaging in a discussion with a scholar in a casual, non-confrontational manner can be acceptable, provided the tone remains respectful and inquisitive rather than confrontational.\n\nThe etiquette for such interactions includes being polite, listening attentively to the scholar's viewpoint, and presenting one's questions or alternative perspectives in a clear, non-aggressive way. The aim should be to learn or understand, rather than to challenge the scholar's authority.\n\nThat being said, certain conditions should be met:\n1. **Intention**: The intention behind engaging in a discussion should be to seek knowledge or clarify a point, not to challenge the scholar's authority for the sake of argument.\n2. **Manner**: The discussion should be conducted in a respectful and polite manner, avoiding aggression or disrespect.\n3. **Awareness of one's limitations**: Recognizing the limits of one's own knowledge and being humble in the discussion.\n\nIn summary, talking back or arguing with a scholar is not haram if done with the right intention, in a respectful manner, and with the aim of seeking knowledge or understanding.

In Islamic jurisprudence, the consumption of alcohol is considered haram (forbidden). However, the question of whether the water becomes impure (najis) after being in the same bottle as someone who has consumed alcohol is more related to the concept of najasah (impurity).\n\n## Step 3: Explaining Najasah and Its Implications\nIn Islamic law, najasah refers to ritual impurity. Alcohol is considered najis. If alcohol comes into contact with water, the water can become najis if the alcohol is present in a significant amount. However, if the amount of alcohol is negligible or has been diluted significantly, the water might still be considered pure for consumption, depending on the school of thought.\n\n## Step 4: Addressing the Second Question\nThe second question concerns maintaining the purity of utensils and the house for prayers when a family member is alcoholic. This involves ensuring that utensils and surfaces that come into contact with alcohol or are used by the alcoholic family member are cleaned properly to avoid najasah.\n\n## Step 5: Providing Guidance on Maintaining Purity\nTo maintain purity, one should ensure that any utensil or surface that has come into contact with alcohol is washed thoroughly. The act of washing should be done in a manner that removes any trace of the alcohol. For utensils, washing with water is generally considered sufficient if the utensil has been used for alcohol. For the house, surfaces that have come into contact with alcohol should be cleaned.\n\n## Step 6: Continuous Cleaning vs. Necessary Precautions\nIt's not necessary to keep cleaning continuously. Instead, one should take necessary precautions when they know that the alcoholic family member has used a particular utensil or surface. Regular cleaning and being mindful of when and how alcohol is consumed in the home can help maintain purity.\n\n## Step 7: Conclusion\nFor the water to be considered pure, it would depend on whether the bottle has come into direct contact with alcohol. If the soft drink was consumed from the bottle and then water was drunk from the same bottle without it having been washed, the water could"}

Narrated Sa`id: While we were at the house of Ibn `Abbas, Ibn `Abbas said, \"Ask me (any question)\" I said, \"O Abu `Abbas! May Allah let me be sacrificed for you ! There is a man at Kufa who is a storyteller called Nauf; who claims that he (Al-Khadirs companion) is not Moses of Bani Israel.\" As for `Amr, he said to me, \"Ibn `Abbas said, \"(Nauf) the enemy of Allah told a lie.\" But Ya`la said to me, \"Ibn `Abbas said, Ubai bin Ka`b said, Allahs Apostle said, Once Moses, Allahs Apostle, preached to the people till their eyes shed tears and their hearts became tender, whereupon he finished his sermon. Then a man came to Moses and asked, O Allahs Apostle! Is there anyone on the earth who is more learned than you? Moses replied, No. So Allah admonished him (Moses), for he did not ascribe all knowledge to Allah. It was said, (on behalf of Allah), Yes, (there is a slave of ours who knows more than you ). Moses said, O my Lord! Where is he? Allah said, At the junction of the two seas. Moses said, O my Lord ! Tell I me of a sign whereby I will recognize the place. \" `Amr said to me, Allah said, \"That place will be where the fish will leave you.\" Ya`la said to me, \"Allah said (to Moses), Take a dead fish (and your goal will be) the place where it will become alive. \" So Moses took a fish and put it in a basket and said to his boy-servant \"I dont want to trouble you, except that you should inform me as soon as this fish leaves you.\" He said (to Moses).\" You have not demanded too much.\" And that is as mentioned by Allah: And (remember) when Moses said to his attendant ....  (18.60) Yusha` bin Noon. (Sa`id did not state that). The Prophet said, \"While the attendant was in the shade of the rock at a wet place, the fish slipped out (alive) while Moses was sleeping. His attend an said (to himself), \"I will not wake him, but when he woke up, he forgot to tell him The fish slipped out and entered the sea. Allah stopped the flow of the sea. where the fish was, so that its trace looked as if it was made on a rock. `Amr forming a hole with his two thumbs an index fingers, said to me, \"Like this, as in its trace was made on a rock.\" Moses said \"We have suffered much fatigue on this journey of ours.\" (This was not narrated by Sa`id). Then they returned back and found Al-Khadir. `Uthman bin Abi Sulaiman said to me, (they found him) on a green carpet in the middle of the sea. Al-Khadir was covered with his garment with one end under his feet and the other end under his head. When Moses greeted, he uncovered his face and said astonishingly, Is there such a greeting in my land? Who are you? Moses said, I am Moses. Al- Khadir said, Are you the Moses of Bani Israel? Moses said, Yes. Al-Khadir said, \"What do you want? Moses said,  I came to you so that you may teach me of the truth which you were taught. Al- Khadir said, Is it not sufficient for you that the Torah is in your hands and the Divine Inspiration comes to you, O Moses? Verily, I have a knowledge that you ought not learn, and you have a knowledge which I ought not learn. At that time a bird took with its beak (some water) from the sea: Al-Khadir then said, By Allah, my knowledge and your knowledge besides Allahs Knowledge is like what this bird has taken with its beak from the sea. Until, when they went on board the boat (18.71). They found a small boat which used to carry the people from this sea-side to the other sea-side. The crew recognized Al-Khadir and said, The pious slave of Allah. (We said to Sa`id \"Was that Khadir?\" He said, \"Yes.\") The boat men said, We will not get him on board with fare. Al-Khadir scuttled the boat and then plugged the hole with a piece o wood. Moses said, Have you scuttle it in order to drown these people surely, you have done a dreadful thing. (18.71) (Mujahid said. \"Moses said so protestingly.\") Al-Khadir said, didnt I say that you can have no patience with me? (18.72) The first inquiry of Moses was done because of forget fullness, the second caused him to be bound with a stipulation, and the third was done he intentionally. Moses said, Call me not to account for what I forgot and be not hard upon me for my affair (with you). (18.73) (Then) they found a boy and Al-Khadir killed him. Ya`la- said: Sa`id said They found boys playing and Al-Khadir got hold of a handsome infidel boy laid him down and then slew him with knife. Moses said, Have you killed a innocent soul who has killed nobody (18.74) Then they proceeded and found a wall which was on the point of falling down, and Al-Khadir set it up straight Sa`id moved his hand thus and said Al-Khadir raised his hand and the wall became straight. Ya`la said, I think Sa`id said, Al-Khadir touched the wall with his hand and it became straight (Moses said to Al-Khadir), If you had wished, you could have taken wages for it. Sa`id said, Wages that we might had eaten. And there was a king in furor (ahead) of them\" (18.79) And there was in front of them. Ibn `Abbas recited: In front of them (was) a king. It is said on the authority of somebody other than Sa`id that the king was Hudad bin Budad. They say that the boy was called Haisur. A king who seized every ship by force. (18.79) So I wished that if that boat passed by him, he would leave it because of its defect and when they have passed they would repair it and get benefit from it. Some people said that they closed that hole with a bottle, and some said with tar. His parents were believers, and he (the boy) was a non-believer and we(Khadir) feared lest he would oppress them by obstinate rebellion and disbelief. (18.80) (i.e. that their love for him would urge them to follow him in his religion, so we (Khadir) desired that their Lord should change him for them for one better in righteousness and near to mercy (18:81). This was in reply to Moses saying: Have you killed an innocent soul.? (18.74). Near to mercy\" means they will be more merciful to him than they were to the former whom Khadir had killed.

When you have had intimate relations, it's considered that your body or clothes might become junub (ritually impure), requiring a ghusl (full-body ritual bath) for purification before performing prayers or other acts that require ritual purity.\n\nRegarding your question, if your hand is impure (junub or contaminated with semen or other impure substances) and it comes into contact with other surfaces like a table, the surface is considered to be contaminated.\n\nThe Islamic ruling on cleaning an impure surface varies slightly among different schools of thought, but generally, the surface needs to be cleaned according to the type of impurity and the nature of the surface.\n\n1. **Type of Impurity**: If the impurity is visible (e.g., semen), the surface needs to be cleaned in a way that removes the impurity.\n   \n2. **Method of Cleaning**: For many scholars, including those from the Shafi'i and Hanbali schools, the surface should be washed with water. The number of washes can depend on the specifics of the impurity. For some impurities, a single wash is considered sufficient if it effectively removes the impurity, while for others, multiple washes are recommended.\n\nFor a surface contaminated by an impure hand, wiping with a wet cloth or tissue can be a preliminary step to remove the impurity. The effectiveness of this action can depend on the nature of the impurity (dry, wet, visible, etc.).\n\n- **If the impurity is dry or not visible**: A single wipe with a wet cloth might be enough to remove the impurity, especially if the surface appears clean afterward.\n\n- **If the impurity is visible or wet**: You might need to ensure that the impurity is fully removed, potentially requiring more than one wipe or a more thorough washing.\n\nThe specific number (once, three times, etc.) can depend on the juristic opinion being followed:\n\n- **Some scholars** suggest that as long as the impurity is removed, the surface is considered clean. The number of times you need to clean it might depend on the visibility or presence of the impurity after the first cleaning.\n\n- **Three times is a common recommendation** in some fiqh traditions for certain types of impurities, as it is believed to ensure thorough removal.

This period is considered \"clean\" or \"tuhr\" (purity).\n    3.  **Continuous Brown Discharge**: The continuous brown discharge for nearly a month following the 18 clean days complicates the determination.

Generally:\n\n    *   If a woman has a history of regular cycles, her hayd is determined based on her past cycle patterns.\n    *   If she has never had a regular cycle or is uncertain, other factors like the characteristics of the blood and the duration are considered.\n    *   For a woman with continuous bleeding or discharge that does not clearly fit"}

Musahara refers to a situation where an individual is alone with a non-mahram (someone they are not closely related to by blood or marriage, and thus, permissible to marry) of the opposite gender. The rules surrounding musahara are based on Islamic jurisprudence and are intended to prevent situations that could lead to inappropriate or forbidden interactions.\n\n1. **Physical Contact and Musahara**: The ruling of musahara becomes relevant when there's a risk of falling into sinful behavior, such as having inappropriate desires. Direct physical contact between a non-mahram man and woman is generally discouraged if it's done with lust. The presence of lust is a crucial factor.\n\n2. **Touching Through a Barrier**: If there's a barrier between them but body heat can be felt, some scholars might consider this akin to direct touch if the barrier is thin enough that the heat is palpable. However, this can vary depending on the interpretation.\n\n3. **Feeling Body Heat Without Touch**: If a person feels the body heat of a non-mahram individual without any physical contact, and they experience lust, the question arises whether this necessitates musahara. The key factor here is the presence of lust. However, most scholars would agree that simply feeling body heat without any intent or action to be close is not considered musahara.\n\n4. **Lust and Erection**: The condition of having lust is generally considered sufficient for many rulings related to interactions between non-mahrams. Erection is not necessarily a required condition for the ruling to apply; the presence of lust is what's critical. Erection might be seen as a more intense manifestation of lust, but the absence of erection doesn't mean the individual is not experiencing lust.\n\nIn summary, musahara typically involves being alone with a non-mahram of the opposite gender. The rulings around it are more about the context of being alone rather than the specific actions like touching or feeling body heat. While the presence of lust is a significant factor in many Islamic rulings regarding interactions between non-mahrams, simply feeling body heat without any physical contact or being intentionally close is generally not considered musahara by itself.\n\nIt's always best to consult with a knowledgeable Islamic scholar for specific guidance, as interpretations can vary."}

Here's a general overview:\n\n**Touching pork:**\nIn Islamic jurisprudence, touching pork is not considered a sin in itself, but it's considered makruh (disapproved) by some schools of thought. However, if you touch pork and then don't perform the necessary purification rituals before performing prayers or handling the Quran, it could be considered a minor issue. Most Islamic scholars agree that simply touching pork doesn't render you impure, but it's recommended to wash your hands afterward.\n\nThe Quran doesn't explicitly prohibit touching pork; it prohibits consuming it (Quran 5:3, 6:145). The hadiths (Prophetic narrations) also don't explicitly state that touching pork is haram. However, some hadiths suggest that one should avoid contact with pigs or impure substances.\n\n**Serving haram meat and receiving pay:**\nAs for serving haram meat, the issue is more complex. If you're serving haram meat as part of your job, you're not necessarily committing a sin, as you're simply performing your duties. However, if you're actively promoting or encouraging the consumption of haram meat, that could be considered problematic.\n\nRegarding your pay, Islamic scholars generally agree that receiving a salary for serving haram meat doesn't necessarily render your income haram. The key factor is your intention: if you're working to earn a living and not actively promoting or endorsing the sale of haram meat, your pay is likely considered halal.\n\nThat being said, some scholars argue that if a significant portion of the restaurant's revenue comes from the sale of haram meat, it could be considered problematic to receive a salary from that income.\n\nTo alleviate any concerns, you may want to consider the following:\n\n1. **Speak with your employer:** Discuss your concerns with your employer and explore the possibility of being assigned to tasks that don't involve handling or serving haram meat.\n2. **Look into alternative employment:** If you're uncomfortable working in an environment where haram meat is served, you may want to consider looking for alternative employment opportunities that align better with your values.\n3. **Seek guidance from a trusted Islamic scholar:** Consult with a trusted Islamic scholar or a local Islamic organization to get personalized guidance on your specific situation.\n\nKeep in mind that Islamic rulings can vary depending on the specific school of thought or cultural context. Ultimately, it's essential to follow your own conscience and make informed decisions based on your understanding of Islamic principles."}

It was said to him: O Messenger of Allah, what do you think of the fat of dead animals, for it is used to caulk ships, it is daubed on animal skins and people use it to light their lamps?

Then the Messenger of Allah () said: May Allah curse the jews, for Allah forbade them the fat (of animals) but they rendered it, (i.e. melted it) sold it and consumed its price.\"<D>It was narraterd from Jabir bin Abdullah that, during the year of the Conquest, while he was in Makkah, he heard the Messenger of Allah say:\"Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, and His Messenger have forbidden the sale of alcohol, dead meat, pigs and idols.\" It was said to him: \"O Messenger of Allah, what do you think of their fat of dead animals, for it is used to caulk ships, it is daubed on animal skins, and people use it to light their lamps?\" He said: \"No, it is unlawful.\" Then the Messenger of Allah said: \"May Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, curse the Jews, for Allah forbade them the fat (of dead animals) but they rendered it, sold it, and consumed its price.\"<D>Narrated Aisha:(the wife of the Prophet) \"Whenever Allahs Apostle intended to go on a journey, he would draw lots amongst his wives and would take with him the one upon whom the lot fell. During a Ghazwa of his, he drew lots amongst us and the lot fell upon me, and I proceeded with him after Allah had decreed the use of the veil by women. I was carried in a Howdah (on the camel) and dismounted while still in it. When Allahs Apostle was through with his Ghazwa and returned home, and we approached the city of Medina, Allahs Apostle ordered us to proceed at night. When the order of setting off was given, I walked till I was past the army to answer the call of nature. After finishing I returned (to the camp) to depart (with the others) and suddenly realized that my necklace over my chest was missing. So, I returned to look for it and was delayed because of that. The people who used to carry me on the camel, came to my Howdah and put it on the back of the camel, thinking that I was in it, as, at that time, women were light in weight, and thin and lean, and did not use to eat much. So, those people did not feel the difference in the heaviness of the Howdah while lifting it, and they put it over the camel. At that time I was a young lady. They set the camel moving and proceeded on. I found my necklace after the army had gone, and came to their camp to find nobody. So, I went to the place where I used to stay, thinking that they would discover my absence and come back in my search. While in that state, I felt sleepy and slept. Safwan bin Muattal As-Sulami Adh-Dhakwani was behind the army and reached my abode in the morning. When he saw a sleeping person, he came to me, and he used to see me before veiling. So, I got up when I heard him saying, \"Inna lil-lah-wa inn a ilaihi rajiun (We are for Allah, and we will return to Him).\" He made his camel knell down. He got down from his camel, and put his leg on the front legs of the camel and then I rode and sat over it. Safwan set out walking, leading the camel by the rope till we reached the army who had halted to take rest at midday. Then whoever was meant for destruction, fell into destruction, (some people accused me falsely) and the leader of the false accusers was `Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul. After that we returned to Medina, and I became ill for one month while the people were spreading the forged statements of the false accusers. I was feeling during my ailment as if I were not receiving the usual kindness from the Prophet which I used to receive from him when I got sick. But he would come, greet and say, How is that (girl)? I did not know anything of what was going on till I recovered from my ailment and went out with Um Mistah to the Manasi where we used to answer the call of nature, and we used not to go to answer the call of nature except from night to night and that was before we had lavatories near to our houses. And this habit of ours was similar to the habit of the old Arabs in the open country (or away from houses). So. I and Um Mistah bint Ruhm went out walking. Um Mistah stumbled because of her long dress and on that she said, Let Mistah be ruined. I said, You are saying a bad word. Why are you abusing a man who took part in (the battle of) Badr? She said, O Hanata (you there) didnt you hear what they said? Then she told me the rumors of the false accusers. My sickness was aggravated, and when I returned home, Allahs Apostle came to me, and after greeting he said, How is that (girl)? I requested him to allow me to go to my parents. I wanted then to be sure of the news through them I Allahs Apostle allowed me, and I went to my parents and asked my mother, What are the people talking about? She said, O my daughter! Dont worry much about this matter. By Allah, never is there a charming woman loved by her husband who has other wives, but the women would forge false news about her. I said, Glorified be Allah! Are the people really taking of this matter? That night I kept on weeping and could not sleep till morning. In the morning Allahs Apostle called `Ali bin Abu Talib and Usama bin Zaid when he saw the Divine Inspiration delayed, to consul them about divorcing his wife (i.e. `Aisha). Usama bin Zaid said what he knew of the good reputation of his wives and added, O Allahs Apostle! Keep you wife, for, by Allah, we know nothing about her but good. `Ali bin Abu Talib said, O Allahs Apostle! Allah has no imposed restrictions on you, and there are many women other than she, yet you may ask the woman-servant who will tell you the truth. On that Allahs Apostle called Buraira and said, O Burair. Did you ever see anything which roused your suspicions about her? Buraira said, No, by Allah Who has sent you with the Truth, I have never seen in her anything faulty except that she is a girl of immature age, who sometimes sleeps and leaves the dough for the goats to eat. On that day Allahs Apostle ascended the pulpit and requested that somebody support him in punishing `Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul. Allahs Apostle said, Who will support me to punish that person (`Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul) who has hurt me by slandering the reputation of my family? By Allah, I know nothing about my family but good, and they have accused a person about whom I know nothing except good, and he never entered my house except in my company. Sa`d bin Mu`adh got up and said, O Allahs Apostle! by Allah, I will relieve you from him. If that man is from the tribe of the Aus, then we will chop his head off, and if he is from our brothers, the Khazraj, then order us, and we will fulfill your order. On that Sa`d bin Ubada, the chief of the Khazraj and before this incident, he had been a pious man, got up, motivated by his zeal for his tribe and said, By Allah, you have told a lie; you cannot kill him, and you will never be able to kill him. On that Usaid bin Al-Hadir got up and said (to Sa`d bin Ubada), By Allah! you are a liar. By Allah, we will kill him; and you are a hypocrite, defending the hypocrites. On this the two tribes of Aus and Khazraj got excited and were about to fight each other, while Allahs Apostle was standing on the pulpit. He got down and quieted them till they became silent and he kept quiet. On that day I kept on weeping so much so that neither did my tears stop, nor could I sleep. In the morning my parents were with me and I had wept for two nights and a day, till I thought my liver would burst from weeping. While they were sitting with me and I was weeping, an Ansari woman asked my permission to enter, and I allowed her to come in. She sat down and started weeping with me. While we were in this state, Allahs Apostle came and sat down and he had never sat with me since the day they forged the accusation. No revelation regarding my case came to him for a month. He recited Tashah-hud (i.e. None has the right to be worshipped but Allah and Muhammad is His Apostle) and then said, O `Aisha! I have been informed such-and-such about you; if you are innocent, then Allah will soon reveal your innocence, and if you have committed a sin, then repent to Allah and ask Him to forgive you, for when a person confesses his sin and asks Allah for forgiveness, Allah accepts his repentance. When Allahs Apostle finished his speech my tears ceased completely and there remained not even a single drop of it. I requested my father to reply to Allahs Apostle on my behalf. My father said, By Allah, I do not know what to say to Allahs Apostle. I said to my mother, Talk to Allahs Apostle on my behalf. She said, By Allah, I do not know what to say to Allahs Apostle. I was a young girl and did not have much knowledge of the Quran. I said. I know, by Allah, that you have listened to what people are saying and that has been planted in your minds and you have taken it as a truth. Now, if I told you that I am innocent and Allah knows that I am innocent, you would not believe me and if I confessed to you falsely that I am guilty, and Allah knows that I am innocent you would believe me. By Allah, I dont compare my situation with you except to the situation of Josephs father (i.e. Jacob) who said, So (for me) patience is most fitting against that which you assert and it is Allah (Alone) whose help can be sought. Then I turned to the other side of my bed hoping that Allah would prove my innocence. By Allah I never thought that Allah would reveal Divine Inspiration in my case, as I considered myself too inferior to be talked of in the Holy Quran. I had hoped that Allahs Apostle might have a dream in which Allah would prove my innocence. By Allah, Allahs Apostle had not got up and nobody had left the house before the Divine Inspiration came to Allahs Apostle. So, there overtook him the same state which used to overtake him, (when he used to have, on being inspired divinely). He was sweating so much so that the drops of the sweat were dropping like pearls though it was a (cold) wintry day. When that state of Allahs Apostle was over, he was smiling and the first word he said, `Aisha! Thank Allah, for Allah has declared your innocence. My mother told me to go to Allahs Apostle . I replied, By Allah I will not go to him and will not thank but Allah. So Allah revealed: \"Verily! They who spread the slander are a gang among you . . .\" (24.11) When Allah gave the declaration of my Innocence, Abu Bakr, who used to provide for Mistah bin Uthatha for he was his relative, said, By Allah, I will never provide Mistah with anything because of what he said about Aisha. But Allah later revealed: -- \"And let not those who are good and wealthy among you swear not to help their kinsmen, those in need and those who left their homes in Allahs Cause. Let them forgive and overlook. Do you not wish that Allah should forgive you? Verily! Allah is Oft-forgiving, Most Merciful.\" (24.22) After that Abu Bakr said, Yes ! By Allah! I like that Allah should forgive me, and resumed helping Mistah whom he used to help before. Allahs Apostle also asked Zainab bint Jahsh (i.e. the Prophets wife about me saying, What do you know and what did you see? She replied, O Allahs Apostle! I refrain to claim hearing or seeing what I have not heard or seen. By Allah, I know nothing except goodness about Aisha.\" Aisha further added \"Zainab was competing with me (in her beauty and the Prophets love), yet Allah protected her (from being malicious), for she had piety.\"<D>(And those who look not for a meeting with Us) those who do not believe in resurrection after death, i.e. Abu Jahl and his host (say: Why are angels not sent down unto us) to inform us that Allah sent you to us (and (why) do we not see our Lord) to ask Him about you? (Assuredly they think too highly of themselves) to simply believe; it is also said that this means: they think too highly of themselves when they ask to see Allah, (and are scornful with great pride) refusing to believe; it is also said that they dared to ask for a tremendous thing when they asked for the angels to come to them.<D>(Allah hath decreed: Lo! I verily shall conquer, I and My messengers) i.e. Muhammad (pbuh) they shall conquer Persia, Byzantium, the hypocrites and the Jews. (Lo! Allah is Strong) through giving help to his prophets, (Almighty) in retribution against His enemies. This was revealed about Abdullah Ibn Ubayy Ibn Salul who said to the true believers: Do you really think that you shall conquer Persia and Byzantium?.<D>(Then said: Lo! I feel sick!) so that they leave him alone. ", "Generated_Answer": "Salam (peace) be upon you, T. I understand that you're going through a tough time, feeling like you're under a microscope, and you're unsure why people around you seem to be reacting negatively. You're also struggling with self-doubt and feelings of guilt without a clear reason. I'll offer some Islamic guidance that might help.\n\n1. **Self-Reflection and Introspection**: The Quran encourages believers to reflect on their actions and selves. \"And indeed, We have created many of the jinn and mankind for Hell. They have hearts wherewith they understand not, and they have eyes wherewith they see not, and they have ears wherewith they hear not\" (Quran 7:179). Reflecting on your actions and ensuring they align with Islamic teachings can be a good starting point. Consider if there's something specific you're doing that might be causing these reactions.\n\n2. **Dua (Supplication)**: Turning to Allah in supplication can be a source of comfort. You can recite specific duas for relief and guidance. For example, the Prophet (peace be upon him) used to say, \"Allahumma inni a'udhu bika min al-hamm wa al-huzn\" (O Allah, I seek refuge in You from worry and grief) (Bukhari). You can also ask Allah to guide you to understand the reasons behind these feelings and to rectify any wrongdoing: \"Rabbana atina fi al-dunya hasanah wa fi al-akhirah hasanah wa qina azab al-nar\" (Our Lord, give us good in this world and good in the hereafter, and protect us from the Fire) (Quran 2:201).\n\n3. **Improving Your Character**: The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) said, \"I have been sent to perfect good character\" (Muwatta Malik). Working on your character and manners can positively impact how others perceive you. This includes being kind, honest, and fair in your dealings.\n\n4. **Seeking Knowledge**: Sometimes, feelings of guilt or confusion can stem from a lack of understanding or misinterpretation of Islamic teachings. Engaging in Islamic studies or seeking guidance from knowledgeable individuals can provide clarity.\n\n5. **Surrounding Yourself with Good Company**: The company you keep can significantly influence your feelings and behavior. The Prophet (peace be upon him) advised, \"A man follows the religion of his close friend, so let one of you look carefully at whom he"}

", "Generated_Answer": "A: In Islamic jurisprudence, istibraa refers to the act of ensuring that no more urine is coming out after urinating, typically done by a man pulling on his private part or waiting for a short period. If after istibraa and removing all drops, you're certain that you've cleaned yourself properly and no more urine is coming out, but you feel like drops are coming out when you wash yourself or have a bath, this situation can be addressed by understanding the nature of your concern.\n\n1. **Understanding the Issue**: The feeling of drops coming out after washing or bathing could be due to a couple of reasons. It might be actual urine leakage, or it could be water entering the urethra and giving the sensation of urine release. If it's the latter, it's more of a psychological or perceptual issue rather than actual urine leakage.\n\n2. **Checking for Urine Leakage**: First, ensure that you're performing istibraa correctly and that your bladder is fully emptied after using the bathroom. Sometimes, a weak bladder or other medical conditions can cause incontinence. If you're experiencing continuous or frequent leakage, it might be worth consulting a healthcare professional.\n\n3. **Addressing the Perception**: If you're confident that you've emptied your bladder and you're not experiencing actual leakage, the sensation could be due to water entering the urethra during washing. To minimize this, you can try drying your genital area thoroughly before washing the rest of your body. When washing, be gentle, and avoid using strong jets of water.\n\n4. **Precautions During Bathing**: To minimize the sensation of drops coming out, you can take a few precautions:\n   - Clean your genital area gently and dry it before proceeding with the rest of your bath.\n   - Avoid using hot water directly on your genital area as it might cause relaxation of the muscles, potentially making the sensation more likely.\n   - When washing your genital area, do so gently to minimize water entering the urethra.\n\n5. **Consulting a Professional**: If the issue persists and causes you distress, it might be helpful to consult a healthcare provider to rule out any underlying medical conditions. They can offer advice tailored to your specific situation.\n\n6. **Psychological Aspect**: Sometimes, being overly conscious of the issue can exacerbate the problem. Practicing relaxation techniques or seeking reassurance from a healthcare provider might help.\n\n7. **Islamic Ruling**: From an Islamic perspective, if you're certain that you've cleaned yourself properly after urinating and have performed istibraa correctly,"}

Samit reported:I and my father set out in search of knowledge to a tribe of the Ansar before their death (i. e. before the Companions of the Holy Prophet left the world) and I was the first to meet Abu Yasar, a Companion of Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) and there was a young man with him who carried the record of letters with him and there was a mantle prepared by the tribe of Maafiri upon him. And his servant too had a Maafiri mantle over him. My father said to him: My uncle, I see the signs of anger or that of agony on your face. He said: Yes, such and such person, the son of so and so, of the tribe of Harami owed me a debt. I went to his family, extended salutations and said: Where is he? They said: He is not here. Then came out to me his son who was at the threshold of his youth. I said to him: Where is your father? He said: No sooner did he hear your sound than he hid himself behind my mothers bedstead. I said to him: Walk out to me, for I know where you are. He came out. I said to him: What prompted you to hide yourself from me? He said: By God, whatever I would say to you would not be a lie. By Allah, I fear that I should tell a lie to you and in case of making promise with you I should break it, as you are the Companion of Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him). The fact is that I was hard up in regard to money. I said: Do you adjure by Allah? He said: I adjure by Allah. I said: Do you adjure by Allah? He said: I adjure by Allah. I said: Do you adjure by Allah? He said: I adjure by Allah. Then he brought his promissory note and he wrote off (the debt) with his hand and said: Make payment when you find yourself solvent enough to pay me back; if you are not, then there is no liability upon you. These two eyes of mine saw, and he (AbuI-Yasar) placed his fingers upon his eyes and these two ears of mine heard and my heart retained, and he pointed towards his heart that Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: He who gives time to one who is financially hard up (in the payment of debt) or writes off his debt, Allah will provide him His shadow. I said to him: My uncle, if you get the cloak of your servant and you give him your two clothes, or take his two clothes of Maafir and give him your cloak, then there would be one dress for you and one for him. He wiped my head and said: O Allah, bless the son of my brother. O, son of my brother, these two very eyes of mine saw and these two ears of mine listened to and this heart of mine retained this, and he pointed towards the heart that Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: Feed them (the servants) and clothe them (the servants) what you wear, and if I give him the goods of the world, it is easy for me than this that he should take my virtues on the Day of Resurrection. We went on till we came to Jabir b. Abdullah in the mosque and he was busy in observing prayer in one cloth which he had joined at its opposite ends. I made my way through the people till I sat between him and the Qibla and I said: May Allah have mercy upon you. Do you observe prayer with one cloth on your body whereas your mantle is lying at your side? He pointed me with his hand towards my breast just like this and he separated his fingers and bent them in the shape of a bow. And (he said): I thought that a fool like you should come to me so that he should see me as I do and he should then also do like it. Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) came to us in this very mosque and he had in his hand the twig of the palm-tree and he saw mucus towards the Qibla of the mosque and he erased it with the help of the twig. He then came to us and said: Who amongst you likes that Allah should turn His face away from him? We were afraid. He then again said: Who amongst you likes that Allah should turn His face away from him? We were afraid. He again said: Who amongst you likes that Allah should turn His face away from him? We said: Allahs Messenger, none of us likes it. And he said: If one amongst you stands for prayer, Allah, the Exalted and Glorious, is before him he should not spit in front of him, or on his right side, but should spit on his left side beneath his left foot and if he is impelled to do so all of a sudden (in spite of himself) he should then spit in his cloth and fold it in some part of it. (and he further said: ) Bring some sweet-smelling thing. A young man who belonged to our tribe stood up, went and brought scent in his palm. Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) took that and applied it to the end of that twig and then touched the place where there had been mucus. Jabir said: This is why you should apply scent to your mosques. It is reported on the same authority: We set out along with Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) on an expedition of Batn Buwat. He (the Holy Prophet) was in search of al-Majdi b. Amr al-Juhani. (We had so meagre equipment) that five. six or seven of us had one camel to ride and so we mounted it turn by turn. Once there wan. the turn of an Ansari to ride upon the camel. He made it kneel down to ride over it (and after having. mounted it), he tried to raise it up but it hesitated. So he said. May there be curse of Allah upon you! Thereupon Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: Who is there to curse his camel? He said: Allahs Messenger, it is I. Thereupon he said: Get down from the camel and let us not have in our company the cursed one. Dont curse your own selves, nor your children. nor your belongings. There is the possibility that your curse may synchronies with the time when Allah is about to confer upon you what you demand and thus your prayer may be readily responded. It is reported on the same authority: We set out on an expedition along with Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) until it was evening, and we had been near a. water reservoir of Arabia. Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: Who would be the person who would go ahead and set right the reservoir and drink water himself and serve us with it? Jabir said: I stood up and said: Allahs Messenger, it is I who am ready to do that. Thereupon Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: Who is the person to accompany Jabir? And then Jabbar b. Sakhr stood up. So we went to that well and poured in that tank a bucket or two of water and plastered it with clay and then began to fill it (with water) until it was filled to the brim. Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) was the first who appeared before us, and he said: Do you (both) permit me to drink water out of it? We said: Yea, Allahs Messenger. He led his camel to drink water and it drank. He then pulled its rein and it stretched its legs and began to urinate. He then took it aside and made it kneel down at another place and then came to the tank and performed ablution. I then got up and performed ablution like the ablution of Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him), and Jabbar b. Sakhr went in order to relieve himself and Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) got up to observe prayer and there was a mantle over me. I tried to invert its ends but it was too short (to cover my body easily). It had its borders. I then inverted it (the mantle) and drew its opposite ends and then tied them at my neck. I then came and stood upon the left side of Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him). He caught hold of me and made me go round behind him, until he made me stand on his right side. Then Jabbar b. Sakhr came. He performed ablution and then came and stood on the left side of Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him). Then Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) caught hold of our hands together, pushed us back and made us stand behind him. Then Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) began to look upon me with darting looks, but I did not perceive that. After that I became aware of it and he pointed with the gesture of his hand that I should wrap my loin-cloth. When Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) had finished the prayer, he said: Jabir! I said: Allahs Messenger, at thy beck and call. He said: When the cloth around you is inadequate, then tie the opposite ends but when it is small, tie it over the lower body. Jabir reported: We set out on an expedition with Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) and the only means of sustenance for every person amongst us was only one date for a day and we used to chew it. And we struck the leaves with the help of our bow and ate them until the sides of our mouths were injured. It so happened one day that a person was overlooked and not given a date. We carried that person and bore witness to the fact that he had not been given that date so he was offered that and he got up and received that. Jabir reported: We set out on an expedition along with Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) until we got down at a spacious valley and Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) went to relieve himself. I followed him with a bucket full of water and Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) looked about and he found no privacy but two trees at the end of the valley and Allahs Messenger (may. peace be upon him) went to one of them and took hold of one of its twigs and said: Be thou under my control by the permission of Allah, and so it came under his control like the camel who has its nosestring in the hand of its rider, and then he came to the second tree and took hold of a twig and said: Be thou under my control with the permission of Allah, and it came under his control, and when he came in the middle of the two trees he joined together the two twigs and said: join with the permission of Allah. Jabir said: I was afraid lest Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) should be aware of my nearness and go still farther. And Muhammad b. Abbad has used the word\" faitabd\" and I began to talk to myself. And as I saw, I suddenly found Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) before me and the two trees were separated and each one of them was standing at its place. I saw Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) standing for a short time, nodding his head towards right and left. Ismail pointed towards the right and left with the help of his head (in order to demonstrate how the Holy Prophet had pointed). Then he (the Holy Prophet) came to me and said: Jabir did you see my place where I was standing? I said: Allahs Messenger, yes. He then said: Then you should go to those two trees and cut a twig from each of them and go to that place with them where I was standing and stand there where I was standing and place a twig on the right and a twig on the left. Jabir said: I set out and took hold of a stone and broke it and sharpened it and then I came to those trees and cut a twig from each one of them. I then came dragging them until I stood at the place where Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) had been standing and placed a twig on the right and a twig on the left. Then I met him and said: Allahs Messenger, I have done that, but (kindly) explain to me the reason for it. Thereupon he said: I passed by two graves the occupants of which had been undergoing torment. I liked to make intercession for them so that the might be relieved of this torment y as long as these twigs remain fresh. Jabir said: We came back to the (camp of the) army and Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: Jabir, call people for per- forming wudu. I cried: Come and perform wudu, come and perform wudu, come and perform wudu. I said: Allahs Messenger, there is not even a drop of water in the army camp, and there. was a person who used to cool the water for Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) in the old water-skin which kept hanging by the twig. He asked me to go to such and such Ansari and ask him to see if there was any water in that skin. I went to him and cast a glance in it but did not find anything but a drop in the mouth of that water-skin and if I were to draw that, the water-skins,. dried part would suck it up. I came to Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) and said: Allahs Messenger, I have not found anything in it but a drop of water in the mouth of the water-skin and now if I were to draw that, it would be absorbed. He said: Go and bring that to me. I brought that to him. He took hold of it -and began to utter something which I could not understand and then pressed it with his hand and gave that to me and said: Jabir, announce for the tub to be brought. So I announced that the tub of the army (be brought). It was brought accordingly and I placed it before him (the Holy Prophet). Thereupon Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) placed his hands in the tub like this: with his fingers stretched out, and then he placed his fingers at the bottom of the tub and said: Jabir, take it (that waters-skin) and pour water over me, by reciting Bismillah, and I poured water and I said: Bismillah, and found water sprouting out between the fingers of Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him). Then that tub gushed forth until it was filled up and the Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: Jabir, make an announcement to the effect: He who needs water should take that. Jabir said: The people came and got water until they were all satiated. I said: Is there anyone left who wants to get it? And Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) then lifted up his hand from that tub and it was still full. Then the people made a complaint to Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) about hunger and he said: May Allah provide you food! We came to the bank of the ocean and the ocean was tossing and it threw out a big animal and we lit fire and cooked it and took it until we had eaten to our hearts content. Jabir said: I and such and such five persons entered Its socket and nobody could see us until we had come out, and we took hold of one of its ribs and twisted it into a sort of arch, then we called the tallest of the persons of the army and the hugest of the camels of the army and it had the big saddle over it, and it could easily pass through it without the rider having need to bend down.<D>It wasnarrated from Anas bin Malik that the Prophet () said:“Whoeverperforms ablution on Friday, it is well and good for him, andhe hasdone what is obligatory for him.

And among them was al-Harth Ibn Qays al-Sahmi who ate salted fish which made him very thirsty. He drank so much water that his stomach burst open and he died, may Allah ruin him. And among themwas al-Aswad Ibn Abd al-Muttalib whose head Gabriel banged on a tree and then hit his face with thorns until he died, may Allah curse him. And among them is al-Aswad Ibn Abd Yaghuth who left his house in an extremely hot day and was caught by the simoom such that his colour turned black and resembled an Abyssinian. He went back to his house, but they refused to open the door for him. He banged the door with his head so hard that he died, may Allah forsake him. And among them was al-Walid Ibn al-Mughirah al- Makhzumi who died as a result of an arrow which grazed his anklebone, may Allah banish him. All these people used to say before they died: the Lord of Muhammad (pbuh) has killed me.<D>Allah then taught them what they ought to learn in their dealings, saying: (O ye who believe!) in Allah and His Messenger (when ye contract a debt for a fixed term, record it) i.e. the debt (in writing.

(No scribe should refuse to write) the contract between the creditor and the debtor (as Allah hath taught him) how to write, (so let him write) the contract without addition or omission, (and let him who incurreth the debt dictate) i.e. the indebted person should explain to the scribe the debt he owes, (and let him observe his duty to Allah his Lord) let the indebted person fear his Lord, (and diminish naught thereof) and not diminish any amount of debt he owes upon dictation. (But if he who oweth the debt is of low understanding) is ignorant of dictation, (or weak) unable to dictate, (or unable himself to dictate) does not know how to dictate to the scribe, (then let the guardian of his interests dictate) the guardian of his wealth who is the creditor (in (terms of) equity) without any addition. (And call to witness) for your rights, (from among your men, two witnesses) from among your free, Muslim men who are of good character. (And if two men be not (at hand) then a man and two women, of such as ye approve as witnesses) from among people who are reliable in their witness, (so that if the one erreth (through forgetfulness)) so that if one of the women forgets (the other) who did not forget (will remind her. And the witnesses must not refuse) togive witness (when they are summoned) to court. (Be not averse) disinclined (to writing down) i.e. the debt(whether it be small or great, with (record of) the term thereof. That) i.e. that which I mentioned regarding the writing down of the debt (is more equitable) more correct and fairer (in the sight of Allah and more sure for testimony) clearer for the witness when he gives his testimony if he happens to forget, (and the bestway of avoiding doubt between you) concerning the debt and the fixed term of its payment; (save only inthe case when it is actual merchandise which you transfer among yourselves from hand to hand. In that case it is no sin) there is no harm (for you if ye write it not) the transaction. (And have witnesses when ye sell one to another) on credit, (and let no harm be done to scribe) by committing the transaction to writing (or witness) by giving his witness, that is, do not coerce them to do so. (If ye do (harm to them)) if you harm them, (lo! It is a sin in you. Observe your duty to Allah) fear Allah for causing such harm. (Allah is teaching you) what is best for you regarding your dealings. (And Allah is Knower of all things) what is good for you as well as other things.<D>Then the following was revealed about Abdullah Ibn Umayyah al-Makhzumi and his companions who said to the Prophet: make the mountains disappear by means of your Quran; or make springs gush out of them, just as David did with the fount of copper, as you claim; or bring for us a wind by means of which we travel to Historic Syria and return, just as it was done by Solomon, according to you; or bring our dead to life asdid Jesus, as you claim. So Allah said: (Had it been possible for a Lecture) other than the Quran which has been revealed to Muhammad (pbuh) (to cause the mountains to move) by means of which mountains are made to disappear from the face of the earth, (or the earth to be torn asunder) by means of which to travel long distances, (or the dead to speak) or by means of which the dead are brought back to life, the Quran which was revealed to Muhammad (pbuh) would have done so.

While performing Ghusl (ritual bath), it is generally advised to avoid facing or turning one's back towards the Qibla, out of respect.\n\nUsing a bath tub where one's back faces Qibla during Ghusl is not ideal, but there are considerations to be made:\n\n1. **Necessity and Circumstances**: If the bath tub is fixed and altering its position is not feasible due to structural constraints or other practical reasons, the situation is understood. In such a case, performing Ghusl while having one's back towards Qibla is not considered a major issue, as it is not done out of disrespect but due to the circumstances.\n\n2. **Intention and Respect**: The intention behind performing Ghusl is to cleanse oneself ritually, not to disrespect the Qibla. Being mindful of the Qibla's direction and having respect for it is important, but it is also understood that the act of Ghusl itself is not directly related to the direction one faces.\n\n3. **Alternatives and Adjustments**: If possible, one could consider adjustments such as:\n   - Reorienting the bath tub if feasible.\n   - Using a shower or other bathing facilities where one doesn't necessarily have to have their back to Qibla.\n   - Ensuring that during Ghusl, one is not directly facing or having their back to Qibla if there are alternatives available within the same bathroom.\n\n4. **Islamic Rulings**: Islamic rulings (Fatwas) on this matter can vary among different schools of thought. Some may consider it makrooh (disapproved) to face or turn one's back towards the Qibla while relieving oneself or during certain acts, including potentially Ghusl, while others may not consider it a significant issue if done out of necessity or without the intention of disrespect.\n\nIn your situation, if altering the bath tub's position is not feasible, it is not considered a sin to perform Ghusl with your back towards the Qibla, especially if you're doing so out of necessity and not with the intention of disrespecting the direction. However, being aware of the Qibla's significance and showing respect is a part of the Islamic etiquette.\n\nIf you're still concerned, you could consult with a local Islamic scholar or Mufti who can provide guidance based on your specific circumstances and the prevailing Islamic school of thought in your area."}

This Hadith is often cited to discourage men from wearing their trousers or lower garments below their ankles.\n\n1. **Imam Abu Hanifa's view**: According to the Hanafi school, wearing trousers below the ankles is considered makruh (disapproved) if done out of pride or arrogance. However, if the garment is worn below the ankles without the intention of pride, it is not considered haram (forbidden), though it is still considered makruh. The emphasis is on the intention behind the action.\n\n2. **Imam Malik's view**: The Maliki school generally aligns with the view that wearing trousers below the ankles is disapproved, especially if it's out of pride. However, the primary concern is the intention and the context.\n\n3. **Imam Shafi'i's view**: Imam Shafi'i and his followers have a stricter interpretation regarding the Hadith. They generally consider it haram to let the garment hang below the ankles, based on the apparent meaning of the Hadith, regardless of the intention.\n\n4. **Imam Ahmad's view**: Imam Ahmad ibn Hanbal is reported to have held a strict view similar to Imam Shafi'i, considering it haram to wear trousers or garments below the ankles, based on the Hadith.\n\nThe difference of opinion among the four Imams stems from their interpretation of the Hadith, the weight they give to different narrations, and how they understand the context and the reason behind the Prophet's statement. While all four Imams agree that wearing garments in a way that signifies pride or arrogance is not permissible, they differ on whether simply wearing trousers below the ankles without pride constitutes a violation of the Prophetic guidance.\n\nIn summary, there is a nuanced difference of opinion among the four Imams regarding the ruling on wearing trousers above the ankles, mainly centered around the issue of intention and the interpretation of the relevant Hadith."}

However, this state doesn't make everything you touch impure for others. The primary concern is your acts of worship, like prayer and fasting, which are not valid while you're menstruating.\n\n2. **Showering Not for Purification**: If you shower not with the intention of ritual purification (since you're still menstruating and can't pray), but just for cleanliness, your state of ritual impurity doesn't change. You're still considered napaak until you perform the ritual ghusl after your menstruation ends.\n\n3. **Touching Objects While Ritually Impure**: Simply being ritually impure doesn't make everything you touch napaak. For example, if you're menstruating and touch something, that thing doesn't become impure unless you transfer some impurity (like menstrual blood) to it.\n\n4. **Wet Hair and Droplets**: If your hair is wet and droplets fall, they are considered pure unless they've come into contact with an impurity (like menstrual blood). Pure water is considered tahir (pure).\n\n5. **Clothing and Personal Items**: If your clothes or personal items (like your coat or bag) come into contact with impurity (e.g., menstrual blood), they need to be washed. However, if they are merely worn while you're in a state of ritual impurity but haven't come into contact with any actual impurity, they remain pure.\n\n### What to Do?\n\n- **For Your Concerns About Objects and Places**: If you're worried about having made something napaak, check if there's any visible impurity (like blood) on them. If there is, they need to be cleaned. If not, they're considered tahir.\n- **For Your Bed and Other Places**: If there's been no actual impurity (like blood) on them, they remain pure. If there's been an impurity, they need to be cleaned according to Islamic guidelines.\n- **For Your School Items**: If you're concerned about your coat or bag becoming napaak, check them for any visible signs of impurity. If they're clean, they're okay to use. If not, they should be washed.\n- **General Advice**: Continue with your daily routine. If you're concerned about specific items being soiled, inspect them.

If it's for beautification in a context that could lead to inappropriate behavior or is intended to attract undue attention, some scholars might view it unfavorably. However, for many, wearing makeup is simply a part of their daily grooming.\n\n3. **Scholarly Views**: There are varying scholarly opinions on the matter. Some view that wearing makeup per se is not haram (forbidden) but may be considered makrooh (disapproved) if it's excessive or for inappropriate reasons. The critical factor is whether the makeup affects the validity of wudu.\n\n4. **Validity of Wudu**: For wudu to be valid, water must touch all the obligatory parts (face, arms up to the elbows, wiping the head, and washing the feet). If the makeup doesn't prevent water from reaching the skin, then wudu is considered valid.\n\nIn summary, if a woman's makeup doesn't create a barrier that prevents water from reaching her skin during wudu, and if she's not wearing it for inappropriate reasons, she can wear makeup after wudu and then pray. The key is ensuring that her wudu is valid. It's also a good practice to be modest and not excessive in the use of makeup, aligning with Islamic values of humility and modesty.\n\nIt's always a good idea to consult with a knowledgeable Islamic scholar or a trusted religious authority for personalized guidance, as interpretations can vary."}
{"Question": "Q: I have come into contact with a guy at work, who had already researched a lot about Islam via the internet. So Ive explained to him that to be a Muslim he requires belief in Tawhid (Monotheism) and Risaalat (the prophethood of Nabi Sallallahu Alayhi Wasallam). I took him to the Musjid to see how we offer Salaah etc. He says he believes in Monotheism, but now hes got one question. Why could Islam unconditionally stop/forbid Alcohol, while it only regulated Slavery, and did not forbid it? I couldnt answer him, I replied by saying that it was eventually forbidden, and it was over a period of time, so that the people will willingly accept and obey, he was however not satisfied with my answer. Is there anything wrong in what I said? and please provide an answer. ? --T--", "Answer": "Forget about him. Alcohol etc. are secondary issues. There is no point in talking about secondary issues when he has not accepted the fundamental issues. Dont waste your time with such people. And Allah Taala ( ) knows best", "Document": "Narrated Aisha:(the wife of the Prophet) \"Whenever Allahs Apostle intended to go on a journey, he would draw lots amongst his wives and would take with him the one upon whom the lot fell. During a Ghazwa of his, he drew lots amongst us and the lot fell upon me, and I proceeded with him after Allah had decreed the use of the veil by women. I was carried in a Howdah (on the camel) and dismounted while still in it. When Allahs Apostle was through with his Ghazwa and returned home, and we approached the city of Medina, Allahs Apostle ordered us to proceed at night. When the order of setting off was given, I walked till I was past the army to answer the call of nature. After finishing I returned (to the camp) to depart (with the others) and suddenly realized that my necklace over my chest was missing. So, I returned to look for it and was delayed because of that. The people who used to carry me on the camel, came to my Howdah and put it on the back of the camel, thinking that I was in it, as, at that time, women were light in weight, and thin and lean, and did not use to eat much. So, those people did not feel the difference in the heaviness of the Howdah while lifting it, and they put it over the camel. At that time I was a young lady. They set the camel moving and proceeded on. I found my necklace after the army had gone, and came to their camp to find nobody. So, I went to the place where I used to stay, thinking that they would discover my absence and come back in my search. While in that state, I felt sleepy and slept. Safwan bin Muattal As-Sulami Adh-Dhakwani was behind the army and reached my abode in the morning. When he saw a sleeping person, he came to me, and he used to see me before veiling. So, I got up when I heard him saying, \"Inna lil-lah-wa inn a ilaihi rajiun (We are for Allah, and we will return to Him).\" He made his camel knell down. He got down from his camel, and put his leg on the front legs of the camel and then I rode and sat over it. Safwan set out walking, leading the camel by the rope till we reached the army who had halted to take rest at midday. Then whoever was meant for destruction, fell into destruction, (some people accused me falsely) and the leader of the false accusers was `Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul. After that we returned to Medina, and I became ill for one month while the people were spreading the forged statements of the false accusers. I was feeling during my ailment as if I were not receiving the usual kindness from the Prophet which I used to receive from him when I got sick. But he would come, greet and say, How is that (girl)? I did not know anything of what was going on till I recovered from my ailment and went out with Um Mistah to the Manasi where we used to answer the call of nature, and we used not to go to answer the call of nature except from night to night and that was before we had lavatories near to our houses. And this habit of ours was similar to the habit of the old Arabs in the open country (or away from houses). So. I and Um Mistah bint Ruhm went out walking. Um Mistah stumbled because of her long dress and on that she said, Let Mistah be ruined. I said, You are saying a bad word. Why are you abusing a man who took part in (the battle of) Badr? She said, O Hanata (you there) didnt you hear what they said? Then she told me the rumors of the false accusers. My sickness was aggravated, and when I returned home, Allahs Apostle came to me, and after greeting he said, How is that (girl)? I requested him to allow me to go to my parents. I wanted then to be sure of the news through them I Allahs Apostle allowed me, and I went to my parents and asked my mother, What are the people talking about? She said, O my daughter! Dont worry much about this matter. By Allah, never is there a charming woman loved by her husband who has other wives, but the women would forge false news about her. I said, Glorified be Allah! Are the people really taking of this matter? That night I kept on weeping and could not sleep till morning. In the morning Allahs Apostle called `Ali bin Abu Talib and Usama bin Zaid when he saw the Divine Inspiration delayed, to consul them about divorcing his wife (i.e. `Aisha). Usama bin Zaid said what he knew of the good reputation of his wives and added, O Allahs Apostle! Keep you wife, for, by Allah, we know nothing about her but good. `Ali bin Abu Talib said, O Allahs Apostle! Allah has no imposed restrictions on you, and there are many women other than she, yet you may ask the woman-servant who will tell you the truth. On that Allahs Apostle called Buraira and said, O Burair. Did you ever see anything which roused your suspicions about her? Buraira said, No, by Allah Who has sent you with the Truth, I have never seen in her anything faulty except that she is a girl of immature age, who sometimes sleeps and leaves the dough for the goats to eat. On that day Allahs Apostle ascended the pulpit and requested that somebody support him in punishing `Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul. Allahs Apostle said, Who will support me to punish that person (`Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul) who has hurt me by slandering the reputation of my family? By Allah, I know nothing about my family but good, and they have accused a person about whom I know nothing except good, and he never entered my house except in my company. Sa`d bin Mu`adh got up and said, O Allahs Apostle! by Allah, I will relieve you from him. If that man is from the tribe of the Aus, then we will chop his head off, and if he is from our brothers, the Khazraj, then order us, and we will fulfill your order. On that Sa`d bin Ubada, the chief of the Khazraj and before this incident, he had been a pious man, got up, motivated by his zeal for his tribe and said, By Allah, you have told a lie; you cannot kill him, and you will never be able to kill him. On that Usaid bin Al-Hadir got up and said (to Sa`d bin Ubada), By Allah! you are a liar. By Allah, we will kill him; and you are a hypocrite, defending the hypocrites. On this the two tribes of Aus and Khazraj got excited and were about to fight each other, while Allahs Apostle was standing on the pulpit. He got down and quieted them till they became silent and he kept quiet. On that day I kept on weeping so much so that neither did my tears stop, nor could I sleep. In the morning my parents were with me and I had wept for two nights and a day, till I thought my liver would burst from weeping. While they were sitting with me and I was weeping, an Ansari woman asked my permission to enter, and I allowed her to come in. She sat down and started weeping with me. While we were in this state, Allahs Apostle came and sat down and he had never sat with me since the day they forged the accusation. No revelation regarding my case came to him for a month. He recited Tashah-hud (i.e. None has the right to be worshipped but Allah and Muhammad is His Apostle) and then said, O `Aisha! I have been informed such-and-such about you; if you are innocent, then Allah will soon reveal your innocence, and if you have committed a sin, then repent to Allah and ask Him to forgive you, for when a person confesses his sin and asks Allah for forgiveness, Allah accepts his repentance. When Allahs Apostle finished his speech my tears ceased completely and there remained not even a single drop of it. I requested my father to reply to Allahs Apostle on my behalf. My father said, By Allah, I do not know what to say to Allahs Apostle. I said to my mother, Talk to Allahs Apostle on my behalf. She said, By Allah, I do not know what to say to Allahs Apostle. I was a young girl and did not have much knowledge of the Quran. I said. I know, by Allah, that you have listened to what people are saying and that has been planted in your minds and you have taken it as a truth. Now, if I told you that I am innocent and Allah knows that I am innocent, you would not believe me and if I confessed to you falsely that I am guilty, and Allah knows that I am innocent you would believe me. By Allah, I dont compare my situation with you except to the situation of Josephs father (i.e. Jacob) who said, So (for me) patience is most fitting against that which you assert and it is Allah (Alone) whose help can be sought. Then I turned to the other side of my bed hoping that Allah would prove my innocence. By Allah I never thought that Allah would reveal Divine Inspiration in my case, as I considered myself too inferior to be talked of in the Holy Quran. I had hoped that Allahs Apostle might have a dream in which Allah would prove my innocence. By Allah, Allahs Apostle had not got up and nobody had left the house before the Divine Inspiration came to Allahs Apostle. So, there overtook him the same state which used to overtake him, (when he used to have, on being inspired divinely). He was sweating so much so that the drops of the sweat were dropping like pearls though it was a (cold) wintry day. When that state of Allahs Apostle was over, he was smiling and the first word he said, `Aisha! Thank Allah, for Allah has declared your innocence. My mother told me to go to Allahs Apostle . I replied, By Allah I will not go to him and will not thank but Allah. So Allah revealed: \"Verily! They who spread the slander are a gang among you . . .\" (24.11) When Allah gave the declaration of my Innocence, Abu Bakr, who used to provide for Mistah bin Uthatha for he was his relative, said, By Allah, I will never provide Mistah with anything because of what he said about Aisha. But Allah later revealed: -- \"And let not those who are good and wealthy among you swear not to help their kinsmen, those in need and those who left their homes in Allahs Cause. Let them forgive and overlook. Do you not wish that Allah should forgive you? Verily! Allah is Oft-forgiving, Most Merciful.\" (24.22) After that Abu Bakr said, Yes ! By Allah! I like that Allah should forgive me, and resumed helping Mistah whom he used to help before. Allahs Apostle also asked Zainab bint Jahsh (i.e. the Prophets wife about me saying, What do you know and what did you see? She replied, O Allahs Apostle! I refrain to claim hearing or seeing what I have not heard or seen. By Allah, I know nothing except goodness about Aisha.\" Aisha further added \"Zainab was competing with me (in her beauty and the Prophets love), yet Allah protected her (from being malicious), for she had piety.\"<D>Narrated Qatadah bin An-Numan:\"There was a household among us called Banu Ubairiq, among whom was a Bishr, a Bushair, and a Mubashshir. Bushair was a hypocrite who would recite poetry reviling the Companions of the Prophet () then he would attribute it to some of the Arabs. Then he would say: So-and-so said this and that [So-and-so said this and that]. So when the Companions of the Prophet () would hear that poetry, they would say: By Allah! No one but this filthy person said this poetry - or as the man said - and they would say: Ibn Al-Ubairiq said it.\" He said: \"They were a poor and needy household during Jahiliyyah and Islam. The only food the people of Al-Madinah had was dates and barely. When a man was able to, he would import flour from Ash-Sham which he bought and kept for himself. As for his dependants, their only food was dates and barely. So an import arrived from Ash-Sham, and my uncle Rifaah bin Zaid bought a load of it, which he put in a storage area he had, where he kept his weapons - his shield and his sword. But it was taken from him from under the house. The storage was broken into and and the food and weapons were taken. In the morning, my uncle Rifaah came to me and said: O my nephew! We were robbed during the night, our storage was broken into, and our food and weapons are gone.\" He said: \"They overheard us in the house, and questioned us, and someone said to us, We saw Banu Ubairiq cooking during the night, and it looked like they had some of your food.\" He said: \"Banu Ubairiq were saying - while we were questioning them amidst their dwellings - By Allah! We do not think the one you are looking for is other than Labid bin Sahl, a man among us who is righteous and accepted Islam. When Labid heard that, he brandished his sword and said: I stole? By Allah! You either prove this theft, or I take to you with this sword. They said: Leave us O man! You are not the one who has it. So we continued questioning in the dwellings until we had no doubt that they had taken it. So my uncle said to me: O my nephew! You should go to the Messenger of Allah () and tell him about that.\" Qatadah said: \"So I went to the Messenger of Allah () and said: A family among us are ill-mannered, and they conspired against my uncle Rifaah bin aid. They broken into his storage and took his weapons and his food. We want them to return our weapons, but we have no need for the food. So the Prophet () said: I will decide about that. So when Banu Ubairiq heard about that, they brought a man from among them named Usair bin Urwah to talk to him about that, and some people form their houses gathered and said: O Messenger of Allah! Qatadah bin An-Numan and his uncle came came to a family among us who are a people of Islam and righteousness, accusing them of stealing without proof or confirmation.\" Qatadah said: \"I went to the Messenger of Allah () and spoke to him, and he said: You went to a family among them known for their Islam and righteousness, and accused them of stealing without confirmation or proof.\" He said: \"So I returned wishing that I had lost some of my wealth, and that the Messenger of Allah () had not been spoke to about that. My uncle Rifaah came to me and said: O my nephew! What did you do? So I told him what the Messenger of Allah () said to me, so he said: It is from Allah, Whom we seek help. It was not long before the Quran was revealed: Surely, We have sent down to you the Book in truth, that you might judge between men by that which Allah has shown you, so be not a pelader for the treacherous. That is Banu Ubairiq. And seek forgiveness from Allah. [That is] from what you said to Qatadah. Certainly Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful. And argue not on behalf of those who deceive themselves. Verily, Allah does not like anyone who is a betrayer, sinner. They may hide from men, but they cannot hide from Allah for He is with them up to His saying: Most Merciful. That is: If you seek Allahs forgiveness then He will forgive you. And whoever earns sin, he earns it only against himself... up to His saying: A manifest sin. Their saying about Labid; Had it not been for the grace of Allah and His Mercy upon you... up to His saying: We shall give him a great reward. (4:105-115)\" So when the Quran was revealed, the Messenger of Allah () brought the weapon and returned it to Rifaah. Qatadah said: \"When the weapon was brought to my uncle - and he was an elderly man with bad sight\" or \"an elderly weak man\" - Abu Eisa was in doubt - \"in Jahiliyyah, and I thought that he merely had entered into Islam (without real sincerity) but when I brought it to him, he said: O my nephew! It is for Allahs cause. So I knew that his Islam was genuine. When the Quran was revealed, Bushair went with the idolaters, staying with Sulafah bint Sad bin Sumayyah. So Allah, Most High, revealed: Whoever contradicts and opposes the Messenger after the right path has been shown clearly to him, and follows other than the believers way, We shall keep him in the path he has chosen, and burn him in Hell - what an evil destination. Verily Allah forgives not associating others with Him, but He forgives what is less than that for whomever He wills. And whoever associates others with Allah, then he has indeed strayed away (4:115-116). \"When he went to stay with Sulafah, Hassan bin Thabit lampooned her with verses of poetry. So she took his saddle, put it on her head, then she left with it to cast into the valley. Then she said: You gave me the poetry of Hassan - you did not bring me any good.\"<D>Narrated Ibn `Abbas:When Abu Dhar received the news of the Advent of the Prophet he said to his brother, \"Ride to this valley (of Mecca) and try to find out the truth of the person who claims to be a prophet who is informed of the news of Heaven. Listen to what he says and come back to me.\" So his brother set out and came to the Prophet and listened to some of his talks, and returned to Abu Dhar and said to him. \"I have seen him enjoining virtuous behavior and saying something that is not poetry.\" Abu Dhar said, \"You have not satisfied me as to what I wanted.\" He then took his journey-food and carried a waterskin of his, containing some water till be reached Mecca. He went to the Mosque and searched for the Prophet and though he did not know him, he hated to ask anybody about him. When a part of the night had passed away, `Ali saw him and knew that he was a stranger. So when Abu Dhar saw `Ali, he followed him, and none of them asked his companion about anything, and when it was dawn, Abu Dhar took his journey food and his water-skin to the Mosque and stayed there all the day long without being perceived by the Prophet, and when it was evening, he came back to his retiring place. `Ali passed by him and said, \"Has the man not known his dwelling place yet?\" So `Ali awakened him and took him with him and none of them spoke to the other about anything. When it was the third day. `Ali did the same and Abu Dhar stayed with him. Then `Ali said \"Will you tell me what has brought you here?\" Abu Dhar said, \"If you give me a firm promise that you will guide me, then I will tell you.\" `Ali promised him, and he informed `Ali about the matter. `Ali said, \"It is true, and he is the Apostle of Allah. Next morning when you get up, accompany me, and if I see any danger for you, I will stop as if to pass water, but if I go on, follow me and enter the place which I will enter.\" Abu Dhar did so, and followed `Ali till he entered the place of the Prophet, and Abu Dhar went in with him, Abu Dhar listened to some of the Prophets talks and embraced Islam on the spot. The Prophet said to him, \"Go back to your people and inform them (about it) till you receive my order.\" Abu Dhar said, \"By Him in Whose Hand my life is, I will proclaim my conversion loudly amongst them (i.e. the pagans).\" So he went out, and when he reached the Mosque, he said as loudly as possible, \"I bear witness that None has the right to be worshipped except Allah, and Muhammad is the Apostle of Allah.\" The People got up and beat him painfully. Then Al-Abbas came and knelt over him ((to protect him) and said (to the people), \"Woe to you! Dont you know that this man belongs to the tribe of Ghifar and your trade to Sham is through their way?\" So he rescued him from them. Abu Dhar again did the same the next day. They beat him and took vengeance on him and again Al-Abbas knelt over him (to protect him).<D>Allah then mentions the dispute of the Jews and Christians and the question which they put to the Prophet (pbuh) regarding who really follows the religion of Abraham. When the Prophet (pbuh) told them that they were both far from the Religion of Abraham, they said that they did not accept this judgement. Hence, Allah said: (Seek they) with you (other than the religion of Allah) Islam (complete surrender to Allah), (when unto Him submiteth) acknowledges Islam and Allahs divine Oneness (whosoever is in the heavens) of angels(and the earth) of believers, (willingly) the dwellers of the heavens willingly, (or unwillingly) the dwellers ofthe earth unwillingly. It is also said that this means: the sincere among the believers acknowledge this willingly while the hypocrites do so unwillingly; it is also said this means: those who are born Muslim acknowledge this willingly while those who were made to embrace Islam do so unwillingly, (and unto Him they will be returned) after death.<D>(Wait they) i.e. the people of Mecca, (indeed, for nothing less than that the angels should come unto them) to take their souls away at the moment of death, (or thy Lord should come) on the Day of Judgement, and His coming is without modality, (or there should come one of the portents from thy Lord) i.e. the rising of the sun from the West? (In the day when one of the portents from they Lord cometh) before the rising of the sun from the West, (its belief availeth naught a soul which theretofore) before the rising of the sun from the West (believed not, nor in its belief earned good) nor was it sincere in its belief, nor doing any good works before the rising of the sun from the West. This is because no faith, works or repentance areaccepted from an unbeliever who embraces Islam upon seeing the sun rise from the West, unless thatperson is young at that time or is born after. In such a case, if he leaves Islam after the sun rises from the West and then returns to Islam, his repentance is accepted. Likewise, the repentance of a sinning believer who repents of his sins after the sun rises from the West is accepted. (Say) O Muhammad to the people of Mecca: (Wait you) the Day of Judgement! (Lo! We (too) are waiting) for your punishment on the Day of Judgement or before the Day of Judgement; it is also said that this means: Say, O Muhammad, wait for my destruction, I am also waiting for yours.<D>(And a generation hath succeeded them) a generation of people succeeded the righteous ones, but their successors, among the Jews, were evil (who inherited the Scriptures) they took the Scripture and concealed the traits and description of Muhammad (pbuh) that is in it. (They grasp the goods of this low life (as the price of evil doing)) they take bribes and other unlawful stuff of this world in exchange for concealing the traits and description of Muhammad (pbuh) (and say: It will be forgiven us) the sins we commit at night shall be forgiven during the day, and the sins we commit in the day shall be forgiven at night. (And if there came to them (again)) today (the offer of the like) similar to the unlawful that had come to them before, (they would accept it) and declaring to be lawful. (Hath not the covenant of the Scripture been taken on their behalf that they should not speak aught concerning Allah save the Truth? And they have studied that which is therein) of the traits and attributes of Muhammad (pbuh); it is also said that this means: they studied what is in it of the lawful and the unlawful but did not act upon it. (And the abode of the Hereafter) i.e. Paradise (is better, for those who ward off (evil)) ward off disbelief, idolatry, indecencies, bribery and changing the traits and description of the Prophet (pbuh) in the Torah. Warding off these is better than the abode of the life of this world. (Have ye then no sense?) do you not realise that the life of this world is vanishing and the Hereafter is everlasting?", "Generated_Answer": "A: The question you've been asked is quite nuanced and touches upon a complex aspect of Islamic jurisprudence and history. To address it properly, let's first break down the key elements involved: the Islamic approach to prohibiting alcohol and regulating slavery.\n\n1. **Prohibition of Alcohol**: Alcohol was prohibited in Islam through a gradual process. Initially, Muslims were not forbidden to drink alcohol. It wasn't until several years after the hijra (migration to Medina) that verses were revealed prohibiting its consumption. The process was gradual:\n   - First, Muslims were informed that alcohol and gambling had both benefits and harms but were predominantly harmful (Qur'an 2:219).\n   - Later, they were instructed not to approach prayer while intoxicated (Qur'an 4:43).\n   - Finally, a complete prohibition was established, stating that alcohol, like gambling, is an abomination of Satan's handiwork, and Muslims were commanded to abstain from it entirely (Qur'an 5:90-91).\n\n2. **Regulation of Slavery**: Slavery was a widespread practice in pre-Islamic Arabia. Islam did not immediately abolish it, as it was deeply ingrained in the societal fabric. Instead, it introduced regulations to mitigate its harshness and encouraged the freeing of slaves as a virtuous act:\n   - Islam emphasized the humane treatment of slaves, considering their liberation as a means of expiation for certain sins and encouraging it as an act of charity.\n   - The Qur'an and Hadiths contain numerous references to the freeing of slaves, suggesting it as a meritorious act (e.g., Qur'an 90:13, 58:3).\n\n### Understanding the Difference in Approach\n\nThe different approaches to prohibiting alcohol and regulating slavery stem from the socio-historical context and the nature of these practices.\n\n- **Alcohol**: The consumption of alcohol was not essential to the societal or economic structure of 7th-century Arabia. While it was a common practice, its prohibition did not disrupt the economic or social order significantly. The gradual prohibition allowed for a change in societal attitudes and behaviors.\n\n- **Slavery**: Slavery, on the other hand, was deeply entrenched in the economic and social fabric. It was not feasible to abolish it abruptly, as it would have caused significant social and economic upheaval. Islam's approach was to gradually change attitudes towards slavery by making the freeing of slaves a virtuous act and by regulating the treatment of slaves to mitigate their suffering.\n\n### Addressing"}

As for the Bahirah, it was the norm that if a she-camel delivered on its fifth birthing a male camel, the latter would be immolated and both men and women would eat from it, but if it were a female, they would cleave its ear. The latter is called a Bahirah. The latters milk and benefits were for men only, to the exclusion of women, and when she died both men and women could share her meat. As for the Saibah, people used to give whatever they were willing to give of cattle and hand it over to the custodians of idols. The latter would offer it to travellers who passed by, the men not the women. The animals offered were also male and never female. When thesedied both men and women shared its meat. As for the Wasilah, when a sheep had delivered seven times, they used to check the seventh birth. If it were male, they used to immolate it and its meat was shared by men and women. If it were female, women would not be allowed to benefit from it until the animal died. When the animal died, both men and women shared its meat. If it were a twin delivery, male and female, both were spared for the benefit of men only, until their death. When the animal died, both men and women shared their meat. As for the Ham, it is the male camel whose offspring has produced its own offspring, it is said that such an animal has protected its back. This animal is left alone: it is not used forriding or transporting things. It cannot be stopped from drinking of any water or grazing in any pasture, norcan it be stopped from copulating with any she-camel that comes its way. When this animal gets too old or dies, its meat is shared by men and women.

The primary concern regarding the permissibility (halaal or haraam) of using alcohol-based hand sanitizers hinges on the type of alcohol used and the context of its application.\n\n1. **Type of Alcohol**: Most hand sanitizers contain ethyl alcohol (ethanol), which is the same type of alcohol found in alcoholic beverages. The Islamic ruling on using products containing ethyl alcohol varies among scholars. Some consider it permissible if used for a legitimate purpose (like hygiene) and not for intoxication. Others may have stricter criteria.\n\n2. **Context of Use**: The intention behind using hand sanitizer is typically for cleanliness and hygiene, not for intoxication. This context is crucial in Islamic jurisprudence.\n\n3. **Scholarly Views**: \n   - Some Islamic scholars and organizations have issued rulings that alcohol-based hand sanitizers are permissible for use, especially during times of health crises or when alternatives are not available. They argue that the alcohol is not consumed in the manner that leads to intoxication, and the primary purpose is not to intoxicate but to maintain hygiene.\n   - Others may advise against using such products if alternatives are available, based on the precautionary principle.\n\n**What to Do**:\n\n1. **Continue with Regular Hygiene Practices**: Continue using the hand sanitizer if you need to, especially if there are no alcohol-free alternatives available. The intention is to maintain hygiene.\n\n2. **Look for Alternatives**: If available and feasible, opt for alcohol-free hand sanitizers. Many products now are designed to be alcohol-free, using alternative antimicrobial agents.\n\n3. **Perform Ritual Washing (Wudhu/Ghusl) as Usual**: For prayer, perform your wudhu or ghusl as you normally would. The use of alcohol-based hand sanitizers does not directly impact your ritual purity unless the sanitizer is wet and on your hands when you perform wudhu, in which case you should ensure your hands are washed properly as part of wudhu.\n\n4. **Seek Scholarly Advice**: If you're deeply concerned, consult with a knowledgeable Islamic scholar or organization. They can provide guidance based on your specific situation and the prevailing circumstances.\n\n5. **Repentance is Not Necessary for Unknowing Actions**: In Islam, actions are judged based on the intention. Since you used the hand sanitizer unknowingly, there's no sin attached to it. If you're concerned about the permissibility"}
{"Question": "I have heard that its okay to consume any type of food containing wine, if the food has been boiled for a good amount of time, so that the wine evaporates. Is this permissible? ? --T--", "Answer": "In the name of Allah, Most Compassionate, Most Merciful Although conventional wisdom suggests that alcohol burns off after cooking, that does not hold true in most cases. The following is a chart prepared by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA): Alcohol Burn-off Chart Preparation MethodPercent Retained alcohol added to boiling liquid & removed from heat 85% alcohol flamed 75% no heat, stored overnight 70% baked, 25 minutes, alcohol not stirred into mixture 45% Baked/simmered dishes with alcohol stirred into mixture: 15 minutes cooking time 40% 30 minutes cooking time 35% 1 hour cooking time 25% 1.5 hours cooking time 20% 2 hours cooking time 10% 2.5 hours cooking time 5% (http://homecooking.about.com/library/archive/blalcohol12.htm) Since it is evident that at least some percentage of wine would still be retained in the food after cooking, eating the food in question would be forbidden. Jabir ibn `Abdullah (RA) reports: The Prophet (may Allahs peace and mercy be upon him) said: whatever intoxicates in a large quantity, a small quantity of it is forbidden. (Abu Dawood; similar tradition reported in Nasai) All four Sunni schools are unanimous on the prohibition of consuming wine in any quantity. As well, wine is a type of najasa (filth). With reference to wine, the classical Arabic Hanafi fiqh text Al-Hidayah states: It is filthsevere filth, similar to urine. (Al-Hidayah, Book of Drinks) As a result, the mixture would become filthy as soon as the wine is added to it. Hence, even if the wine were to evaporate after extensive boiling or cooking, it would make no difference. Deriving benefit from filth is forbidden. (Al-Hidayah, Book of Drinks) Therefore, consuming any food or mixture in which wine has been added is forbidden, regardless of how little of it is present in the finished product.

However, the extent to which the alcohol evaporates depends on several factors, including the cooking method, duration, and temperature.\n\n## Step 3: Considering Islamic rulings on consuming wine\nIn Islamic jurisprudence, wine (or any intoxicant) is considered haram (forbidden) for consumption. The question then arises whether cooking or boiling wine-containing food renders it halal (permissible) due to the evaporation of alcohol.\n\n## Step 4: Evaluating the Islamic perspective on alcohol evaporation\nIslamic scholars have discussed the issue of alcohol evaporation during cooking. Some argue that if the alcohol content is significantly reduced or eliminated through cooking, the food might be considered permissible. However, others emphasize that the original substance was wine, which is haram, and thus, the food remains haram regardless of the cooking process.\n\n## Step 5: Reviewing the majority Islamic scholarly opinion\nThe majority of Islamic scholars agree that even if wine is cooked or boiled, the resulting product is still considered haram if it originated from wine. The key factor is not just the presence or absence of alcohol but the origin of the substance.\n\n## Step 6: Applying the scholarly opinion to the given scenario\nGiven that the food in question contains wine and has been boiled, the critical issue is whether the boiling process changes its halal status. According to the majority view, the origin of the substance (wine) being haram is a decisive factor.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{No}$"}
{"Question": "Q: I went to the toilet and I saw an impurity on the shower with which we do istinja.

You tried to avoid the impurity, but your hand came into contact with it.

If your slippers or feet came into contact with the impurity or impure water and were not properly cleaned, they could be considered impure.\n\n- **Uncertainty**: There's significant uncertainty in your actions and their outcomes, particularly regarding whether the water you poured reached and cleaned the base of your slippers and whether you stepped on the impure water drops.\n\n- **Precautionary Principle**: Islamic jurisprudence often applies the precautionary principle in cases of uncertainty regarding purity. This principle suggests that if there's a likelihood of impurity, one should take steps to ensure purification.\n\n### Analysis\n\n1. **Did you spread impurity?** The likelihood of spreading impurity depends on whether your slippers or feet came into contact with impure water or the impurity itself and whether that was subsequently cleaned.\n\n2. **The water you poured on your feet**: If the water reached the base of your slippers, it could be considered that you took a step towards purification. However, the effectiveness of this action depends on whether the water was enough to wash away any Najasah.\n\n3. **Stepping on the water"}

During a Ghazwa of his, he drew lots amongst us and the lot fell upon me, and I proceeded with him after Allah had decreed the use of the veil by women. I was carried in a Howdah (on the camel) and dismounted while still in it. When Allahs Apostle was through with his Ghazwa and returned home, and we approached the city of Medina, Allahs Apostle ordered us to proceed at night. When the order of setting off was given, I walked till I was past the army to answer the call of nature. After finishing I returned (to the camp) to depart (with the others) and suddenly realized that my necklace over my chest was missing. So, I returned to look for it and was delayed because of that. The people who used to carry me on the camel, came to my Howdah and put it on the back of the camel, thinking that I was in it, as, at that time, women were light in weight, and thin and lean, and did not use to eat much. So, those people did not feel the difference in the heaviness of the Howdah while lifting it, and they put it over the camel. At that time I was a young lady. They set the camel moving and proceeded on. I found my necklace after the army had gone, and came to their camp to find nobody. So, I went to the place where I used to stay, thinking that they would discover my absence and come back in my search. While in that state, I felt sleepy and slept. Safwan bin Muattal As-Sulami Adh-Dhakwani was behind the army and reached my abode in the morning. When he saw a sleeping person, he came to me, and he used to see me before veiling. So, I got up when I heard him saying, \"Inna lil-lah-wa inn a ilaihi rajiun (We are for Allah, and we will return to Him).\" He made his camel knell down. He got down from his camel, and put his leg on the front legs of the camel and then I rode and sat over it. Safwan set out walking, leading the camel by the rope till we reached the army who had halted to take rest at midday. Then whoever was meant for destruction, fell into destruction, (some people accused me falsely) and the leader of the false accusers was `Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul. After that we returned to Medina, and I became ill for one month while the people were spreading the forged statements of the false accusers. I was feeling during my ailment as if I were not receiving the usual kindness from the Prophet which I used to receive from him when I got sick. But he would come, greet and say, How is that (girl)? I did not know anything of what was going on till I recovered from my ailment and went out with Um Mistah to the Manasi where we used to answer the call of nature, and we used not to go to answer the call of nature except from night to night and that was before we had lavatories near to our houses. And this habit of ours was similar to the habit of the old Arabs in the open country (or away from houses). So. I and Um Mistah bint Ruhm went out walking. Um Mistah stumbled because of her long dress and on that she said, Let Mistah be ruined. I said, You are saying a bad word. Why are you abusing a man who took part in (the battle of) Badr? She said, O Hanata (you there) didnt you hear what they said? Then she told me the rumors of the false accusers. My sickness was aggravated, and when I returned home, Allahs Apostle came to me, and after greeting he said, How is that (girl)? I requested him to allow me to go to my parents. I wanted then to be sure of the news through them I Allahs Apostle allowed me, and I went to my parents and asked my mother, What are the people talking about? She said, O my daughter! Dont worry much about this matter. By Allah, never is there a charming woman loved by her husband who has other wives, but the women would forge false news about her. I said, Glorified be Allah! Are the people really taking of this matter? That night I kept on weeping and could not sleep till morning. In the morning Allahs Apostle called `Ali bin Abu Talib and Usama bin Zaid when he saw the Divine Inspiration delayed, to consul them about divorcing his wife (i.e. `Aisha). Usama bin Zaid said what he knew of the good reputation of his wives and added, O Allahs Apostle! Keep you wife, for, by Allah, we know nothing about her but good. `Ali bin Abu Talib said, O Allahs Apostle! Allah has no imposed restrictions on you, and there are many women other than she, yet you may ask the woman-servant who will tell you the truth. On that Allahs Apostle called Buraira and said, O Burair. Did you ever see anything which roused your suspicions about her? Buraira said, No, by Allah Who has sent you with the Truth, I have never seen in her anything faulty except that she is a girl of immature age, who sometimes sleeps and leaves the dough for the goats to eat. On that day Allahs Apostle ascended the pulpit and requested that somebody support him in punishing `Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul. Allahs Apostle said, Who will support me to punish that person (`Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul) who has hurt me by slandering the reputation of my family? By Allah, I know nothing about my family but good, and they have accused a person about whom I know nothing except good, and he never entered my house except in my company. Sa`d bin Mu`adh got up and said, O Allahs Apostle! by Allah, I will relieve you from him. If that man is from the tribe of the Aus, then we will chop his head off, and if he is from our brothers, the Khazraj, then order us, and we will fulfill your order. On that Sa`d bin Ubada, the chief of the Khazraj and before this incident, he had been a pious man, got up, motivated by his zeal for his tribe and said, By Allah, you have told a lie; you cannot kill him, and you will never be able to kill him. On that Usaid bin Al-Hadir got up and said (to Sa`d bin Ubada), By Allah! you are a liar. By Allah, we will kill him; and you are a hypocrite, defending the hypocrites. On this the two tribes of Aus and Khazraj got excited and were about to fight each other, while Allahs Apostle was standing on the pulpit. He got down and quieted them till they became silent and he kept quiet. On that day I kept on weeping so much so that neither did my tears stop, nor could I sleep. In the morning my parents were with me and I had wept for two nights and a day, till I thought my liver would burst from weeping. While they were sitting with me and I was weeping, an Ansari woman asked my permission to enter, and I allowed her to come in. She sat down and started weeping with me. While we were in this state, Allahs Apostle came and sat down and he had never sat with me since the day they forged the accusation. No revelation regarding my case came to him for a month. He recited Tashah-hud (i.e. None has the right to be worshipped but Allah and Muhammad is His Apostle) and then said, O `Aisha! I have been informed such-and-such about you; if you are innocent, then Allah will soon reveal your innocence, and if you have committed a sin, then repent to Allah and ask Him to forgive you, for when a person confesses his sin and asks Allah for forgiveness, Allah accepts his repentance. When Allahs Apostle finished his speech my tears ceased completely and there remained not even a single drop of it. I requested my father to reply to Allahs Apostle on my behalf. My father said, By Allah, I do not know what to say to Allahs Apostle. I said to my mother, Talk to Allahs Apostle on my behalf. She said, By Allah, I do not know what to say to Allahs Apostle. I was a young girl and did not have much knowledge of the Quran. I said. I know, by Allah, that you have listened to what people are saying and that has been planted in your minds and you have taken it as a truth. Now, if I told you that I am innocent and Allah knows that I am innocent, you would not believe me and if I confessed to you falsely that I am guilty, and Allah knows that I am innocent you would believe me. By Allah, I dont compare my situation with you except to the situation of Josephs father (i.e. Jacob) who said, So (for me) patience is most fitting against that which you assert and it is Allah (Alone) whose help can be sought. Then I turned to the other side of my bed hoping that Allah would prove my innocence. By Allah I never thought that Allah would reveal Divine Inspiration in my case, as I considered myself too inferior to be talked of in the Holy Quran. I had hoped that Allahs Apostle might have a dream in which Allah would prove my innocence. By Allah, Allahs Apostle had not got up and nobody had left the house before the Divine Inspiration came to Allahs Apostle. So, there overtook him the same state which used to overtake him, (when he used to have, on being inspired divinely). He was sweating so much so that the drops of the sweat were dropping like pearls though it was a (cold) wintry day. When that state of Allahs Apostle was over, he was smiling and the first word he said, `Aisha! Thank Allah, for Allah has declared your innocence. My mother told me to go to Allahs Apostle . I replied, By Allah I will not go to him and will not thank but Allah. So Allah revealed: \"Verily! They who spread the slander are a gang among you . . .\" (24.11) When Allah gave the declaration of my Innocence, Abu Bakr, who used to provide for Mistah bin Uthatha for he was his relative, said, By Allah, I will never provide Mistah with anything because of what he said about Aisha. But Allah later revealed: -- \"And let not those who are good and wealthy among you swear not to help their kinsmen, those in need and those who left their homes in Allahs Cause. Let them forgive and overlook. Do you not wish that Allah should forgive you? Verily! Allah is Oft-forgiving, Most Merciful.\" (24.22) After that Abu Bakr said, Yes ! By Allah! I like that Allah should forgive me, and resumed helping Mistah whom he used to help before. Allahs Apostle also asked Zainab bint Jahsh (i.e. the Prophets wife about me saying, What do you know and what did you see? She replied, O Allahs Apostle! I refrain to claim hearing or seeing what I have not heard or seen. By Allah, I know nothing except goodness about Aisha.\" Aisha further added \"Zainab was competing with me (in her beauty and the Prophets love), yet Allah protected her (from being malicious), for she had piety.\"<D>Narrated Aisha:(The wife of the Prophet) Whenever Allahs Apostle intended to go on a journey, he used to draw lots among his wives and would take with him the one on whom the lot had fallen. Once he drew lots when he wanted to carry out a Ghazwa, and the lot came upon me. So I proceeded with Allahs Apostle after Allahs order of veiling (the women) had been revealed and thus I was carried in my howdah (on a camel) and dismounted while still in it. We carried on our journey, and when Allahs Apostle had finished his Ghazwa and returned and we approached Medina, Allahs Apostle ordered to proceed at night. When the army was ordered to resume the homeward journey, I got up and walked on till I left the army (camp) behind. When I had answered the call of nature, I went towards my howdah, but behold ! A necklace of mine made of Jaz Azfar (a kind of black bead) was broken and I looked for it and my search for it detained me. The group of people who used to carry me, came and carried my howdah on to the back of my camel on which I was riding, considering that I was therein. At that time women were light in weight and were not fleshy for they used to eat little (food), so those people did not feel the lightness of the howdah while raising it up, and I was still a young lady. They drove away the camel and proceeded. Then I found my necklace after the army had gone. I came to their camp but found nobody therein so I went to the place where I used to stay, thinking that they would miss me and come back in my search. While I was sitting at my place, I felt sleepy and slept. Safwan bin Al-Muattil As-Sulami Adh- Dhakw-ani was behind the army. He had started in the last part of the night and reached my stationing place in the morning and saw the figure of a sleeping person. He came to me and recognized me on seeing me for he used to see me before veiling. I got up because of his saying: \"Inna Li l-lahi wa inna ilaihi rajiun,\" which he uttered on recognizing me. I covered my face with my garment, and by Allah, he did not say to me a single word except, \"Inna Li l-lahi wa inna ilaihi rajiun,\" till he made his shecamel kneel down whereupon he trod on its forelegs and I mounted it. Then Safwan set out, leading the she-camel that was carrying me, till we met the army while they were resting during the hot midday. Then whoever was meant for destruction, fell in destruction, and the leader of the Ifk (forged statement) was `Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul. After this we arrived at Medina and I became ill for one month while the people were spreading the forged statements of the people of the Ifk, and I was not aware of anything thereof. But what aroused my doubt while I was sick, was that I was no longer receiving from Allahs Apostle the same kindness as I used to receive when I fell sick. Allahs Apostle would enter upon me, say a greeting and add, \"How is that (lady)?\" and then depart. That aroused my suspicion but I was not aware of the propagated evil till I recovered from my ailment. I went out with Um Mistah to answer the call of nature towards Al-Manasi, the place where we used to relieve ourselves, and used not to go out for this purpose except from night to night, and that was before we had lavatories close to our houses. And this habit of ours was similar to the habit of the old Arabs (in the deserts or in the tents) concerning the evacuation of the bowels, for we considered it troublesome and harmful to take lavatories in the houses. So I went out with Um Mistah who was the daughter of Abi Ruhm bin `Abd Manaf, and her mother was daughter of Sakhr bin Amir who was the aunt of Abi Bakr As-Siddiq, and her son was Mistah bin Uthatha. When we had finished our affair, Um Mistah and I came back towards my house. Um Mistah stumbled over her robe whereupon she said, \"Let Mistah be ruined ! \" I said to her, \"What a bad word you have said! Do you abuse a man who has taken part in the Battle of Badr? She said, \"O you there! Didnt you hear what he has said?\" I said, \"And what did he say?\" She then told me the statement of the people of the Ifk (forged statement) which added to my ailment. When I returned home, Allahs Apostle came to me, and after greeting, he said, \"How is that (lady)?\" I said, \"Will you allow me to go to my parents?\" At that time I intended to be sure of the news through them. Allahs Apostle allowed me and I went to my parents and asked my mother, \"O my mother! What are the people talking about?\" My mother said, \"O my daughter! Take it easy, for by Allah, there is no charming lady who is loved by her husband who has other wives as well, but that those wives would find fault with her.\" I said, \"Subhan Allah! Did the people really talk about that?\" That night I kept on weeping the whole night till the morning. My tears never stopped, nor did I sleep, and morning broke while I was still weeping, Allahs Apostle called `Ali bin Abi Talib and Usama bin Zaid when the Divine Inspiration delayed, in order to consult them as to the idea of divorcing his wife. Usama bin Zaid told Allahs Apostle of what he knew about the innocence of his wife and of his affection he kept for her. He said, \"O Allahs Apostle! She is your wife, and we do not know anything about her except good.\" But `Ali bin Abi Talib said, \"O Allahs Apostle! Allah does not impose restrictions on you; and there are plenty of women other than her. If you however, ask (her) slave girl, she will tell you the truth.\" `Aisha added: So Allahs Apostle called for Barira and said, \"O Barira! Did you ever see anything which might have aroused your suspicion? (as regards Aisha). Barira said, \"By Allah Who has sent you with the truth, I have never seen anything regarding Aisha which I would blame her for except that she is a girl of immature age who sometimes sleeps and leaves the dough of her family unprotected so that the domestic goats come and eat it.\" So Allahs Apostle got up (and addressed) the people an asked for somebody who would take revenge on `Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul then. Allahs Apostle, while on the pulpit, said, \"O Muslims! Who will help me against a man who has hurt me by slandering my family? By Allah, I know nothing except good about my family, and people have blamed a man of whom I know nothing except good, and he never used to visit my family except with me,\" Sa`d bin Mu`adh Al-Ansari got up and said, \"O Allahs Apostle! By Allah, I will relieve you from him. If he be from the tribe of (Bani) Al-Aus, then I will chop his head off; and if he be from our brethren, the Khazraj, then you give us your order and we will obey it.\" On that, Sa`d bin Ubada got up, and he was the chief of the Khazraj, and before this incident he had been a pious man but he was incited by his zeal for his tribe. He said to Sa`d (bin Mu`adh), \"By Allah the Eternal, you have told a lie! You shall not kill him and you will never be able to kill him!\" On that, Usaid bin Hudair, the cousin of Sa`d (bin Mu`adh) got up and said to Sa`d bin Ubada, \"You are a liar! By Allah the Eternal, we will surely kill him; and you are a hypocrite defending the hypocrites!\" So the two tribes of Al-Aus and Al-Khazraj got excited till they were on the point of fighting with each other while Allahs Apostle was standing on the pulpit. Allahs Apostle continued quietening them till they became silent whereupon he became silent too. On that day I kept on weeping so much that neither did my tears stop, nor could I sleep. In the morning my parents were with me, and I had wept for two nights and a day without sleeping and with incessant tears till they thought that my liver would burst with weeping. While they were with me and I was weeping, an Ansari woman asked permission to see me. I admitted her and she sat and started weeping with me. While I was in that state, Allahs Apostle came to us, greeted, and sat down,. He had never sat with me since the day what was said, was said. He had stayed a month without receiving any Divine Inspiration concerning my case. Allahs Apostle recited the Tashahhud after he had sat down, and then said, \"Thereafter, O `Aisha! I have been informed such and-such a thing about you; and if you are innocent, Allah will reveal your innocence, and if you have committed a sin, then ask for Allahs forgiveness and repent to Him, for when a slave confesses his sin and then repents to Allah, Allah accepts his repentance.\" When Allahs Apostle had finished his speech, my tears ceased completely so that I no longer felt even a drop thereof. Then I said to my father, \"Reply to Allahs Apostle on my behalf as to what he said.\" He said, \"By Allah, I do not know what to say to Allahs Apostle.\" Then I said to my mother, \"Reply to Allahs Apostle.\" She said, \"I do not know what to say to Allahs Apostle.\" Still a young girl as I was and though I had little knowledge of Quran, I said, \"By Allah, I know that you heard this story (of the Ifk) so much so that it has been planted in your minds and you have believed it. So now, if I tell you that I am innocent, and Allah knows that I am innocent, you will not believe me; and if I confess something, and Allah knows that I am innocent of it, you will believe me. By Allah, I cannot find of you an example except that of Josephs father: \"So (for me) patience is most fitting against that which you assert and it is Allah (Alone) Whose help can be sought. Then I turned away and lay on my bed, and at that time I knew that I was innocent and that Allah would reveal my innocence. But by Allah, I never thought that Allah would sent down about my affair, Divine Inspiration that would be recited (forever), as I considered myself too unworthy to be talked of by Allah with something that was to be recited: but I hoped that Allahs Apostle might have a vision in which Allah would prove my innocence. By Allah, Allahs Apostle had not left his seat and nobody had left the house when the Divine Inspiration came to Allahs Apostle . So there overtook him the same hard condition which used to overtake him (when he was Divinely Inspired) so that the drops of his sweat were running down, like pearls, though it was a (cold) winter day, and that was because of the heaviness of the Statement which was revealed to him. When that state of Allahs Apostle was over, and he was smiling when he was relieved, the first word he said was, \"Aisha, Allah has declared your innocence.\" My mother said to me, \"Get up and go to him.\" I said, \"By Allah, I will not go to him and I will not thank anybody but Allah.\" So Allah revealed: \"Verily! They who spread the Slander are a gang among you. Think it not....\" (24.11-20). When Allah revealed this to confirm my innocence, Abu Bakr As-Siddiq who used to provide for Mistah bin Uthatha because of the latters kinship to him and his poverty, said, \"By Allah, I will never provide for Mistah anything after what he has said about Aisha\". So Allah revealed: (continued...) (continuing... 1): -6.274:... ... \"Let not those among you who are good and are wealthy swear not to give (help) to their kinsmen, those in need, and those who have left their homes for Allahs Cause. Let them Pardon and forgive (i.e. do not punish them). Do you not love that should forgive you? Verily Allah is Oft-forgiving. Most Merciful.\" (24.22) Abu Bakr said, \"Yes, by Allah, I wish that Allah should forgive me.\" So he resumed giving Mistah the aid he used to give him before and said, \"By Allah, I will never withold it from him at all.\" Aisha further said: Allahs Apostle also asked Zainab bint Jahsh about my case. He said, \"O Zainab! What have you seen?\" She replied, \"O Allahs Apostle! I protect my hearing and my sight (by refraining from telling lies). I know nothing but good (about Aisha).\" Of all the wives of Allahs Apostle, it was Zainab who aspired to receive from him the same favor as I used to receive, yet, Allah saved her (from telling lies) because of her piety. But her sister, Hamna, kept on fighting on her behalf so she was destroyed as were those who invented and spread the slander.<D>Narrated Ibn `Abbas:The first lady to use a girdle was the mother of Ishmael. She used a girdle so that she might hide her tracks from Sarah. Abraham brought her and her son Ishmael while she was suckling him, to a place near the Ka`ba under a tree on the spot of Zamzam, at the highest place in the mosque. During those days there was nobody in Mecca, nor was there any water So he made them sit over there and placed near them a leather bag containing some dates, and a small water-skin containing some water, and set out homeward. Ishmaels mother followed him saying, \"O Abraham! Where are you going, leaving us in this valley where there is no person whose company we may enjoy, nor is there anything (to enjoy)?\" She repeated that to him many times, but he did not look back at her Then she asked him, \"Has Allah ordered you to do so?\" He said, \"Yes.\" She said, \"Then He will not neglect us,\" and returned while Abraham proceeded onwards, and on reaching the Thaniya where they could not see him, he faced the Ka`ba, and raising both hands, invoked Allah saying the following prayers: O our Lord! I have made some of my offspring dwell in a valley without cultivation, by Your Sacred House (Ka`ba at Mecca) in order, O our Lord, that they may offer prayer perfectly. So fill some hearts among men with love towards them, and (O Allah) provide them with fruits, so that they may give thanks. (14.37) Ishmaels mother went on suckling Ishmael and drinking from the water (she had). When the water in the water-skin had all been used up, she became thirsty and her child also became thirsty. She started looking at him (i.e. Ishmael) tossing in agony; She left him, for she could not endure looking at him, and found that the mountain of Safa was the nearest mountain to her on that land. She stood on it and started looking at the valley keenly so that she might see somebody, but she could not see anybody. Then she descended from Safa and when she reached the valley, she tucked up her robe and ran in the valley like a person in distress and trouble, till she crossed the valley and reached the Marwa mountain where she stood and started looking, expecting to see somebody, but she could not see anybody. She repeated that (running between Safa and Marwa) seven times.\" The Prophet said, \"This is the source of the tradition of the walking of people between them (i.e. Safa and Marwa). When she reached the Marwa (for the last time) she heard a voice and she asked herself to be quiet and listened attentively. She heard the voice again and said, O, (whoever you may be)! You have made me hear your voice; have you got something to help me?\" And behold! She saw an angel at the place of Zamzam, digging the earth with his heel (or his wing), till water flowed from that place. She started to make something like a basin around it, using her hand in this way, and started filling her water-skin with water with her hands, and the water was flowing out after she had scooped some of it.\" The Prophet added, \"May Allah bestow Mercy on Ishmaels mother! Had she let the Zamzam (flow without trying to control it) (or had she not scooped from that water) (to fill her water-skin), Zamzam would have been a stream flowing on the surface of the earth.\" The Prophet further added, \"Then she drank (water) and suckled her child. The angel said to her, Dont be afraid of being neglected, for this is the House of Allah which will be built by this boy and his father, and Allah never neglects His people. The House (i.e. Ka`ba) at that time was on a high place resembling a hillock, and when torrents came, they flowed to its right and left. She lived in that way till some people from the tribe of Jurhum or a family from Jurhum passed by her and her child, as they (i.e. the Jurhum people) were coming through the way of Kada. They landed in the lower part of Mecca where they saw a bird that had the habit of flying around water and not leaving it. They said, This bird must be flying around water, though we know that there is no water in this valley. They sent one or two messengers who discovered the source of water, and returned to inform them of the water. So, they all came (towards the water).\" The Prophet added, \"Ishmaels mother was sitting near the water. They asked her, Do you allow us to stay with you?\" She replied, Yes, but you will have no right to possess the water. They agreed to that.\" The Prophet further said, \"Ishmaels mother was pleased with the whole situation as she used to love to enjoy the company of the people. So, they settled there, and later on they sent for their families who came and settled with them so that some families became permanent residents there. The child (i.e. Ishmael) grew up and learnt Arabic from them and (his virtues) caused them to love and admire him as he grew up, and when he reached the age of puberty they made him marry a woman from amongst them. After Ishmaels mother had died, Abraham came after Ishmaels marriage in order to see his family that he had left before, but he did not find Ishmael there. When he asked Ishmaels wife about him, she replied, He has gone in search of our livelihood. Then he asked her about their way of living and their condition, and she replied, We are living in misery; we are living in hardship and destitution, complaining to him. He said, When your husband returns, convey my salutation to him and tell him to change the threshold of the gate (of his house). When Ishmael came, he seemed to have felt something unusual, so he asked his wife, Has anyone visited you? She replied, Yes, an old man of so-and-so description came and asked me about you and I informed him, and he asked about our state of living, and I told him that we were living in a hardship and poverty. On that Ishmael said, Did he advise you anything? She replied, Yes, he told me to convey his salutation to you and to tell you to change the threshold of your gate. Ishmael said, It was my father, and he has ordered me to divorce you. Go back to your family. So, Ishmael divorced her and married another woman from amongst them (i.e. Jurhum). Then Abraham stayed away from them for a period as long as Allah wished and called on them again but did not find Ishmael. So he came to Ishmaels wife and asked her about Ishmael. She said, He has gone in search of our livelihood. Abraham asked her, How are you getting on? asking her about their sustenance and living. She replied, We are prosperous and well-off (i.e. we have everything in abundance). Then she thanked Allah Abraham said, What kind of food do you eat? She said. Meat. He said, What do you drink? She said, Water.\" He said, \"O Allah! Bless their meat and water.\" The Prophet added, \"At that time they did not have grain, and if they had grain, he would have also invoked Allah to bless it.\" The Prophet added, \"If somebody has only these two things as his sustenance, his health and disposition will be badly affected, unless he lives in Mecca.\" The Prophet added,\" Then Abraham said Ishmaels wife, \"When your husband comes, give my regards to him and tell him that he should keep firm the threshold of his gate. When Ishmael came back, he asked his wife, Did anyone call on you? She replied, Yes, a good-looking old man came to me, so she praised him and added. He asked about you, and I informed him, and he asked about our livelihood and I told him that we were in a good condition. Ishmael asked her, Did he give you any piece of advice? She said, Yes, he told me to give his regards to you and ordered that you should keep firm the threshold of your gate. On that Ishmael said, It was my father, and you are the threshold (of the gate). He has ordered me to keep you with me. Then Abraham stayed away from them for a period as long as Allah wished, and called on them afterwards. He saw Ishmael under a tree near Zamzam, sharpening his arrows. When he saw Abraham, he rose up to welcome him (and they greeted each other as a father does with his son or a son does with his father). Abraham said, O Ishmael! Allah has given me an order. Ishmael said, Do what your Lord has ordered you to do. Abraham asked, Will you help me? Ishmael said, I will help you. Abraham said, Allah has ordered me to build a house here, pointing to a hillock higher than the land surrounding it.\" The Prophet added, \"Then they raised the foundations of the House (i.e. the Ka`ba). Ishmael brought the stones and Abraham was building, and when the walls became high, Ishmael brought this stone and put it for Abraham who stood over it and carried on building, while Ishmael was handing him the stones, and both of them were saying, O our Lord! Accept (this service) from us, Verily, You are the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing. The Prophet added, \"Then both of them went on building and going round the Ka`ba saying: O our Lord ! Accept (this service) from us, Verily, You are the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing.\" (2.127)<D>Allah then went back to His saying: (Divorce must be pronounced twice) saying: (And if he hath divorced her) i.e. the third time, (then she is not lawful unto him thereafter) after the third divorce (until she hath wedded another husband) and the marriage must be consummated. (Then if he (the other husband) divorce her) this was revealed about Abd al-Rahman Ibn al-Zubayr, (it is no sin for both of them) the first husband and the woman (that they come together again) with a new dowry and marriage contract (if they consider) if they know (that they are able to observe the limits of Allah) the rulings of Allah regulating the relationship between husband and wife. (These are the limits of Allah) these are Allahs rulings andobligations. (He manifesteth them for people who have knowledge) they are from Allah and believe them tobe so. <D>(Divorce must be pronounced twice) He says: the divorce in which a man is entitled to take back his wife is pronounced once on two separate occasions (and then (a woman) must be retained) before she is pronounced divorced a third time and before performing major ritual ablution from the third menstruation (in honour) with kind companionship and intercourse (or released in kindness) or divorced a third time with such kindness as restores her rights. (And it is not lawful for you that ye take from women aught of that which ye have given them) of dowry; (except (in the case) when both arbiters) when the husband and wifeboth know that she wants to ransom her divorce (fear that they may not be able to keep the limits (imposed by) Allah) the rulings of Allah regulating the relationship between husband and wife. (And if ye fear) if you know (that they may not be able to keep the limits (imposed by) Allah) the rulings of Allah regulating the relationship between husband and wife, (in that case it is no sin for either of them) and especially the husband (if the woman ransom herself) if the husband takes what the woman ransoms herself with, out of the generosity of her soul. This verse was revealed about Thabit Ibn Qays Ibn Shammas whose wife Jamilah was the daughter of Abdullah Ibn Ubayy Ibn Salul, chief of the hypocrites. This woman ransomed her divorce from her husband by giving him back what he gave her as dowry. (These are the limits of Allah) the rulings of Allah regulating the relationship between husband and wife, (Transgress them not) do not step beyond that which Allah has prohibited. (For whoso transgresseth Allahs limits) steps beyond them: (such are wrong-doers) harmful to themselves.<D>(And the wife of Pharaoh) Asiyah Bint Muzahim, who was Moses aunt (said: (He will be)) this child will be (a consolation for me and for you) O Pharaoh. (Kill him not. Peradventure he may be of use to us) in our farm, (or we may choose him for a son) or adopt him as a son. (And they perceived not) the Children of Israel did not know that he was not from them; it is also said that this means: and they did not know that their destruction will be at his hands.", "Generated_Answer": "I'm so sorry to hear that you're going through this.

{"Question": "Q: This evening, I was in a shop about to pay for my shopping, when a woman, who seemed to be off her head, came into the shop and began talking away incoherently with the shopkeeper and myself. She seemed to be on drugs or drunk or something. She had some shopping gathered, and about to pay for it. Amongst her shopping, she had some beer cans (alcohol). As she was talking to me, she kept on touching the back of my left hand with her index finger every now and then, so as to get me to sort of agree with her on what she was going on about, and also as a way of making a point. It was harmless, but I felt uncomfortable. But just after she had paid for her stuff, one of her beer cans fell out of her bag on the ground, and I picked it up and gave it to her. That was it. I know one shouldnt deal with alcohol in any way, but I went ahead and picked the beer can up (knowing alcohol is haram) for her and handed it to her! Is there any sin on me due to this? And what is the ruling on this sort of thing, i.e helping someone pick up their beer cans/bottles after they had dropped it on the floor? What can I do to make up for this if anything? How about the woman tapping me on the back of my hand, as a way of emphasising her, incoherent points? What should I do in this case? ? --T--", "Answer": "1. You should make tawbah for picking up the beer can and giving it to her and refrain from this in the future. 2. Allowing her to touch you was incorrect and impermissible. You should have immediately stopped her from touching you. You should make istighfaar for what has happened. And Allah Taala ( ) knows best", "Document": "Ubadah b. Walid b. Samit reported:I and my father set out in search of knowledge to a tribe of the Ansar before their death (i. e. before the Companions of the Holy Prophet left the world) and I was the first to meet Abu Yasar, a Companion of Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) and there was a young man with him who carried the record of letters with him and there was a mantle prepared by the tribe of Maafiri upon him. And his servant too had a Maafiri mantle over him. My father said to him: My uncle, I see the signs of anger or that of agony on your face. He said: Yes, such and such person, the son of so and so, of the tribe of Harami owed me a debt. I went to his family, extended salutations and said: Where is he? They said: He is not here. Then came out to me his son who was at the threshold of his youth. I said to him: Where is your father? He said: No sooner did he hear your sound than he hid himself behind my mothers bedstead. I said to him: Walk out to me, for I know where you are. He came out. I said to him: What prompted you to hide yourself from me? He said: By God, whatever I would say to you would not be a lie. By Allah, I fear that I should tell a lie to you and in case of making promise with you I should break it, as you are the Companion of Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him). The fact is that I was hard up in regard to money. I said: Do you adjure by Allah? He said: I adjure by Allah. I said: Do you adjure by Allah? He said: I adjure by Allah. I said: Do you adjure by Allah? He said: I adjure by Allah. Then he brought his promissory note and he wrote off (the debt) with his hand and said: Make payment when you find yourself solvent enough to pay me back; if you are not, then there is no liability upon you. These two eyes of mine saw, and he (AbuI-Yasar) placed his fingers upon his eyes and these two ears of mine heard and my heart retained, and he pointed towards his heart that Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: He who gives time to one who is financially hard up (in the payment of debt) or writes off his debt, Allah will provide him His shadow. I said to him: My uncle, if you get the cloak of your servant and you give him your two clothes, or take his two clothes of Maafir and give him your cloak, then there would be one dress for you and one for him. He wiped my head and said: O Allah, bless the son of my brother. O, son of my brother, these two very eyes of mine saw and these two ears of mine listened to and this heart of mine retained this, and he pointed towards the heart that Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: Feed them (the servants) and clothe them (the servants) what you wear, and if I give him the goods of the world, it is easy for me than this that he should take my virtues on the Day of Resurrection. We went on till we came to Jabir b. Abdullah in the mosque and he was busy in observing prayer in one cloth which he had joined at its opposite ends. I made my way through the people till I sat between him and the Qibla and I said: May Allah have mercy upon you. Do you observe prayer with one cloth on your body whereas your mantle is lying at your side? He pointed me with his hand towards my breast just like this and he separated his fingers and bent them in the shape of a bow. And (he said): I thought that a fool like you should come to me so that he should see me as I do and he should then also do like it. Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) came to us in this very mosque and he had in his hand the twig of the palm-tree and he saw mucus towards the Qibla of the mosque and he erased it with the help of the twig. He then came to us and said: Who amongst you likes that Allah should turn His face away from him? We were afraid. He then again said: Who amongst you likes that Allah should turn His face away from him? We were afraid. He again said: Who amongst you likes that Allah should turn His face away from him? We said: Allahs Messenger, none of us likes it. And he said: If one amongst you stands for prayer, Allah, the Exalted and Glorious, is before him he should not spit in front of him, or on his right side, but should spit on his left side beneath his left foot and if he is impelled to do so all of a sudden (in spite of himself) he should then spit in his cloth and fold it in some part of it. (and he further said: ) Bring some sweet-smelling thing. A young man who belonged to our tribe stood up, went and brought scent in his palm. Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) took that and applied it to the end of that twig and then touched the place where there had been mucus. Jabir said: This is why you should apply scent to your mosques. It is reported on the same authority: We set out along with Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) on an expedition of Batn Buwat. He (the Holy Prophet) was in search of al-Majdi b. Amr al-Juhani. (We had so meagre equipment) that five. six or seven of us had one camel to ride and so we mounted it turn by turn. Once there wan. the turn of an Ansari to ride upon the camel. He made it kneel down to ride over it (and after having. mounted it), he tried to raise it up but it hesitated. So he said. May there be curse of Allah upon you! Thereupon Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: Who is there to curse his camel? He said: Allahs Messenger, it is I. Thereupon he said: Get down from the camel and let us not have in our company the cursed one. Dont curse your own selves, nor your children. nor your belongings. There is the possibility that your curse may synchronies with the time when Allah is about to confer upon you what you demand and thus your prayer may be readily responded. It is reported on the same authority: We set out on an expedition along with Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) until it was evening, and we had been near a. water reservoir of Arabia. Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: Who would be the person who would go ahead and set right the reservoir and drink water himself and serve us with it? Jabir said: I stood up and said: Allahs Messenger, it is I who am ready to do that. Thereupon Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: Who is the person to accompany Jabir? And then Jabbar b. Sakhr stood up. So we went to that well and poured in that tank a bucket or two of water and plastered it with clay and then began to fill it (with water) until it was filled to the brim. Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) was the first who appeared before us, and he said: Do you (both) permit me to drink water out of it? We said: Yea, Allahs Messenger. He led his camel to drink water and it drank. He then pulled its rein and it stretched its legs and began to urinate. He then took it aside and made it kneel down at another place and then came to the tank and performed ablution. I then got up and performed ablution like the ablution of Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him), and Jabbar b. Sakhr went in order to relieve himself and Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) got up to observe prayer and there was a mantle over me. I tried to invert its ends but it was too short (to cover my body easily). It had its borders. I then inverted it (the mantle) and drew its opposite ends and then tied them at my neck. I then came and stood upon the left side of Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him). He caught hold of me and made me go round behind him, until he made me stand on his right side. Then Jabbar b. Sakhr came. He performed ablution and then came and stood on the left side of Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him). Then Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) caught hold of our hands together, pushed us back and made us stand behind him. Then Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) began to look upon me with darting looks, but I did not perceive that. After that I became aware of it and he pointed with the gesture of his hand that I should wrap my loin-cloth. When Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) had finished the prayer, he said: Jabir! I said: Allahs Messenger, at thy beck and call. He said: When the cloth around you is inadequate, then tie the opposite ends but when it is small, tie it over the lower body. Jabir reported: We set out on an expedition with Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) and the only means of sustenance for every person amongst us was only one date for a day and we used to chew it. And we struck the leaves with the help of our bow and ate them until the sides of our mouths were injured. It so happened one day that a person was overlooked and not given a date. We carried that person and bore witness to the fact that he had not been given that date so he was offered that and he got up and received that. Jabir reported: We set out on an expedition along with Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) until we got down at a spacious valley and Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) went to relieve himself. I followed him with a bucket full of water and Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) looked about and he found no privacy but two trees at the end of the valley and Allahs Messenger (may. peace be upon him) went to one of them and took hold of one of its twigs and said: Be thou under my control by the permission of Allah, and so it came under his control like the camel who has its nosestring in the hand of its rider, and then he came to the second tree and took hold of a twig and said: Be thou under my control with the permission of Allah, and it came under his control, and when he came in the middle of the two trees he joined together the two twigs and said: join with the permission of Allah. Jabir said: I was afraid lest Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) should be aware of my nearness and go still farther. And Muhammad b. Abbad has used the word\" faitabd\" and I began to talk to myself. And as I saw, I suddenly found Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) before me and the two trees were separated and each one of them was standing at its place. I saw Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) standing for a short time, nodding his head towards right and left. Ismail pointed towards the right and left with the help of his head (in order to demonstrate how the Holy Prophet had pointed). Then he (the Holy Prophet) came to me and said: Jabir did you see my place where I was standing? I said: Allahs Messenger, yes. He then said: Then you should go to those two trees and cut a twig from each of them and go to that place with them where I was standing and stand there where I was standing and place a twig on the right and a twig on the left. Jabir said: I set out and took hold of a stone and broke it and sharpened it and then I came to those trees and cut a twig from each one of them. I then came dragging them until I stood at the place where Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) had been standing and placed a twig on the right and a twig on the left. Then I met him and said: Allahs Messenger, I have done that, but (kindly) explain to me the reason for it. Thereupon he said: I passed by two graves the occupants of which had been undergoing torment. I liked to make intercession for them so that the might be relieved of this torment y as long as these twigs remain fresh. Jabir said: We came back to the (camp of the) army and Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: Jabir, call people for per- forming wudu. I cried: Come and perform wudu, come and perform wudu, come and perform wudu. I said: Allahs Messenger, there is not even a drop of water in the army camp, and there. was a person who used to cool the water for Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) in the old water-skin which kept hanging by the twig. He asked me to go to such and such Ansari and ask him to see if there was any water in that skin. I went to him and cast a glance in it but did not find anything but a drop in the mouth of that water-skin and if I were to draw that, the water-skins,. dried part would suck it up. I came to Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) and said: Allahs Messenger, I have not found anything in it but a drop of water in the mouth of the water-skin and now if I were to draw that, it would be absorbed. He said: Go and bring that to me. I brought that to him. He took hold of it -and began to utter something which I could not understand and then pressed it with his hand and gave that to me and said: Jabir, announce for the tub to be brought. So I announced that the tub of the army (be brought). It was brought accordingly and I placed it before him (the Holy Prophet). Thereupon Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) placed his hands in the tub like this: with his fingers stretched out, and then he placed his fingers at the bottom of the tub and said: Jabir, take it (that waters-skin) and pour water over me, by reciting Bismillah, and I poured water and I said: Bismillah, and found water sprouting out between the fingers of Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him). Then that tub gushed forth until it was filled up and the Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: Jabir, make an announcement to the effect: He who needs water should take that. Jabir said: The people came and got water until they were all satiated. I said: Is there anyone left who wants to get it? And Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) then lifted up his hand from that tub and it was still full. Then the people made a complaint to Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) about hunger and he said: May Allah provide you food! We came to the bank of the ocean and the ocean was tossing and it threw out a big animal and we lit fire and cooked it and took it until we had eaten to our hearts content. Jabir said: I and such and such five persons entered Its socket and nobody could see us until we had come out, and we took hold of one of its ribs and twisted it into a sort of arch, then we called the tallest of the persons of the army and the hugest of the camels of the army and it had the big saddle over it, and it could easily pass through it without the rider having need to bend down.<D>Musab b. Sad reported on the authority of his father that many verses of the Quran had been revealed in connection with him. His mother Umm Sad had taken oath that she would never talk with him until he abandoned his faith and she neither ate nor drank and said:Allah has commanded you to treat well your parents and I am your mother and I command you to do this. She passed three days in this state until she fainted because of extreme hunger and at that time her son whose name was Umara stood up and served her drink and she began to curse Sad that Allah, the Exalted and Glorions, revealed these verses of the Holy Quran:\" And We have enjoined upon a person goodness to his parents but if they contend with thee to associate (others) with Me of which you have no knowledge, then obey them not\" (xxix. 8) ; Treat thein with customary good in this world\" (xxxi. 15). He also reported that there fell to the lot of Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) huge spoils of war and there was one sword in them. I picked that up and came to Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) and said: Bestow this sword upon me (as my share in the spoils of war) and you know my state. Thereupon he said: Return it to the place from where you picked it up. I went back until I decided to throw it in a store but my soul repulsed me so I came back and asked him to give that sword to me. He said in a loud voice to return it to the place from where I had picked it up. It was on this occasion that this verse was revealed:\" They asked about the spoils of war\" (viii. 1). He further said: I once fell ill and sent a message to Allahs Apostle (may peace be upon him). He visited me and I said to him: Permit me to distribute (in charity) my property as much as I like. He did not agree. I said: (Permit me to distribute) half of it. He did not agree. I said: (Permit me to distribute) the third part, whereupon he kept quiet and it was after this (that the distribution of ones property in charity) to the extent of one-third was held valid. He further said: I came to a group of persons of the Ansir and Muhajirin and they said: Come, so that we may serve you wine, and it was before the use of wine had been prohibited. I went to them in a garden and there had been with them the roasted head of a camel and a small water-skin containing wine. I ate and drank along with them and there came under discussion the Ansr (Helpers) and Muhajirin (immigrants). I said: The immigrants are better than the Ansar, that a person picked up a portion of the head (of the camel and struck me with it that my nose was injured. I came to Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) and informed him of the situation that Aliah, the Exalted and Glorious, revealed verses pertaining to wine:\" Intoxicants and the games of chance and (sacrificing to) stones set up and (divining by) arrows are only an uncleanliness, the devils work\" (v. 90).<D>Narrated Ibn `Abbas:The first lady to use a girdle was the mother of Ishmael. She used a girdle so that she might hide her tracks from Sarah. Abraham brought her and her son Ishmael while she was suckling him, to a place near the Ka`ba under a tree on the spot of Zamzam, at the highest place in the mosque. During those days there was nobody in Mecca, nor was there any water So he made them sit over there and placed near them a leather bag containing some dates, and a small water-skin containing some water, and set out homeward. Ishmaels mother followed him saying, \"O Abraham! Where are you going, leaving us in this valley where there is no person whose company we may enjoy, nor is there anything (to enjoy)?\" She repeated that to him many times, but he did not look back at her Then she asked him, \"Has Allah ordered you to do so?\" He said, \"Yes.\" She said, \"Then He will not neglect us,\" and returned while Abraham proceeded onwards, and on reaching the Thaniya where they could not see him, he faced the Ka`ba, and raising both hands, invoked Allah saying the following prayers: O our Lord! I have made some of my offspring dwell in a valley without cultivation, by Your Sacred House (Ka`ba at Mecca) in order, O our Lord, that they may offer prayer perfectly. So fill some hearts among men with love towards them, and (O Allah) provide them with fruits, so that they may give thanks. (14.37) Ishmaels mother went on suckling Ishmael and drinking from the water (she had). When the water in the water-skin had all been used up, she became thirsty and her child also became thirsty. She started looking at him (i.e. Ishmael) tossing in agony; She left him, for she could not endure looking at him, and found that the mountain of Safa was the nearest mountain to her on that land. She stood on it and started looking at the valley keenly so that she might see somebody, but she could not see anybody. Then she descended from Safa and when she reached the valley, she tucked up her robe and ran in the valley like a person in distress and trouble, till she crossed the valley and reached the Marwa mountain where she stood and started looking, expecting to see somebody, but she could not see anybody. She repeated that (running between Safa and Marwa) seven times.\" The Prophet said, \"This is the source of the tradition of the walking of people between them (i.e. Safa and Marwa). When she reached the Marwa (for the last time) she heard a voice and she asked herself to be quiet and listened attentively. She heard the voice again and said, O, (whoever you may be)! You have made me hear your voice; have you got something to help me?\" And behold! She saw an angel at the place of Zamzam, digging the earth with his heel (or his wing), till water flowed from that place. She started to make something like a basin around it, using her hand in this way, and started filling her water-skin with water with her hands, and the water was flowing out after she had scooped some of it.\" The Prophet added, \"May Allah bestow Mercy on Ishmaels mother! Had she let the Zamzam (flow without trying to control it) (or had she not scooped from that water) (to fill her water-skin), Zamzam would have been a stream flowing on the surface of the earth.\" The Prophet further added, \"Then she drank (water) and suckled her child. The angel said to her, Dont be afraid of being neglected, for this is the House of Allah which will be built by this boy and his father, and Allah never neglects His people. The House (i.e. Ka`ba) at that time was on a high place resembling a hillock, and when torrents came, they flowed to its right and left. She lived in that way till some people from the tribe of Jurhum or a family from Jurhum passed by her and her child, as they (i.e. the Jurhum people) were coming through the way of Kada. They landed in the lower part of Mecca where they saw a bird that had the habit of flying around water and not leaving it. They said, This bird must be flying around water, though we know that there is no water in this valley. They sent one or two messengers who discovered the source of water, and returned to inform them of the water. So, they all came (towards the water).\" The Prophet added, \"Ishmaels mother was sitting near the water. They asked her, Do you allow us to stay with you?\" She replied, Yes, but you will have no right to possess the water. They agreed to that.\" The Prophet further said, \"Ishmaels mother was pleased with the whole situation as she used to love to enjoy the company of the people. So, they settled there, and later on they sent for their families who came and settled with them so that some families became permanent residents there. The child (i.e. Ishmael) grew up and learnt Arabic from them and (his virtues) caused them to love and admire him as he grew up, and when he reached the age of puberty they made him marry a woman from amongst them. After Ishmaels mother had died, Abraham came after Ishmaels marriage in order to see his family that he had left before, but he did not find Ishmael there. When he asked Ishmaels wife about him, she replied, He has gone in search of our livelihood. Then he asked her about their way of living and their condition, and she replied, We are living in misery; we are living in hardship and destitution, complaining to him. He said, When your husband returns, convey my salutation to him and tell him to change the threshold of the gate (of his house). When Ishmael came, he seemed to have felt something unusual, so he asked his wife, Has anyone visited you? She replied, Yes, an old man of so-and-so description came and asked me about you and I informed him, and he asked about our state of living, and I told him that we were living in a hardship and poverty. On that Ishmael said, Did he advise you anything? She replied, Yes, he told me to convey his salutation to you and to tell you to change the threshold of your gate. Ishmael said, It was my father, and he has ordered me to divorce you. Go back to your family. So, Ishmael divorced her and married another woman from amongst them (i.e. Jurhum). Then Abraham stayed away from them for a period as long as Allah wished and called on them again but did not find Ishmael. So he came to Ishmaels wife and asked her about Ishmael. She said, He has gone in search of our livelihood. Abraham asked her, How are you getting on? asking her about their sustenance and living. She replied, We are prosperous and well-off (i.e. we have everything in abundance). Then she thanked Allah Abraham said, What kind of food do you eat? She said. Meat. He said, What do you drink? She said, Water.\" He said, \"O Allah! Bless their meat and water.\" The Prophet added, \"At that time they did not have grain, and if they had grain, he would have also invoked Allah to bless it.\" The Prophet added, \"If somebody has only these two things as his sustenance, his health and disposition will be badly affected, unless he lives in Mecca.\" The Prophet added,\" Then Abraham said Ishmaels wife, \"When your husband comes, give my regards to him and tell him that he should keep firm the threshold of his gate. When Ishmael came back, he asked his wife, Did anyone call on you? She replied, Yes, a good-looking old man came to me, so she praised him and added. He asked about you, and I informed him, and he asked about our livelihood and I told him that we were in a good condition. Ishmael asked her, Did he give you any piece of advice? She said, Yes, he told me to give his regards to you and ordered that you should keep firm the threshold of your gate. On that Ishmael said, It was my father, and you are the threshold (of the gate). He has ordered me to keep you with me. Then Abraham stayed away from them for a period as long as Allah wished, and called on them afterwards. He saw Ishmael under a tree near Zamzam, sharpening his arrows. When he saw Abraham, he rose up to welcome him (and they greeted each other as a father does with his son or a son does with his father). Abraham said, O Ishmael! Allah has given me an order. Ishmael said, Do what your Lord has ordered you to do. Abraham asked, Will you help me? Ishmael said, I will help you. Abraham said, Allah has ordered me to build a house here, pointing to a hillock higher than the land surrounding it.\" The Prophet added, \"Then they raised the foundations of the House (i.e. the Ka`ba). Ishmael brought the stones and Abraham was building, and when the walls became high, Ishmael brought this stone and put it for Abraham who stood over it and carried on building, while Ishmael was handing him the stones, and both of them were saying, O our Lord! Accept (this service) from us, Verily, You are the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing. The Prophet added, \"Then both of them went on building and going round the Ka`ba saying: O our Lord ! Accept (this service) from us, Verily, You are the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing.\" (2.127)<D>Allah then said to them after He brought them back to life: (And fight in the way of Allah) in obedience of Allah against your enemies, (and know that Allah is Hearer) of what you say, (Knower) of your intentions and the punishment that is going to visit you if you disobey what you have been commanded to do.<D>(Say: O People of the Scripture!

(Allah is not unaware of what ye do) Allah is not oblivious to your disbelief: concealing the Truth and committing transgressions. This verse was revealed about those who invited Ammar [Ibn Yasir] and his fellow Muslims to join their religion: Judaism.<D>Allah then mentions His covenant with the Children of Israel, saying: (And when We made a covenant with the Children of Israel: Worship none save Allah) declare Him as the only true God and do not ascribe any partner to Him, (and be good to parents) be dutiful to them (and to kindred) and keep contact with relatives (and to orphans) and be kind to orphans (and the needy) and generous to the needy, (and speak kindly to mankind) say the Truth regarding Muhammad (pbuh); (and establish prayer) perfect the five daily prayers (and pay the poor-due) and give from your wealth what is due to the poor. (Then, after that, ye slid back) you turned back on this covenant, (save a few of you) from amongst your forefathers; as it is said that this refers to Abdullah Ibn Salam and his companions, (being averse) denying and leaving it aside.

The action of picking up the beer can and giving it back to her is not considered promoting or endorsing the consumption of alcohol. Your action was more out of courtesy and maintaining public decorum. There's a difference between directly handling alcohol for its intended use (which is generally discouraged for Muslims due to its haram status) and a situation like this where the action is more about resolving an immediate, mundane situation.\n\n2. **Ruling on helping someone pick up their beer cans/bottles**:\n   - The ruling can vary based on the context and intention. If your intention is not to assist in the consumption of alcohol but to be courteous or help in a situation where not doing so might cause embarrassment or be seen as unnecessarily confrontational, it is viewed differently. Islamic jurisprudence emphasizes intentions behind actions. The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) said, \"Actions are according to their intentions, and everyone will get what they intended.\" (Bukhari)\n\n3. **Sin and making up for it**:\n   - Given your intention was not to assist in a haram act but rather to be courteous, it's unlikely you've incurred a sin. However, to be cautious, you can reflect on the incident, seek forgiveness if you feel any unease, and continue to be mindful of your actions in similar future situations.\n\n4. **The woman tapping on the back of your hand**:\n   - Physical contact initiated by someone else, especially in a context that is not overtly inappropriate or aggressive, is generally not considered something for which you are directly responsible. You can maintain a polite distance or move your hand away subtly if such contact makes you uncomfortable. In this case, it seemed like she was using it as a way to emphasize her points, not with any ill intent.\n\n5. **What to do**:\n   - In the future, if someone drops an item, you can still help by picking it up, focusing on the act of kindness rather than the nature of the item. If the physical contact makes you uncomfortable, a polite and subtle withdrawal of your hand or a slight step back can help maintain your comfort without escalating the situation.\n\n6. **Seeking Forgiveness**:\n   - If you're still concerned, you can"}

Opt for soft fabrics that won't irritate your scalp or hair.\n3. **Moisture-wicking properties**: Fabrics that wick away moisture can help keep your scalp dry and reduce the risk of fungal or bacterial infections that can contribute to hair loss.\n\nSome recommended fabrics for hijabs that may help reduce hair loss include:\n\n1. **Cotton**: A natural, breathable fabric that's gentle on the hair and scalp.\n2. **Jersey**: A soft, stretchy fabric that's often used for hijabs. Look for cotton or cotton-blend jersey fabrics.\n3. **Bamboo**: A sustainable, moisture-wicking fabric that's gentle on the hair and scalp.\n\nIn addition to choosing the right fabric, here are some tips to help minimize hair loss while wearing the hijab:\n\n1. **Tightness**: Avoid tying your hijab too tightly, as this can cause hair loss due to constant tension on the hair follicles.\n2. **Tying style**: Try to vary your hijab-tying style to avoid putting constant pressure on the same areas of your hair.\n3. **Hair care**: Maintain good hair hygiene, and use gentle hair care products to minimize damage.\n4. **Giving your hair a break**: Take breaks from wearing the hijab when you're at home or in a safe environment to give your hair and scalp a rest.\n\nBy making a few simple changes to your hijab-wearing habits and choosing the right fabrics, you can help reduce hair loss and maintain healthy, beautiful hair.\n\nMay Allah guide you and grant you good health, Ameen.\n\n---"}

How do I make her believe otherwise? ? --T--", "Answer": "Speak to your daughter and family with compassion and love and avoid entering into arguments and quarrels. The more effective way is that you improve the environment of the home. Commence with the following program at home: 1. Recite some portion of the Quran.2.

Make a collective duaa at the end of each session, begging Allah Ta`ala for His special help, mercy and forgiveness for oneself and the rest of the ummah. And Allah Taala ( ) knows best", "Document": "Narrated Ibn `Abbas:The first lady to use a girdle was the mother of Ishmael. She used a girdle so that she might hide her tracks from Sarah. Abraham brought her and her son Ishmael while she was suckling him, to a place near the Ka`ba under a tree on the spot of Zamzam, at the highest place in the mosque. During those days there was nobody in Mecca, nor was there any water So he made them sit over there and placed near them a leather bag containing some dates, and a small water-skin containing some water, and set out homeward. Ishmaels mother followed him saying, \"O Abraham! Where are you going, leaving us in this valley where there is no person whose company we may enjoy, nor is there anything (to enjoy)?\" She repeated that to him many times, but he did not look back at her Then she asked him, \"Has Allah ordered you to do so?\" He said, \"Yes.\" She said, \"Then He will not neglect us,\" and returned while Abraham proceeded onwards, and on reaching the Thaniya where they could not see him, he faced the Ka`ba, and raising both hands, invoked Allah saying the following prayers: O our Lord! I have made some of my offspring dwell in a valley without cultivation, by Your Sacred House (Ka`ba at Mecca) in order, O our Lord, that they may offer prayer perfectly. So fill some hearts among men with love towards them, and (O Allah) provide them with fruits, so that they may give thanks. (14.37) Ishmaels mother went on suckling Ishmael and drinking from the water (she had). When the water in the water-skin had all been used up, she became thirsty and her child also became thirsty. She started looking at him (i.e. Ishmael) tossing in agony; She left him, for she could not endure looking at him, and found that the mountain of Safa was the nearest mountain to her on that land. She stood on it and started looking at the valley keenly so that she might see somebody, but she could not see anybody. Then she descended from Safa and when she reached the valley, she tucked up her robe and ran in the valley like a person in distress and trouble, till she crossed the valley and reached the Marwa mountain where she stood and started looking, expecting to see somebody, but she could not see anybody. She repeated that (running between Safa and Marwa) seven times.\" The Prophet said, \"This is the source of the tradition of the walking of people between them (i.e. Safa and Marwa). When she reached the Marwa (for the last time) she heard a voice and she asked herself to be quiet and listened attentively. She heard the voice again and said, O, (whoever you may be)! You have made me hear your voice; have you got something to help me?\" And behold! She saw an angel at the place of Zamzam, digging the earth with his heel (or his wing), till water flowed from that place. She started to make something like a basin around it, using her hand in this way, and started filling her water-skin with water with her hands, and the water was flowing out after she had scooped some of it.\" The Prophet added, \"May Allah bestow Mercy on Ishmaels mother! Had she let the Zamzam (flow without trying to control it) (or had she not scooped from that water) (to fill her water-skin), Zamzam would have been a stream flowing on the surface of the earth.\" The Prophet further added, \"Then she drank (water) and suckled her child. The angel said to her, Dont be afraid of being neglected, for this is the House of Allah which will be built by this boy and his father, and Allah never neglects His people. The House (i.e. Ka`ba) at that time was on a high place resembling a hillock, and when torrents came, they flowed to its right and left. She lived in that way till some people from the tribe of Jurhum or a family from Jurhum passed by her and her child, as they (i.e. the Jurhum people) were coming through the way of Kada. They landed in the lower part of Mecca where they saw a bird that had the habit of flying around water and not leaving it. They said, This bird must be flying around water, though we know that there is no water in this valley. They sent one or two messengers who discovered the source of water, and returned to inform them of the water. So, they all came (towards the water).\" The Prophet added, \"Ishmaels mother was sitting near the water. They asked her, Do you allow us to stay with you?\" She replied, Yes, but you will have no right to possess the water. They agreed to that.\" The Prophet further said, \"Ishmaels mother was pleased with the whole situation as she used to love to enjoy the company of the people. So, they settled there, and later on they sent for their families who came and settled with them so that some families became permanent residents there. The child (i.e. Ishmael) grew up and learnt Arabic from them and (his virtues) caused them to love and admire him as he grew up, and when he reached the age of puberty they made him marry a woman from amongst them. After Ishmaels mother had died, Abraham came after Ishmaels marriage in order to see his family that he had left before, but he did not find Ishmael there. When he asked Ishmaels wife about him, she replied, He has gone in search of our livelihood. Then he asked her about their way of living and their condition, and she replied, We are living in misery; we are living in hardship and destitution, complaining to him. He said, When your husband returns, convey my salutation to him and tell him to change the threshold of the gate (of his house). When Ishmael came, he seemed to have felt something unusual, so he asked his wife, Has anyone visited you? She replied, Yes, an old man of so-and-so description came and asked me about you and I informed him, and he asked about our state of living, and I told him that we were living in a hardship and poverty. On that Ishmael said, Did he advise you anything? She replied, Yes, he told me to convey his salutation to you and to tell you to change the threshold of your gate. Ishmael said, It was my father, and he has ordered me to divorce you. Go back to your family. So, Ishmael divorced her and married another woman from amongst them (i.e. Jurhum). Then Abraham stayed away from them for a period as long as Allah wished and called on them again but did not find Ishmael. So he came to Ishmaels wife and asked her about Ishmael. She said, He has gone in search of our livelihood. Abraham asked her, How are you getting on? asking her about their sustenance and living. She replied, We are prosperous and well-off (i.e. we have everything in abundance). Then she thanked Allah Abraham said, What kind of food do you eat? She said. Meat. He said, What do you drink? She said, Water.\" He said, \"O Allah! Bless their meat and water.\" The Prophet added, \"At that time they did not have grain, and if they had grain, he would have also invoked Allah to bless it.\" The Prophet added, \"If somebody has only these two things as his sustenance, his health and disposition will be badly affected, unless he lives in Mecca.\" The Prophet added,\" Then Abraham said Ishmaels wife, \"When your husband comes, give my regards to him and tell him that he should keep firm the threshold of his gate. When Ishmael came back, he asked his wife, Did anyone call on you? She replied, Yes, a good-looking old man came to me, so she praised him and added. He asked about you, and I informed him, and he asked about our livelihood and I told him that we were in a good condition. Ishmael asked her, Did he give you any piece of advice? She said, Yes, he told me to give his regards to you and ordered that you should keep firm the threshold of your gate. On that Ishmael said, It was my father, and you are the threshold (of the gate). He has ordered me to keep you with me. Then Abraham stayed away from them for a period as long as Allah wished, and called on them afterwards. He saw Ishmael under a tree near Zamzam, sharpening his arrows. When he saw Abraham, he rose up to welcome him (and they greeted each other as a father does with his son or a son does with his father). Abraham said, O Ishmael! Allah has given me an order. Ishmael said, Do what your Lord has ordered you to do. Abraham asked, Will you help me? Ishmael said, I will help you. Abraham said, Allah has ordered me to build a house here, pointing to a hillock higher than the land surrounding it.\" The Prophet added, \"Then they raised the foundations of the House (i.e. the Ka`ba). Ishmael brought the stones and Abraham was building, and when the walls became high, Ishmael brought this stone and put it for Abraham who stood over it and carried on building, while Ishmael was handing him the stones, and both of them were saying, O our Lord! Accept (this service) from us, Verily, You are the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing. The Prophet added, \"Then both of them went on building and going round the Ka`ba saying: O our Lord ! Accept (this service) from us, Verily, You are the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing.\" (2.127)<D>Narrated Aisha:(The wife of the Prophet) Whenever Allahs Apostle intended to go on a journey, he used to draw lots among his wives and would take with him the one on whom the lot had fallen. Once he drew lots when he wanted to carry out a Ghazwa, and the lot came upon me. So I proceeded with Allahs Apostle after Allahs order of veiling (the women) had been revealed and thus I was carried in my howdah (on a camel) and dismounted while still in it. We carried on our journey, and when Allahs Apostle had finished his Ghazwa and returned and we approached Medina, Allahs Apostle ordered to proceed at night. When the army was ordered to resume the homeward journey, I got up and walked on till I left the army (camp) behind. When I had answered the call of nature, I went towards my howdah, but behold ! A necklace of mine made of Jaz Azfar (a kind of black bead) was broken and I looked for it and my search for it detained me. The group of people who used to carry me, came and carried my howdah on to the back of my camel on which I was riding, considering that I was therein. At that time women were light in weight and were not fleshy for they used to eat little (food), so those people did not feel the lightness of the howdah while raising it up, and I was still a young lady. They drove away the camel and proceeded. Then I found my necklace after the army had gone. I came to their camp but found nobody therein so I went to the place where I used to stay, thinking that they would miss me and come back in my search. While I was sitting at my place, I felt sleepy and slept. Safwan bin Al-Muattil As-Sulami Adh- Dhakw-ani was behind the army. He had started in the last part of the night and reached my stationing place in the morning and saw the figure of a sleeping person. He came to me and recognized me on seeing me for he used to see me before veiling. I got up because of his saying: \"Inna Li l-lahi wa inna ilaihi rajiun,\" which he uttered on recognizing me. I covered my face with my garment, and by Allah, he did not say to me a single word except, \"Inna Li l-lahi wa inna ilaihi rajiun,\" till he made his shecamel kneel down whereupon he trod on its forelegs and I mounted it. Then Safwan set out, leading the she-camel that was carrying me, till we met the army while they were resting during the hot midday. Then whoever was meant for destruction, fell in destruction, and the leader of the Ifk (forged statement) was `Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul. After this we arrived at Medina and I became ill for one month while the people were spreading the forged statements of the people of the Ifk, and I was not aware of anything thereof. But what aroused my doubt while I was sick, was that I was no longer receiving from Allahs Apostle the same kindness as I used to receive when I fell sick. Allahs Apostle would enter upon me, say a greeting and add, \"How is that (lady)?\" and then depart. That aroused my suspicion but I was not aware of the propagated evil till I recovered from my ailment. I went out with Um Mistah to answer the call of nature towards Al-Manasi, the place where we used to relieve ourselves, and used not to go out for this purpose except from night to night, and that was before we had lavatories close to our houses. And this habit of ours was similar to the habit of the old Arabs (in the deserts or in the tents) concerning the evacuation of the bowels, for we considered it troublesome and harmful to take lavatories in the houses. So I went out with Um Mistah who was the daughter of Abi Ruhm bin `Abd Manaf, and her mother was daughter of Sakhr bin Amir who was the aunt of Abi Bakr As-Siddiq, and her son was Mistah bin Uthatha. When we had finished our affair, Um Mistah and I came back towards my house. Um Mistah stumbled over her robe whereupon she said, \"Let Mistah be ruined ! \" I said to her, \"What a bad word you have said! Do you abuse a man who has taken part in the Battle of Badr? She said, \"O you there! Didnt you hear what he has said?\" I said, \"And what did he say?\" She then told me the statement of the people of the Ifk (forged statement) which added to my ailment. When I returned home, Allahs Apostle came to me, and after greeting, he said, \"How is that (lady)?\" I said, \"Will you allow me to go to my parents?\" At that time I intended to be sure of the news through them. Allahs Apostle allowed me and I went to my parents and asked my mother, \"O my mother! What are the people talking about?\" My mother said, \"O my daughter! Take it easy, for by Allah, there is no charming lady who is loved by her husband who has other wives as well, but that those wives would find fault with her.\" I said, \"Subhan Allah! Did the people really talk about that?\" That night I kept on weeping the whole night till the morning. My tears never stopped, nor did I sleep, and morning broke while I was still weeping, Allahs Apostle called `Ali bin Abi Talib and Usama bin Zaid when the Divine Inspiration delayed, in order to consult them as to the idea of divorcing his wife. Usama bin Zaid told Allahs Apostle of what he knew about the innocence of his wife and of his affection he kept for her. He said, \"O Allahs Apostle! She is your wife, and we do not know anything about her except good.\" But `Ali bin Abi Talib said, \"O Allahs Apostle! Allah does not impose restrictions on you; and there are plenty of women other than her. If you however, ask (her) slave girl, she will tell you the truth.\" `Aisha added: So Allahs Apostle called for Barira and said, \"O Barira! Did you ever see anything which might have aroused your suspicion? (as regards Aisha). Barira said, \"By Allah Who has sent you with the truth, I have never seen anything regarding Aisha which I would blame her for except that she is a girl of immature age who sometimes sleeps and leaves the dough of her family unprotected so that the domestic goats come and eat it.\" So Allahs Apostle got up (and addressed) the people an asked for somebody who would take revenge on `Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul then. Allahs Apostle, while on the pulpit, said, \"O Muslims! Who will help me against a man who has hurt me by slandering my family? By Allah, I know nothing except good about my family, and people have blamed a man of whom I know nothing except good, and he never used to visit my family except with me,\" Sa`d bin Mu`adh Al-Ansari got up and said, \"O Allahs Apostle! By Allah, I will relieve you from him. If he be from the tribe of (Bani) Al-Aus, then I will chop his head off; and if he be from our brethren, the Khazraj, then you give us your order and we will obey it.\" On that, Sa`d bin Ubada got up, and he was the chief of the Khazraj, and before this incident he had been a pious man but he was incited by his zeal for his tribe. He said to Sa`d (bin Mu`adh), \"By Allah the Eternal, you have told a lie! You shall not kill him and you will never be able to kill him!\" On that, Usaid bin Hudair, the cousin of Sa`d (bin Mu`adh) got up and said to Sa`d bin Ubada, \"You are a liar! By Allah the Eternal, we will surely kill him; and you are a hypocrite defending the hypocrites!\" So the two tribes of Al-Aus and Al-Khazraj got excited till they were on the point of fighting with each other while Allahs Apostle was standing on the pulpit. Allahs Apostle continued quietening them till they became silent whereupon he became silent too. On that day I kept on weeping so much that neither did my tears stop, nor could I sleep. In the morning my parents were with me, and I had wept for two nights and a day without sleeping and with incessant tears till they thought that my liver would burst with weeping. While they were with me and I was weeping, an Ansari woman asked permission to see me. I admitted her and she sat and started weeping with me. While I was in that state, Allahs Apostle came to us, greeted, and sat down,. He had never sat with me since the day what was said, was said. He had stayed a month without receiving any Divine Inspiration concerning my case. Allahs Apostle recited the Tashahhud after he had sat down, and then said, \"Thereafter, O `Aisha! I have been informed such and-such a thing about you; and if you are innocent, Allah will reveal your innocence, and if you have committed a sin, then ask for Allahs forgiveness and repent to Him, for when a slave confesses his sin and then repents to Allah, Allah accepts his repentance.\" When Allahs Apostle had finished his speech, my tears ceased completely so that I no longer felt even a drop thereof. Then I said to my father, \"Reply to Allahs Apostle on my behalf as to what he said.\" He said, \"By Allah, I do not know what to say to Allahs Apostle.\" Then I said to my mother, \"Reply to Allahs Apostle.\" She said, \"I do not know what to say to Allahs Apostle.\" Still a young girl as I was and though I had little knowledge of Quran, I said, \"By Allah, I know that you heard this story (of the Ifk) so much so that it has been planted in your minds and you have believed it. So now, if I tell you that I am innocent, and Allah knows that I am innocent, you will not believe me; and if I confess something, and Allah knows that I am innocent of it, you will believe me. By Allah, I cannot find of you an example except that of Josephs father: \"So (for me) patience is most fitting against that which you assert and it is Allah (Alone) Whose help can be sought. Then I turned away and lay on my bed, and at that time I knew that I was innocent and that Allah would reveal my innocence. But by Allah, I never thought that Allah would sent down about my affair, Divine Inspiration that would be recited (forever), as I considered myself too unworthy to be talked of by Allah with something that was to be recited: but I hoped that Allahs Apostle might have a vision in which Allah would prove my innocence. By Allah, Allahs Apostle had not left his seat and nobody had left the house when the Divine Inspiration came to Allahs Apostle . So there overtook him the same hard condition which used to overtake him (when he was Divinely Inspired) so that the drops of his sweat were running down, like pearls, though it was a (cold) winter day, and that was because of the heaviness of the Statement which was revealed to him. When that state of Allahs Apostle was over, and he was smiling when he was relieved, the first word he said was, \"Aisha, Allah has declared your innocence.\" My mother said to me, \"Get up and go to him.\" I said, \"By Allah, I will not go to him and I will not thank anybody but Allah.\" So Allah revealed: \"Verily! They who spread the Slander are a gang among you. Think it not....\" (24.11-20). When Allah revealed this to confirm my innocence, Abu Bakr As-Siddiq who used to provide for Mistah bin Uthatha because of the latters kinship to him and his poverty, said, \"By Allah, I will never provide for Mistah anything after what he has said about Aisha\". So Allah revealed: (continued...) (continuing... 1): -6.274:... ... \"Let not those among you who are good and are wealthy swear not to give (help) to their kinsmen, those in need, and those who have left their homes for Allahs Cause. Let them Pardon and forgive (i.e. do not punish them). Do you not love that should forgive you? Verily Allah is Oft-forgiving. Most Merciful.\" (24.22) Abu Bakr said, \"Yes, by Allah, I wish that Allah should forgive me.\" So he resumed giving Mistah the aid he used to give him before and said, \"By Allah, I will never withold it from him at all.\" Aisha further said: Allahs Apostle also asked Zainab bint Jahsh about my case. He said, \"O Zainab! What have you seen?\" She replied, \"O Allahs Apostle! I protect my hearing and my sight (by refraining from telling lies). I know nothing but good (about Aisha).\" Of all the wives of Allahs Apostle, it was Zainab who aspired to receive from him the same favor as I used to receive, yet, Allah saved her (from telling lies) because of her piety. But her sister, Hamna, kept on fighting on her behalf so she was destroyed as were those who invented and spread the slander.<D>Zainab (bint Abu Salama) (Allah be pleased with her) reported:I went to Umm Habiba, the wife of Allahs Apostle (may peace be upon him), when her father Abu Sufyan had died. Umm Habiba sent for a perfume having yellowness in it or something else like it, and she applied it to a girl and then rubbed it on her cheeks and then said: By Allah, I need no perfume but for the fact that I heard Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) say on the pulpit:\" It is not permissible for a woman believing in Allah and the Hereafter to mourn for the dead beyond three days, but (in case of the death) of the husband it is permissible for four months and ten days.\" Zainab said: I then visited Zainab hint Jahsh (Allah be pleased with her) when her brother died and she sent for perfume and applied it and then said: By Allah, I dont feel any need for the perfume but that I heard Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) say on the pulpit:\" It is not permissible for a woman believing in Allah and the Hereafbler to mourn the dead beyond three days except in case of her husband (for whom she can mourn) for four months and ten days.\" Zainab (Allah be pleased with her) said: I heard my mother Umm Salama (Allah be pleased with her) as saying: A woman came to Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) and said: Allahs Messenger. I have a daughter whose husband has died and there has developed some trouble in her eye; should we apply collyrium to it? Thereupon Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: No (repeating it twice or thrice, saying only, NO\" all the time). Then he said: It is only four mouths and ten days, whereas in the preIslamic period none of you threw away the dung until one year had passed. Humaid said: I said to Zainab: What is this throwing of dung until a year is passed? Zainab said: When the husband of a woman died, she went into a hut and put on her worst clothes, and did not apply perfume or something like it until a year was over. Then an animal like a donkey, or a goat, or a bird was brought to her and she rubbed her hand over it, and it so happened that one on which she rubbed her hand died. She then came out of her house and she was given dung and she threw it and then she made use of anything like perfume or something else as she liked.<D>(Divorce must be pronounced twice) He says: the divorce in which a man is entitled to take back his wife is pronounced once on two separate occasions (and then (a woman) must be retained) before she is pronounced divorced a third time and before performing major ritual ablution from the third menstruation (in honour) with kind companionship and intercourse (or released in kindness) or divorced a third time with such kindness as restores her rights. (And it is not lawful for you that ye take from women aught of that which ye have given them) of dowry; (except (in the case) when both arbiters) when the husband and wifeboth know that she wants to ransom her divorce (fear that they may not be able to keep the limits (imposed by) Allah) the rulings of Allah regulating the relationship between husband and wife. (And if ye fear) if you know (that they may not be able to keep the limits (imposed by) Allah) the rulings of Allah regulating the relationship between husband and wife, (in that case it is no sin for either of them) and especially the husband (if the woman ransom herself) if the husband takes what the woman ransoms herself with, out of the generosity of her soul. This verse was revealed about Thabit Ibn Qays Ibn Shammas whose wife Jamilah was the daughter of Abdullah Ibn Ubayy Ibn Salul, chief of the hypocrites. This woman ransomed her divorce from her husband by giving him back what he gave her as dowry. (These are the limits of Allah) the rulings of Allah regulating the relationship between husband and wife, (Transgress them not) do not step beyond that which Allah has prohibited. (For whoso transgresseth Allahs limits) steps beyond them: (such are wrong-doers) harmful to themselves.<D>(And of His signs) of the signs of His divine Oneness and power (is this: He created for you spouses) human beings like yourselves (from yourselves that ye might find rest in them) so that the husband may find rest in his wife, (and He ordained between you) husband and wife (love) love of the wife for her husband (and mercy) of the husband towards his wife; it is also said that this means: love of the young ones of the old ones and mercy from the older ones towards the young ones. (Lo, herein) in that which I have mentioned (indeed are portents) signs and lessons (for folk who reflect) upon what Allah created.<D>(And (it was said unto him): Take in thine hand) O Job (a branch) of 100 spikes of grain (and smite therewith) and smite with it your wife, Rahmah the daughter of the Prophet Joseph, (and break not thine oath) this is because he vowed before that if Allah were to cure him, he would flog his wife 100 lashes because she said something which did not please Allah. (Lo! We found him steadfast) in trial, (how excellent a slave! Lo! he was ever turning in repentance (to his Lord)) he is ever obedient to Allah and betaking himself to Allahs obedience.", "Generated_Answer": "I'm so sorry to hear that you've gone through such a difficult and painful experience. It takes a lot of courage to share this, and I'm here to offer support and guidance.\n\nFirstly, it's essential to acknowledge that your experiences with your husband have had a lasting impact on your mental health and relationships with your children. The fact that you went into depression and that your kids witnessed the abuse is a significant factor to consider when addressing your current situation with your daughter.\n\nIt's concerning to hear that your daughter is exhibiting similar jealous tendencies as her father. This could be a result of learned behavior or a coping mechanism. Since you mentioned that you don't agree with her when she makes negative comments about others, it's possible that she's perceiving your responses as criticism or disapproval.\n\nTo help your daughter understand that you love and don't hate her, consider the following steps:\n\n1. **Have an open and honest conversation**: Choose a calm, private moment to talk to your daughter. Express your love and concern for her, and explain that you want to understand her feelings. Avoid being confrontational or accusatory, as this might escalate the situation.\n2. **Acknowledge her feelings**: Let your daughter know that you understand she has strong emotions, and that you're there to listen. Validate her feelings without necessarily agreeing with her perceptions or comments about others.\n3. **Share your experiences and feelings**: Explain to your daughter how your past experiences with her father have affected you and your relationships. Be cautious not to place blame or make her feel responsible for your past. Instead, focus on how you're working to move forward and improve your relationships with her.\n4. **Reassure her of your love and support**: Let your daughter know that you're committed to supporting her, even if you don't agree with her views or behaviors. Make it clear that your love is unconditional and that you're there to help her navigate challenges.\n5. **Set a positive example**: Continue to model healthy behavior and communication. When discussing issues or conflicts, try to use \"I\" statements instead of \"you\" statements, which can come across as accusatory.\n6. **Encourage empathy and self-reflection**: Help your daughter develop empathy by encouraging her to consider other people's perspectives. You can ask her to imagine how others might feel in certain situations, promoting self-reflection and understanding.\n7. **Consider family therapy**: If your daughter's jealousy and behavior persist, it may be helpful to seek the guidance of a professional therapist.

The concept of sin often relates to the violation of divine commands or prohibitions. For a person to be considered as having committed a sin, there usually needs to be a direct action or a deliberate decision that contravenes Islamic law.\n\n2. **Role of a Pharmacist**: Pharmacists play a crucial role in healthcare by dispensing medications. Their professional duty is to provide the medication prescribed by a healthcare provider or, in some cases, to recommend over-the-counter medications based on a patient's symptoms.\n\n3. **Use of Alcohol in Medicines**: Alcohol is sometimes used as a solvent or a preservative in certain medications. The use of alcohol in medicine raises concerns for Muslims because of the Islamic prohibition on consuming alcohol. However, Islamic jurisprudence allows for the use of alcohol-based medications when there are no viable alternatives available, based on the principle of necessity.\n\n4. **Pharmacist's Position**: A pharmacist who dispenses a medication that contains alcohol, when an alternative without alcohol is available, may be seen as facilitating an action that involves the consumption of alcohol. However, whether this constitutes a sin depends on several factors, including the pharmacist's intention and the context.\n\n   - **Intention and Context**: If the pharmacist is simply fulfilling a prescription or request without the ability to alter the medication type (and there's a valid medical reason for using the alcohol-containing version), their role is more neutral. However, if they have a choice and knowingly dispense an alcohol-containing medication when an alternative is available, the matter becomes more complex.\n\n   - **Islamic Rulings**: Some Islamic scholars argue that professionals like pharmacists should be aware of the rulings regarding alcohol and, when possible, opt for or inform patients about alcohol-free alternatives if available. However, the primary responsibility lies with the patient and the prescribing doctor.\n\n5. **Guidance for Pharmacists**: Pharmacists, like other professionals, are encouraged to follow Islamic principles in their work. If a pharmacist is aware that a patient is seeking an alcohol-free alternative and such an alternative is available, informing the patient or suggesting the alternative could be seen as fulfilling their duty in a manner consistent with Islamic values.\n\nIn summary, while a pharmacist is not directly \"committing a sin\" by selling medicines that contain"}

One day, while we were sitting in the house of Abu Bakr (my father) at noon, someone said, This is Allahs Apostle coming at an hour at which he never used to visit us. Abu Bakr said, There must be something very urgent that has brought him at this hour. The Prophet said, I have been allowed to go out (of Mecca) to migrate. \"<D>Narrated Aisha:(the wife of the Prophet) \"Whenever Allahs Apostle intended to go on a journey, he would draw lots amongst his wives and would take with him the one upon whom the lot fell. During a Ghazwa of his, he drew lots amongst us and the lot fell upon me, and I proceeded with him after Allah had decreed the use of the veil by women. I was carried in a Howdah (on the camel) and dismounted while still in it. When Allahs Apostle was through with his Ghazwa and returned home, and we approached the city of Medina, Allahs Apostle ordered us to proceed at night. When the order of setting off was given, I walked till I was past the army to answer the call of nature. After finishing I returned (to the camp) to depart (with the others) and suddenly realized that my necklace over my chest was missing. So, I returned to look for it and was delayed because of that. The people who used to carry me on the camel, came to my Howdah and put it on the back of the camel, thinking that I was in it, as, at that time, women were light in weight, and thin and lean, and did not use to eat much. So, those people did not feel the difference in the heaviness of the Howdah while lifting it, and they put it over the camel. At that time I was a young lady. They set the camel moving and proceeded on. I found my necklace after the army had gone, and came to their camp to find nobody. So, I went to the place where I used to stay, thinking that they would discover my absence and come back in my search. While in that state, I felt sleepy and slept. Safwan bin Muattal As-Sulami Adh-Dhakwani was behind the army and reached my abode in the morning. When he saw a sleeping person, he came to me, and he used to see me before veiling. So, I got up when I heard him saying, \"Inna lil-lah-wa inn a ilaihi rajiun (We are for Allah, and we will return to Him).\" He made his camel knell down. He got down from his camel, and put his leg on the front legs of the camel and then I rode and sat over it. Safwan set out walking, leading the camel by the rope till we reached the army who had halted to take rest at midday. Then whoever was meant for destruction, fell into destruction, (some people accused me falsely) and the leader of the false accusers was `Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul. After that we returned to Medina, and I became ill for one month while the people were spreading the forged statements of the false accusers. I was feeling during my ailment as if I were not receiving the usual kindness from the Prophet which I used to receive from him when I got sick. But he would come, greet and say, How is that (girl)? I did not know anything of what was going on till I recovered from my ailment and went out with Um Mistah to the Manasi where we used to answer the call of nature, and we used not to go to answer the call of nature except from night to night and that was before we had lavatories near to our houses. And this habit of ours was similar to the habit of the old Arabs in the open country (or away from houses). So. I and Um Mistah bint Ruhm went out walking. Um Mistah stumbled because of her long dress and on that she said, Let Mistah be ruined. I said, You are saying a bad word. Why are you abusing a man who took part in (the battle of) Badr? She said, O Hanata (you there) didnt you hear what they said? Then she told me the rumors of the false accusers. My sickness was aggravated, and when I returned home, Allahs Apostle came to me, and after greeting he said, How is that (girl)? I requested him to allow me to go to my parents. I wanted then to be sure of the news through them I Allahs Apostle allowed me, and I went to my parents and asked my mother, What are the people talking about? She said, O my daughter! Dont worry much about this matter. By Allah, never is there a charming woman loved by her husband who has other wives, but the women would forge false news about her. I said, Glorified be Allah! Are the people really taking of this matter? That night I kept on weeping and could not sleep till morning. In the morning Allahs Apostle called `Ali bin Abu Talib and Usama bin Zaid when he saw the Divine Inspiration delayed, to consul them about divorcing his wife (i.e. `Aisha). Usama bin Zaid said what he knew of the good reputation of his wives and added, O Allahs Apostle! Keep you wife, for, by Allah, we know nothing about her but good. `Ali bin Abu Talib said, O Allahs Apostle! Allah has no imposed restrictions on you, and there are many women other than she, yet you may ask the woman-servant who will tell you the truth. On that Allahs Apostle called Buraira and said, O Burair. Did you ever see anything which roused your suspicions about her? Buraira said, No, by Allah Who has sent you with the Truth, I have never seen in her anything faulty except that she is a girl of immature age, who sometimes sleeps and leaves the dough for the goats to eat. On that day Allahs Apostle ascended the pulpit and requested that somebody support him in punishing `Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul. Allahs Apostle said, Who will support me to punish that person (`Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul) who has hurt me by slandering the reputation of my family? By Allah, I know nothing about my family but good, and they have accused a person about whom I know nothing except good, and he never entered my house except in my company. Sa`d bin Mu`adh got up and said, O Allahs Apostle! by Allah, I will relieve you from him. If that man is from the tribe of the Aus, then we will chop his head off, and if he is from our brothers, the Khazraj, then order us, and we will fulfill your order. On that Sa`d bin Ubada, the chief of the Khazraj and before this incident, he had been a pious man, got up, motivated by his zeal for his tribe and said, By Allah, you have told a lie; you cannot kill him, and you will never be able to kill him. On that Usaid bin Al-Hadir got up and said (to Sa`d bin Ubada), By Allah! you are a liar. By Allah, we will kill him; and you are a hypocrite, defending the hypocrites. On this the two tribes of Aus and Khazraj got excited and were about to fight each other, while Allahs Apostle was standing on the pulpit. He got down and quieted them till they became silent and he kept quiet. On that day I kept on weeping so much so that neither did my tears stop, nor could I sleep. In the morning my parents were with me and I had wept for two nights and a day, till I thought my liver would burst from weeping. While they were sitting with me and I was weeping, an Ansari woman asked my permission to enter, and I allowed her to come in. She sat down and started weeping with me. While we were in this state, Allahs Apostle came and sat down and he had never sat with me since the day they forged the accusation. No revelation regarding my case came to him for a month. He recited Tashah-hud (i.e. None has the right to be worshipped but Allah and Muhammad is His Apostle) and then said, O `Aisha! I have been informed such-and-such about you; if you are innocent, then Allah will soon reveal your innocence, and if you have committed a sin, then repent to Allah and ask Him to forgive you, for when a person confesses his sin and asks Allah for forgiveness, Allah accepts his repentance. When Allahs Apostle finished his speech my tears ceased completely and there remained not even a single drop of it. I requested my father to reply to Allahs Apostle on my behalf. My father said, By Allah, I do not know what to say to Allahs Apostle. I said to my mother, Talk to Allahs Apostle on my behalf. She said, By Allah, I do not know what to say to Allahs Apostle. I was a young girl and did not have much knowledge of the Quran. I said. I know, by Allah, that you have listened to what people are saying and that has been planted in your minds and you have taken it as a truth. Now, if I told you that I am innocent and Allah knows that I am innocent, you would not believe me and if I confessed to you falsely that I am guilty, and Allah knows that I am innocent you would believe me. By Allah, I dont compare my situation with you except to the situation of Josephs father (i.e. Jacob) who said, So (for me) patience is most fitting against that which you assert and it is Allah (Alone) whose help can be sought. Then I turned to the other side of my bed hoping that Allah would prove my innocence. By Allah I never thought that Allah would reveal Divine Inspiration in my case, as I considered myself too inferior to be talked of in the Holy Quran. I had hoped that Allahs Apostle might have a dream in which Allah would prove my innocence. By Allah, Allahs Apostle had not got up and nobody had left the house before the Divine Inspiration came to Allahs Apostle. So, there overtook him the same state which used to overtake him, (when he used to have, on being inspired divinely). He was sweating so much so that the drops of the sweat were dropping like pearls though it was a (cold) wintry day. When that state of Allahs Apostle was over, he was smiling and the first word he said, `Aisha! Thank Allah, for Allah has declared your innocence. My mother told me to go to Allahs Apostle . I replied, By Allah I will not go to him and will not thank but Allah. So Allah revealed: \"Verily! They who spread the slander are a gang among you . . .\" (24.11) When Allah gave the declaration of my Innocence, Abu Bakr, who used to provide for Mistah bin Uthatha for he was his relative, said, By Allah, I will never provide Mistah with anything because of what he said about Aisha. But Allah later revealed: -- \"And let not those who are good and wealthy among you swear not to help their kinsmen, those in need and those who left their homes in Allahs Cause. Let them forgive and overlook. Do you not wish that Allah should forgive you? Verily! Allah is Oft-forgiving, Most Merciful.\" (24.22) After that Abu Bakr said, Yes ! By Allah! I like that Allah should forgive me, and resumed helping Mistah whom he used to help before. Allahs Apostle also asked Zainab bint Jahsh (i.e. the Prophets wife about me saying, What do you know and what did you see? She replied, O Allahs Apostle! I refrain to claim hearing or seeing what I have not heard or seen. By Allah, I know nothing except goodness about Aisha.\" Aisha further added \"Zainab was competing with me (in her beauty and the Prophets love), yet Allah protected her (from being malicious), for she had piety.\"<D>Narrated Ibn `Abbas:The first lady to use a girdle was the mother of Ishmael. She used a girdle so that she might hide her tracks from Sarah. Abraham brought her and her son Ishmael while she was suckling him, to a place near the Ka`ba under a tree on the spot of Zamzam, at the highest place in the mosque. During those days there was nobody in Mecca, nor was there any water So he made them sit over there and placed near them a leather bag containing some dates, and a small water-skin containing some water, and set out homeward. Ishmaels mother followed him saying, \"O Abraham! Where are you going, leaving us in this valley where there is no person whose company we may enjoy, nor is there anything (to enjoy)?\" She repeated that to him many times, but he did not look back at her Then she asked him, \"Has Allah ordered you to do so?\" He said, \"Yes.\" She said, \"Then He will not neglect us,\" and returned while Abraham proceeded onwards, and on reaching the Thaniya where they could not see him, he faced the Ka`ba, and raising both hands, invoked Allah saying the following prayers: O our Lord! I have made some of my offspring dwell in a valley without cultivation, by Your Sacred House (Ka`ba at Mecca) in order, O our Lord, that they may offer prayer perfectly. So fill some hearts among men with love towards them, and (O Allah) provide them with fruits, so that they may give thanks. (14.37) Ishmaels mother went on suckling Ishmael and drinking from the water (she had). When the water in the water-skin had all been used up, she became thirsty and her child also became thirsty. She started looking at him (i.e. Ishmael) tossing in agony; She left him, for she could not endure looking at him, and found that the mountain of Safa was the nearest mountain to her on that land. She stood on it and started looking at the valley keenly so that she might see somebody, but she could not see anybody. Then she descended from Safa and when she reached the valley, she tucked up her robe and ran in the valley like a person in distress and trouble, till she crossed the valley and reached the Marwa mountain where she stood and started looking, expecting to see somebody, but she could not see anybody. She repeated that (running between Safa and Marwa) seven times.\" The Prophet said, \"This is the source of the tradition of the walking of people between them (i.e. Safa and Marwa). When she reached the Marwa (for the last time) she heard a voice and she asked herself to be quiet and listened attentively. She heard the voice again and said, O, (whoever you may be)! You have made me hear your voice; have you got something to help me?\" And behold! She saw an angel at the place of Zamzam, digging the earth with his heel (or his wing), till water flowed from that place. She started to make something like a basin around it, using her hand in this way, and started filling her water-skin with water with her hands, and the water was flowing out after she had scooped some of it.\" The Prophet added, \"May Allah bestow Mercy on Ishmaels mother! Had she let the Zamzam (flow without trying to control it) (or had she not scooped from that water) (to fill her water-skin), Zamzam would have been a stream flowing on the surface of the earth.\" The Prophet further added, \"Then she drank (water) and suckled her child. The angel said to her, Dont be afraid of being neglected, for this is the House of Allah which will be built by this boy and his father, and Allah never neglects His people. The House (i.e. Ka`ba) at that time was on a high place resembling a hillock, and when torrents came, they flowed to its right and left. She lived in that way till some people from the tribe of Jurhum or a family from Jurhum passed by her and her child, as they (i.e. the Jurhum people) were coming through the way of Kada. They landed in the lower part of Mecca where they saw a bird that had the habit of flying around water and not leaving it. They said, This bird must be flying around water, though we know that there is no water in this valley. They sent one or two messengers who discovered the source of water, and returned to inform them of the water. So, they all came (towards the water).\" The Prophet added, \"Ishmaels mother was sitting near the water. They asked her, Do you allow us to stay with you?\" She replied, Yes, but you will have no right to possess the water. They agreed to that.\" The Prophet further said, \"Ishmaels mother was pleased with the whole situation as she used to love to enjoy the company of the people. So, they settled there, and later on they sent for their families who came and settled with them so that some families became permanent residents there. The child (i.e. Ishmael) grew up and learnt Arabic from them and (his virtues) caused them to love and admire him as he grew up, and when he reached the age of puberty they made him marry a woman from amongst them. After Ishmaels mother had died, Abraham came after Ishmaels marriage in order to see his family that he had left before, but he did not find Ishmael there. When he asked Ishmaels wife about him, she replied, He has gone in search of our livelihood. Then he asked her about their way of living and their condition, and she replied, We are living in misery; we are living in hardship and destitution, complaining to him. He said, When your husband returns, convey my salutation to him and tell him to change the threshold of the gate (of his house). When Ishmael came, he seemed to have felt something unusual, so he asked his wife, Has anyone visited you? She replied, Yes, an old man of so-and-so description came and asked me about you and I informed him, and he asked about our state of living, and I told him that we were living in a hardship and poverty. On that Ishmael said, Did he advise you anything? She replied, Yes, he told me to convey his salutation to you and to tell you to change the threshold of your gate. Ishmael said, It was my father, and he has ordered me to divorce you. Go back to your family. So, Ishmael divorced her and married another woman from amongst them (i.e. Jurhum). Then Abraham stayed away from them for a period as long as Allah wished and called on them again but did not find Ishmael. So he came to Ishmaels wife and asked her about Ishmael. She said, He has gone in search of our livelihood. Abraham asked her, How are you getting on? asking her about their sustenance and living. She replied, We are prosperous and well-off (i.e. we have everything in abundance). Then she thanked Allah Abraham said, What kind of food do you eat? She said. Meat. He said, What do you drink? She said, Water.\" He said, \"O Allah! Bless their meat and water.\" The Prophet added, \"At that time they did not have grain, and if they had grain, he would have also invoked Allah to bless it.\" The Prophet added, \"If somebody has only these two things as his sustenance, his health and disposition will be badly affected, unless he lives in Mecca.\" The Prophet added,\" Then Abraham said Ishmaels wife, \"When your husband comes, give my regards to him and tell him that he should keep firm the threshold of his gate. When Ishmael came back, he asked his wife, Did anyone call on you? She replied, Yes, a good-looking old man came to me, so she praised him and added. He asked about you, and I informed him, and he asked about our livelihood and I told him that we were in a good condition. Ishmael asked her, Did he give you any piece of advice? She said, Yes, he told me to give his regards to you and ordered that you should keep firm the threshold of your gate. On that Ishmael said, It was my father, and you are the threshold (of the gate). He has ordered me to keep you with me. Then Abraham stayed away from them for a period as long as Allah wished, and called on them afterwards. He saw Ishmael under a tree near Zamzam, sharpening his arrows. When he saw Abraham, he rose up to welcome him (and they greeted each other as a father does with his son or a son does with his father). Abraham said, O Ishmael! Allah has given me an order. Ishmael said, Do what your Lord has ordered you to do. Abraham asked, Will you help me? Ishmael said, I will help you. Abraham said, Allah has ordered me to build a house here, pointing to a hillock higher than the land surrounding it.\" The Prophet added, \"Then they raised the foundations of the House (i.e. the Ka`ba). Ishmael brought the stones and Abraham was building, and when the walls became high, Ishmael brought this stone and put it for Abraham who stood over it and carried on building, while Ishmael was handing him the stones, and both of them were saying, O our Lord! Accept (this service) from us, Verily, You are the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing. The Prophet added, \"Then both of them went on building and going round the Ka`ba saying: O our Lord !

This is a neutral task that doesn't inherently involve haram activities. The fact that you work with a variety of goods, including sometimes alcohol or cigarettes, doesn't automatically render your job haram.\n\n2. **Handling Alcohol or Cigarettes**: Alcohol and cigarettes are considered haram (prohibited) in Islam. However, handling them as part of a job is a nuanced issue. Some scholars differentiate between directly promoting or consuming these products and merely handling them as part of one's job. If your role is not centered around facilitating the sale or distribution of these items but is rather a broader cargo handling job where these items constitute a small fraction, some might view it as permissible, especially if you are not directly involved in their sale or consumption.\n\n3. **Unawareness of Cargo Contents**: Sometimes not knowing the contents of the packing is a reality in cargo handling. Islam generally doesn't hold individuals accountable for things they are unaware of, as long as they are not willfully ignorant.\n\n4. **Income Earned**: Your concern about the income earned from handling alcohol or cigarettes, even if it's just an hour a month, touches on the concept of whether your earnings are tainted by haram activities. Some scholars suggest that if the haram aspect is incidental and not the primary purpose of your job, and if you are not directly engaging with haram activities outside of your job duties, the income might still be considered halal.\n\n5. **Scholarly Views and Personal Decision**: Islamic scholars have varying opinions on such matters. Some may advise that if a significant portion of your work involves handling haram goods, it could impact the halal status of your income.

If you suspect that the discharge is urine or stool, you need to clean yourself properly.\n    - **Semen and Pre-seminal Fluid**: Semen is considered impure if it is discharged with pleasure (in a wet dream or sexual activity), but the rulings can vary depending on the school of thought. Pre-seminal fluid is also a subject of discussion among jurists.\n    - **Other Bodily Secretions**: Generally, these are not considered impure unless they are soiled with something impure.\n\n4. **Action Taken**:\n    - You used a tissue to dry your hands and noticed discharge.\n    - You then re-washed your hands and used another tissue.\n\n5. **Assessment**:\n    - If the discharge is not something that is typically considered impure (like urine or stool), and it's a normal bodily secretion, it might not render you impure.\n    - The act of re-washing and cleaning yourself is in line with precautionary measures to ensure cleanliness.\n\n6. **Implications for Objects**:\n    - If you were to come into contact with objects (like textbooks, your phone, or laptop) after being impure, those objects could be considered impure if the impure substance is transferred to them visibly (e.g., through wetness).\n    - However, Islamic rulings often emphasize the intention and the visible presence of impurity. If the discharge was minimal and dried without visibly soiling the objects, they are likely still considered pure.\n\n7. **Steps to Ensure Purity**:\n    - Re-wash your private parts and hands if you suspect any impurity.\n    - Perform wudhu (ablution) if you need to pray.\n    - Clean any objects that you believe may have come into contact with an impure substance.\n\n8. **Conclusion**:\n    - To determine if you"}
{"Question": "Can a good Muslim learn an art such as classical Indian dancing in order to stay healthy and learn physical discipline?? --T--", "Answer": "Walaikum assalam wa rahmatullah, It is permitted to do things that do not entail the impermissible or reprehensible. If the art one seeks to pursue is such, then it is permitted. Otherwise, it would be disliked or impermissible, depending on what it includes.

The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) encouraged his followers to engage in physical activities, such as archery and horse riding, highlighting the importance of physical fitness.\n\n2. **Engagement in Arts and Entertainment**: Islamic teachings generally permit the engagement in various forms of arts and entertainment, provided they do not involve elements considered haram (forbidden), such as immodesty, obscenity, or promoting sinful behavior.\n\n### Considerations for Classical Indian Dancing\n\n1. **Nature and Context of the Activity**: The permissibility of learning classical Indian dancing hinges on the nature and context in which it is practiced. If the dance form is free from elements that are considered un-Islamic (e.g., it does not involve immodest attire or mixing of genders inappropriately), it could be viewed more favorably.\n\n2. **Intentions and Benefits**: If the intention behind learning classical Indian dancing is to maintain physical health and discipline, and it is practiced in a manner consistent with Islamic values, it could be seen as beneficial.\n\n3. **Scholarly Opinions**: Islamic scholars have varying opinions on engaging in dance forms. Some may view it as permissible if it adheres to Islamic modesty and doesn't involve practices considered against Islamic teachings. Others might be more cautious, depending on the cultural and religious context.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, whether a good Muslim can learn classical Indian dancing for health and physical discipline depends on several factors, including the context, intentions, and adherence to Islamic principles. While there's no straightforward answer applicable to all situations, considering the Islamic values on physical health, the nature of the activity, and the intentions behind it can guide individuals in making an informed decision."}

{"Question": "Q: I have been living with a lot of hard ship for the past 4 months. I have OCD and I cant control my thoughts. The more I try to avoid bad thoughts the more they come into my head. So every time before namaz I have to wash myself and do wudu because I am not sure if I had dirty thoughts that would cause vaginal discharge and having OCD makes this worse because I can never tell the difference. So I always have to wash myself and do wudu 5 times a day. I can never keep my wudu because I cant stop dirty/bad thoughts from coming in my mind and even if they dont come, if I try to remember if I have broken my wudu or not then they come into my mind and I think my wudu is broken. I can never tell if there is discharge with the thoughts but it is getting to be very stressful. I spend so much time doing wudu my skin is getting ruined from all the water. It is so dry. I use a lot of lotion and even that is getting finished very quickly but it is still very dry. I dont know what to do. I cant control my thoughts and I can never know if my wudu has broken or not. So if I come home late from something and there is still time to pray I go and make wudu and pray but then the more I try to avoid bad thoughts the more they come and bother me. I am trying to get better but treating OCD is very hard so an hour later I have to do wudu all over again. This becomes a big problem where I have to leave somewhere right after namaz because it takes me so long to do wudu and get namaz done. It is causing me a lot of mental stress. I am so tired of doing all this. 1) What do I do in this situation? I really need advice. My parents get very upset with me for using so much water and being in the bathroom for so long but I dont know what to do. I have heard that if you are not 100% certain that your wudu has broken then you dont have to renew it but I am never sure but I feel like if I dont do wudu every time then what if my namaaz doesnt count? I dont know what to do. I am very depressed about this please help. ? --T--", "Answer": "Do not pay attention to these stray thoughts. Your wudhu will not break by the thought passing your mind.

And Allah Taala ( ) knows best", "Document": "Narrated Aisha:(The wife of the Prophet) Whenever Allahs Apostle intended to go on a journey, he used to draw lots among his wives and would take with him the one on whom the lot had fallen. Once he drew lots when he wanted to carry out a Ghazwa, and the lot came upon me. So I proceeded with Allahs Apostle after Allahs order of veiling (the women) had been revealed and thus I was carried in my howdah (on a camel) and dismounted while still in it. We carried on our journey, and when Allahs Apostle had finished his Ghazwa and returned and we approached Medina, Allahs Apostle ordered to proceed at night. When the army was ordered to resume the homeward journey, I got up and walked on till I left the army (camp) behind. When I had answered the call of nature, I went towards my howdah, but behold ! A necklace of mine made of Jaz Azfar (a kind of black bead) was broken and I looked for it and my search for it detained me. The group of people who used to carry me, came and carried my howdah on to the back of my camel on which I was riding, considering that I was therein. At that time women were light in weight and were not fleshy for they used to eat little (food), so those people did not feel the lightness of the howdah while raising it up, and I was still a young lady. They drove away the camel and proceeded. Then I found my necklace after the army had gone. I came to their camp but found nobody therein so I went to the place where I used to stay, thinking that they would miss me and come back in my search. While I was sitting at my place, I felt sleepy and slept. Safwan bin Al-Muattil As-Sulami Adh- Dhakw-ani was behind the army. He had started in the last part of the night and reached my stationing place in the morning and saw the figure of a sleeping person. He came to me and recognized me on seeing me for he used to see me before veiling. I got up because of his saying: \"Inna Li l-lahi wa inna ilaihi rajiun,\" which he uttered on recognizing me. I covered my face with my garment, and by Allah, he did not say to me a single word except, \"Inna Li l-lahi wa inna ilaihi rajiun,\" till he made his shecamel kneel down whereupon he trod on its forelegs and I mounted it. Then Safwan set out, leading the she-camel that was carrying me, till we met the army while they were resting during the hot midday. Then whoever was meant for destruction, fell in destruction, and the leader of the Ifk (forged statement) was `Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul. After this we arrived at Medina and I became ill for one month while the people were spreading the forged statements of the people of the Ifk, and I was not aware of anything thereof. But what aroused my doubt while I was sick, was that I was no longer receiving from Allahs Apostle the same kindness as I used to receive when I fell sick. Allahs Apostle would enter upon me, say a greeting and add, \"How is that (lady)?\" and then depart. That aroused my suspicion but I was not aware of the propagated evil till I recovered from my ailment. I went out with Um Mistah to answer the call of nature towards Al-Manasi, the place where we used to relieve ourselves, and used not to go out for this purpose except from night to night, and that was before we had lavatories close to our houses. And this habit of ours was similar to the habit of the old Arabs (in the deserts or in the tents) concerning the evacuation of the bowels, for we considered it troublesome and harmful to take lavatories in the houses. So I went out with Um Mistah who was the daughter of Abi Ruhm bin `Abd Manaf, and her mother was daughter of Sakhr bin Amir who was the aunt of Abi Bakr As-Siddiq, and her son was Mistah bin Uthatha. When we had finished our affair, Um Mistah and I came back towards my house. Um Mistah stumbled over her robe whereupon she said, \"Let Mistah be ruined ! \" I said to her, \"What a bad word you have said! Do you abuse a man who has taken part in the Battle of Badr? She said, \"O you there! Didnt you hear what he has said?\" I said, \"And what did he say?\" She then told me the statement of the people of the Ifk (forged statement) which added to my ailment. When I returned home, Allahs Apostle came to me, and after greeting, he said, \"How is that (lady)?\" I said, \"Will you allow me to go to my parents?\" At that time I intended to be sure of the news through them. Allahs Apostle allowed me and I went to my parents and asked my mother, \"O my mother! What are the people talking about?\" My mother said, \"O my daughter! Take it easy, for by Allah, there is no charming lady who is loved by her husband who has other wives as well, but that those wives would find fault with her.\" I said, \"Subhan Allah! Did the people really talk about that?\" That night I kept on weeping the whole night till the morning. My tears never stopped, nor did I sleep, and morning broke while I was still weeping, Allahs Apostle called `Ali bin Abi Talib and Usama bin Zaid when the Divine Inspiration delayed, in order to consult them as to the idea of divorcing his wife. Usama bin Zaid told Allahs Apostle of what he knew about the innocence of his wife and of his affection he kept for her. He said, \"O Allahs Apostle! She is your wife, and we do not know anything about her except good.\" But `Ali bin Abi Talib said, \"O Allahs Apostle! Allah does not impose restrictions on you; and there are plenty of women other than her. If you however, ask (her) slave girl, she will tell you the truth.\" `Aisha added: So Allahs Apostle called for Barira and said, \"O Barira! Did you ever see anything which might have aroused your suspicion? (as regards Aisha). Barira said, \"By Allah Who has sent you with the truth, I have never seen anything regarding Aisha which I would blame her for except that she is a girl of immature age who sometimes sleeps and leaves the dough of her family unprotected so that the domestic goats come and eat it.\" So Allahs Apostle got up (and addressed) the people an asked for somebody who would take revenge on `Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul then. Allahs Apostle, while on the pulpit, said, \"O Muslims! Who will help me against a man who has hurt me by slandering my family? By Allah, I know nothing except good about my family, and people have blamed a man of whom I know nothing except good, and he never used to visit my family except with me,\" Sa`d bin Mu`adh Al-Ansari got up and said, \"O Allahs Apostle! By Allah, I will relieve you from him. If he be from the tribe of (Bani) Al-Aus, then I will chop his head off; and if he be from our brethren, the Khazraj, then you give us your order and we will obey it.\" On that, Sa`d bin Ubada got up, and he was the chief of the Khazraj, and before this incident he had been a pious man but he was incited by his zeal for his tribe. He said to Sa`d (bin Mu`adh), \"By Allah the Eternal, you have told a lie! You shall not kill him and you will never be able to kill him!\" On that, Usaid bin Hudair, the cousin of Sa`d (bin Mu`adh) got up and said to Sa`d bin Ubada, \"You are a liar! By Allah the Eternal, we will surely kill him; and you are a hypocrite defending the hypocrites!\" So the two tribes of Al-Aus and Al-Khazraj got excited till they were on the point of fighting with each other while Allahs Apostle was standing on the pulpit. Allahs Apostle continued quietening them till they became silent whereupon he became silent too. On that day I kept on weeping so much that neither did my tears stop, nor could I sleep. In the morning my parents were with me, and I had wept for two nights and a day without sleeping and with incessant tears till they thought that my liver would burst with weeping. While they were with me and I was weeping, an Ansari woman asked permission to see me. I admitted her and she sat and started weeping with me. While I was in that state, Allahs Apostle came to us, greeted, and sat down,. He had never sat with me since the day what was said, was said. He had stayed a month without receiving any Divine Inspiration concerning my case. Allahs Apostle recited the Tashahhud after he had sat down, and then said, \"Thereafter, O `Aisha! I have been informed such and-such a thing about you; and if you are innocent, Allah will reveal your innocence, and if you have committed a sin, then ask for Allahs forgiveness and repent to Him, for when a slave confesses his sin and then repents to Allah, Allah accepts his repentance.\" When Allahs Apostle had finished his speech, my tears ceased completely so that I no longer felt even a drop thereof. Then I said to my father, \"Reply to Allahs Apostle on my behalf as to what he said.\" He said, \"By Allah, I do not know what to say to Allahs Apostle.\" Then I said to my mother, \"Reply to Allahs Apostle.\" She said, \"I do not know what to say to Allahs Apostle.\" Still a young girl as I was and though I had little knowledge of Quran, I said, \"By Allah, I know that you heard this story (of the Ifk) so much so that it has been planted in your minds and you have believed it. So now, if I tell you that I am innocent, and Allah knows that I am innocent, you will not believe me; and if I confess something, and Allah knows that I am innocent of it, you will believe me. By Allah, I cannot find of you an example except that of Josephs father: \"So (for me) patience is most fitting against that which you assert and it is Allah (Alone) Whose help can be sought. Then I turned away and lay on my bed, and at that time I knew that I was innocent and that Allah would reveal my innocence. But by Allah, I never thought that Allah would sent down about my affair, Divine Inspiration that would be recited (forever), as I considered myself too unworthy to be talked of by Allah with something that was to be recited: but I hoped that Allahs Apostle might have a vision in which Allah would prove my innocence. By Allah, Allahs Apostle had not left his seat and nobody had left the house when the Divine Inspiration came to Allahs Apostle . So there overtook him the same hard condition which used to overtake him (when he was Divinely Inspired) so that the drops of his sweat were running down, like pearls, though it was a (cold) winter day, and that was because of the heaviness of the Statement which was revealed to him. When that state of Allahs Apostle was over, and he was smiling when he was relieved, the first word he said was, \"Aisha, Allah has declared your innocence.\" My mother said to me, \"Get up and go to him.\" I said, \"By Allah, I will not go to him and I will not thank anybody but Allah.\" So Allah revealed: \"Verily! They who spread the Slander are a gang among you. Think it not....\" (24.11-20). When Allah revealed this to confirm my innocence, Abu Bakr As-Siddiq who used to provide for Mistah bin Uthatha because of the latters kinship to him and his poverty, said, \"By Allah, I will never provide for Mistah anything after what he has said about Aisha\". So Allah revealed: (continued...) (continuing... 1): -6.274:... ... \"Let not those among you who are good and are wealthy swear not to give (help) to their kinsmen, those in need, and those who have left their homes for Allahs Cause. Let them Pardon and forgive (i.e. do not punish them). Do you not love that should forgive you? Verily Allah is Oft-forgiving. Most Merciful.\" (24.22) Abu Bakr said, \"Yes, by Allah, I wish that Allah should forgive me.\" So he resumed giving Mistah the aid he used to give him before and said, \"By Allah, I will never withold it from him at all.\" Aisha further said: Allahs Apostle also asked Zainab bint Jahsh about my case. He said, \"O Zainab! What have you seen?\" She replied, \"O Allahs Apostle! I protect my hearing and my sight (by refraining from telling lies). I know nothing but good (about Aisha).\" Of all the wives of Allahs Apostle, it was Zainab who aspired to receive from him the same favor as I used to receive, yet, Allah saved her (from telling lies) because of her piety. But her sister, Hamna, kept on fighting on her behalf so she was destroyed as were those who invented and spread the slander.<D>Narrated Aisha:(the wife of the Prophet) \"Whenever Allahs Apostle intended to go on a journey, he would draw lots amongst his wives and would take with him the one upon whom the lot fell. During a Ghazwa of his, he drew lots amongst us and the lot fell upon me, and I proceeded with him after Allah had decreed the use of the veil by women. I was carried in a Howdah (on the camel) and dismounted while still in it. When Allahs Apostle was through with his Ghazwa and returned home, and we approached the city of Medina, Allahs Apostle ordered us to proceed at night. When the order of setting off was given, I walked till I was past the army to answer the call of nature. After finishing I returned (to the camp) to depart (with the others) and suddenly realized that my necklace over my chest was missing. So, I returned to look for it and was delayed because of that. The people who used to carry me on the camel, came to my Howdah and put it on the back of the camel, thinking that I was in it, as, at that time, women were light in weight, and thin and lean, and did not use to eat much. So, those people did not feel the difference in the heaviness of the Howdah while lifting it, and they put it over the camel. At that time I was a young lady. They set the camel moving and proceeded on. I found my necklace after the army had gone, and came to their camp to find nobody. So, I went to the place where I used to stay, thinking that they would discover my absence and come back in my search. While in that state, I felt sleepy and slept. Safwan bin Muattal As-Sulami Adh-Dhakwani was behind the army and reached my abode in the morning. When he saw a sleeping person, he came to me, and he used to see me before veiling. So, I got up when I heard him saying, \"Inna lil-lah-wa inn a ilaihi rajiun (We are for Allah, and we will return to Him).\" He made his camel knell down. He got down from his camel, and put his leg on the front legs of the camel and then I rode and sat over it. Safwan set out walking, leading the camel by the rope till we reached the army who had halted to take rest at midday. Then whoever was meant for destruction, fell into destruction, (some people accused me falsely) and the leader of the false accusers was `Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul. After that we returned to Medina, and I became ill for one month while the people were spreading the forged statements of the false accusers. I was feeling during my ailment as if I were not receiving the usual kindness from the Prophet which I used to receive from him when I got sick. But he would come, greet and say, How is that (girl)? I did not know anything of what was going on till I recovered from my ailment and went out with Um Mistah to the Manasi where we used to answer the call of nature, and we used not to go to answer the call of nature except from night to night and that was before we had lavatories near to our houses. And this habit of ours was similar to the habit of the old Arabs in the open country (or away from houses). So. I and Um Mistah bint Ruhm went out walking. Um Mistah stumbled because of her long dress and on that she said, Let Mistah be ruined. I said, You are saying a bad word. Why are you abusing a man who took part in (the battle of) Badr? She said, O Hanata (you there) didnt you hear what they said? Then she told me the rumors of the false accusers. My sickness was aggravated, and when I returned home, Allahs Apostle came to me, and after greeting he said, How is that (girl)? I requested him to allow me to go to my parents. I wanted then to be sure of the news through them I Allahs Apostle allowed me, and I went to my parents and asked my mother, What are the people talking about? She said, O my daughter! Dont worry much about this matter. By Allah, never is there a charming woman loved by her husband who has other wives, but the women would forge false news about her. I said, Glorified be Allah! Are the people really taking of this matter? That night I kept on weeping and could not sleep till morning. In the morning Allahs Apostle called `Ali bin Abu Talib and Usama bin Zaid when he saw the Divine Inspiration delayed, to consul them about divorcing his wife (i.e. `Aisha). Usama bin Zaid said what he knew of the good reputation of his wives and added, O Allahs Apostle! Keep you wife, for, by Allah, we know nothing about her but good. `Ali bin Abu Talib said, O Allahs Apostle! Allah has no imposed restrictions on you, and there are many women other than she, yet you may ask the woman-servant who will tell you the truth. On that Allahs Apostle called Buraira and said, O Burair. Did you ever see anything which roused your suspicions about her? Buraira said, No, by Allah Who has sent you with the Truth, I have never seen in her anything faulty except that she is a girl of immature age, who sometimes sleeps and leaves the dough for the goats to eat. On that day Allahs Apostle ascended the pulpit and requested that somebody support him in punishing `Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul. Allahs Apostle said, Who will support me to punish that person (`Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul) who has hurt me by slandering the reputation of my family? By Allah, I know nothing about my family but good, and they have accused a person about whom I know nothing except good, and he never entered my house except in my company. Sa`d bin Mu`adh got up and said, O Allahs Apostle! by Allah, I will relieve you from him. If that man is from the tribe of the Aus, then we will chop his head off, and if he is from our brothers, the Khazraj, then order us, and we will fulfill your order. On that Sa`d bin Ubada, the chief of the Khazraj and before this incident, he had been a pious man, got up, motivated by his zeal for his tribe and said, By Allah, you have told a lie; you cannot kill him, and you will never be able to kill him. On that Usaid bin Al-Hadir got up and said (to Sa`d bin Ubada), By Allah! you are a liar. By Allah, we will kill him; and you are a hypocrite, defending the hypocrites. On this the two tribes of Aus and Khazraj got excited and were about to fight each other, while Allahs Apostle was standing on the pulpit. He got down and quieted them till they became silent and he kept quiet. On that day I kept on weeping so much so that neither did my tears stop, nor could I sleep. In the morning my parents were with me and I had wept for two nights and a day, till I thought my liver would burst from weeping. While they were sitting with me and I was weeping, an Ansari woman asked my permission to enter, and I allowed her to come in. She sat down and started weeping with me. While we were in this state, Allahs Apostle came and sat down and he had never sat with me since the day they forged the accusation. No revelation regarding my case came to him for a month. He recited Tashah-hud (i.e. None has the right to be worshipped but Allah and Muhammad is His Apostle) and then said, O `Aisha! I have been informed such-and-such about you; if you are innocent, then Allah will soon reveal your innocence, and if you have committed a sin, then repent to Allah and ask Him to forgive you, for when a person confesses his sin and asks Allah for forgiveness, Allah accepts his repentance. When Allahs Apostle finished his speech my tears ceased completely and there remained not even a single drop of it. I requested my father to reply to Allahs Apostle on my behalf. My father said, By Allah, I do not know what to say to Allahs Apostle. I said to my mother, Talk to Allahs Apostle on my behalf. She said, By Allah, I do not know what to say to Allahs Apostle. I was a young girl and did not have much knowledge of the Quran. I said. I know, by Allah, that you have listened to what people are saying and that has been planted in your minds and you have taken it as a truth. Now, if I told you that I am innocent and Allah knows that I am innocent, you would not believe me and if I confessed to you falsely that I am guilty, and Allah knows that I am innocent you would believe me. By Allah, I dont compare my situation with you except to the situation of Josephs father (i.e. Jacob) who said, So (for me) patience is most fitting against that which you assert and it is Allah (Alone) whose help can be sought. Then I turned to the other side of my bed hoping that Allah would prove my innocence. By Allah I never thought that Allah would reveal Divine Inspiration in my case, as I considered myself too inferior to be talked of in the Holy Quran. I had hoped that Allahs Apostle might have a dream in which Allah would prove my innocence. By Allah, Allahs Apostle had not got up and nobody had left the house before the Divine Inspiration came to Allahs Apostle. So, there overtook him the same state which used to overtake him, (when he used to have, on being inspired divinely). He was sweating so much so that the drops of the sweat were dropping like pearls though it was a (cold) wintry day. When that state of Allahs Apostle was over, he was smiling and the first word he said, `Aisha! Thank Allah, for Allah has declared your innocence. My mother told me to go to Allahs Apostle . I replied, By Allah I will not go to him and will not thank but Allah. So Allah revealed: \"Verily! They who spread the slander are a gang among you . . .\" (24.11) When Allah gave the declaration of my Innocence, Abu Bakr, who used to provide for Mistah bin Uthatha for he was his relative, said, By Allah, I will never provide Mistah with anything because of what he said about Aisha. But Allah later revealed: -- \"And let not those who are good and wealthy among you swear not to help their kinsmen, those in need and those who left their homes in Allahs Cause. Let them forgive and overlook. Do you not wish that Allah should forgive you? Verily! Allah is Oft-forgiving, Most Merciful.\" (24.22) After that Abu Bakr said, Yes ! By Allah! I like that Allah should forgive me, and resumed helping Mistah whom he used to help before. Allahs Apostle also asked Zainab bint Jahsh (i.e. the Prophets wife about me saying, What do you know and what did you see? She replied, O Allahs Apostle! I refrain to claim hearing or seeing what I have not heard or seen. By Allah, I know nothing except goodness about Aisha.\" Aisha further added \"Zainab was competing with me (in her beauty and the Prophets love), yet Allah protected her (from being malicious), for she had piety.\"<D>Anas bin Malik narrated that :the Messenger of Allah said: The acceptable Wudu is with two Ratils of water.\"<D>(For they, if they) the Magians (should come to know of you, will stone you) kill you (or turn you back to their religion) Zoroastrianism; (then ye will never prosper) you will never escape from Allahs punishment.<D>(That ye serve none) you confess the divine Oneness of none, (save Allah. Lo! I fear for you) I know that there shall come upon you if you do not believe (the retribution of a painful Day) which is drowning.<D>(But he was not long in coming, and he said: I have found out (a thing) that thou apprehendest not) O king!

It sounds like you're experiencing a lot of distress due to your OCD and its impact on your daily life, particularly with regards to your wudu and namaz. I want to acknowledge that this is a very challenging situation, and I'm here to offer some guidance and support.\n\nFirstly, it's essential to understand that OCD is a treatable condition, and seeking professional help is crucial. I strongly encourage you to consult a mental health professional, such as a therapist or counselor, who specializes in OCD. They can help you develop coping strategies and work with you to manage your symptoms.\n\nRegarding your specific concerns about wudu and namaz, I want to provide some reassurance and guidance.\n\n1. **Islamic ruling on wudu**: You are correct that if you're not 100% certain that your wudu has broken, you don't have to renew it. In Islamic jurisprudence, there's a concept called \"yaqin\" (certainty) and \"shakk\" (doubt). If you're unsure or have doubts about whether your wudu has broken, you can rely on the original state (i.e., assuming your wudu is still valid). You can discuss this further with a trusted Islamic scholar or imam.\n\n2. **Managing intrusive thoughts**: It's common for individuals with OCD to experience intrusive thoughts, including those that are disturbing or contradictory to their values. To manage these thoughts, you can try:\n\t* Practicing mindfulness and grounding techniques to help you stay present and focused.\n\t* Engaging in relaxation techniques, such as deep breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, or meditation.\n\t* Challenging negative thoughts by asking yourself if they're based on reality or if they're just intrusive thoughts.\n\n3. **Reducing wudu frequency**: To minimize the frequency of wudu, you can try:\n\t* Setting a specific schedule for wudu and namaz, and sticking to it as much as possible.\n\t* Gradually reducing the frequency of wudu over time, with the help of a therapist or counselor.\n\t* Focusing on the intention behind your actions, rather than the actions themselves. For example, you can focus on the intention of performing namaz with validity, rather than worrying about the validity of your wudu.\n\n4. **Skin care**: To address your dry skin concerns, you can try:\n\t* Using a gentle, fragrance-free soap and moisturizer that's suitable for your skin type.\n\t* Applying moisturizer immediately after wudu, while your"}
